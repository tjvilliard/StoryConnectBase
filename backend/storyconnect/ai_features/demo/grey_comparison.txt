There is a contradiction regarding Lord Henry Wotton's smoking habits - in the old text, he is described as a smoker, 
but in the new text, it is stated that he has never smoked. Additionally, there is a contradiction in the description of 
Dorian Gray - in the old text, he is described as an Adonis made of ivory and rose-leaves, but in the new text, he is 
described as old and decrepit. Finally, there is a contradiction in the description of the garden - in the old text, it 
is described as having a dim roar and being like the bourdon note of a distant organ, but in the new text, it is stated 
that the garden is barren and only has rose bushes.
