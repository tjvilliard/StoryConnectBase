In "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde, Lord Henry Wotton continues to manipulate and influence Dorian Gray, encouraging him to indulge in his desires. In the next chapter, Lord Henry visits his selfish uncle, Lord Fermor, and they discuss Dorian's scandalous family history. Lord Henry also reflects on his own desire to control and dominate others, particularly Dorian. As Dorian's obsession with pleasure and secrecy intensifies, the corrupting power of indulgence is revealed.
