In the artist's studio, Lord Henry and Basil discuss a portrait of Dorian Gray, with the room filled with the scent of roses and the sound of bees outside. Lord Henry encourages Basil to exhibit the portrait, but Basil refuses, feeling he has put too much of himself into it. Basil reveals that Dorian is the subject of the portrait and discusses the "fatality" of being different. Later, Basil tells Lord Henry about an encounter with Dorian at a party, where he felt a strange attraction but also a sense of fear. They also discuss conscience and cowardice, and Basil reveals that he has shown a secret of his soul in the portrait.

During a meeting between Dorian Gray, Basil Hallward, and Lord Henry Wotton, Lord Henry's charming and flirtatious nature intrigues Dorian. Despite Basil's request for Lord Henry to leave so he can finish painting, Dorian insists he stay. Lord Henry's words about self-development and the fear of society and God cause Dorian to question his beliefs and desires. This leads to a discussion about the importance of indulging in all desires and the potential consequences of suppressing them. The meeting concludes with Dorian finding peace in the garden, overwhelmed by his senses.

Lord Henry Wotton visits his uncle, Lord Fermor, and they discuss a young man named Dorian Gray. Lord Fermor recalls Dorian's mother, Lady Margaret Devereux, who caused a scandal by running away with a poor man and dying soon after. He also mentions Dorian's disliked grandfather, Lord Kelso. Lord Henry is fascinated by Dorian and his family's history, especially his mother's beauty and marriage. The text also explores the romantic pursuits of the wealthy and aristocratic society in London, including a woman who chooses to marry a poor man and an American woman who is pursued by an Englishman. Lord Henry is intrigued by Dorian's parentage and relationship with the painter Basil, and plans to manipulate and dominate him.
