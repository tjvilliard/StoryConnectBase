Starting a sci-fi story can be exciting and captivating for readers. Here are a few suggestions to begin your sci-fi story:

1. Create intrigue with a mysterious event: Begin with a puzzling incident or an unusual occurrence that captures the readers' attention. It could be a sudden power outage, a strange signal from outer space, or the appearance of a futuristic artifact. Use vivid and descriptive language to set the scene and build suspense.

Example: "On a quiet night in the small town of Crestwood, the sky erupted in a dazzling display of colors. An unidentified object streaked across the atmosphere, leaving a trail of shimmering stardust in its wake. As the townspeople stared up in awe, little did they know that this celestial spectacle was the harbinger of an extraordinary journey."

2. Introduce a compelling protagonist in an intriguing situation: Start by introducing your main character and depicting them in a situation that raises questions or generates curiosity. This could be a character with unique abilities, a strong-willed explorer setting off on a dangerous mission, or a scientist on the verge of a groundbreaking discovery.

Example: "Dr. Amelia Foster had always been drawn to the mysteries of the cosmos. As the renowned astrophysicist stood in front of the sleek, state-of-the-art telescope, she felt a surge of anticipation. Today, she was about to unveil a secret that would challenge everything humanity knew about the universe."

3. Begin with a dramatic or action-filled scene: Plunge your readers into the heart of the action from the very first sentence, immersing them in a thrilling event or intense conflict. This approach can instantly engage readers and keep them hooked from the start.

Example: "The war-torn cityscape glowed under a blood-red sky as Captain Alex Mercer, clad in a futuristic exosuit, navigated through the debris-covered streets. With every step, he could hear the distant whir of robotic drones and feel the weight of a civilization's hopes resting on his shoulders."

Remember, the beginning of your sci-fi story sets the stage for what's to come. It should capture the readers' attention, provide a glimpse into the world you've created, and ignite their curiosity, making them eager to delve further into your story.
