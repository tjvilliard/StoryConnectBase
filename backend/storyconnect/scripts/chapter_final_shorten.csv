78,2,Chapter 2,"['I--The twenty-fourth day of November 1690On a wintry morning at the close of 1690, the sun shining faint and redthrough a light fog, there was a great noise of baying dogs, loud voices,and trampling of horses in the courtyard at Wildairs Hall; Sir Jeoffrybeing about to go forth a-hunting, and being a man with a choleric temperand big, loud voice, and given to oaths and noise even when ingood-humour, his riding forth with his friends at any time was attendedwith boisterous commotion.  This morning it was more so than usual, forhe had guests with him who had come to his house the day before, and hadsupped late and drunk deeply, whereby the day found them, some withheadaches, some with a nausea at their stomachs, and some only in an evilhumour which made them curse at their horses when they were restless, andbreak into loud surly laughs when a coarse joke was made.  There weremany such jokes, Sir Jeoffry and his boon companions being renownedthroughout the county for the freedom of their conversation as for thescandal of their pastimes, and this day \'twas well indeed, as their loud-voiced, oath-besprinkled jests rang out on the cold air, that there wereno ladies about to ride forth with them.\'Twas Sir Jeoffry who was louder than any other, he having drunk evendeeper than the rest, and though \'twas his boast that he could carry abottle more than any man, and see all his guests under the table, hislast night\'s bout had left him in ill-humour and boisterous.  He strodeabout, casting oaths at the dogs and rating the servants, and when hemounted his big black horse \'twas amid such a clamour of voices andbaying hounds that the place was like Pandemonium.He was a large man of florid good looks, black eyes, and full habit ofbody, and had been much renowned in his youth for his great strength,which was indeed almost that of a giant, and for his deeds of prowess inthe saddle and at the table when the bottle went round.  There were manyevil stories of his roysterings, but it was not his way to think of themas evil, but rather to his credit as a man of the world, for, when heheard that they were gossiped about, he greeted the information with aloud triumphant laugh.  He had married, when she was fifteen, theblooming toast of the county, for whom his passion had long died out,having indeed departed with the honeymoon, which had been of thebriefest, and afterwards he having borne her a grudge for what he choseto consider her undutiful conduct.  This grudge was founded on the factthat, though she had presented him each year since their marriage with achild, after nine years had passed none had yet been sons, and, as he wasbitterly at odds with his next of kin, he considered each of hisoffspring an ill turn done him.He spent but little time in her society, for she was a poor, gentlecreature of no spirit, who found little happiness in her lot, since herlord treated her with scant civility, and her children one after anothersickened and died in their infancy until but two were left.  He scarceremembered her existence when he did not see her face, and he wascertainly not thinking of her this morning, having other things in view,and yet it so fell out that, while a groom was shortening a stirrup andbeing sworn at for his awkwardness, he by accident cast his eye upward toa chamber window peering out of the thick ivy on the stone.  Doing so hesaw an old woman draw back the curtain and look down upon him as ifsearching for him with a purpose.He uttered an exclamation of anger.""Damnation!  Mother Posset again,"" he said.  ""What does she there, oldfrump?""The curtain fell and the woman disappeared, but in a few minutes more anunheard-of thing happened--among the servants in the hall, the same oldwoman appeared making her way with a hurried fretfulness, and shedescended haltingly the stone steps and came to his side where he sat onhis black horse.""The Devil!"" he exclaimed--""what are you here for?  \'Tis not time foranother wench upstairs, surely?""""\'Tis not time,"" answered the old nurse acidly, taking her tone from hisown. ""But there is one, but an hour old, and my lady--""""Be damned to her!"" quoth Sir Jeoffry savagely.  ""A ninth one--and \'tisnine too many.  \'Tis more than man can bear.  She does it but to spiteme.""""\'Tis ill treatment for a gentleman who wants an heir,"" the old womananswered, as disrespectful of his spouse as he was, being a time-servingcrone, and knowing that it paid but poorly to coddle women who did not astheir husbands would have them in the way of offspring.  ""It should havebeen a fine boy, but it is not, and my lady--""""Damn her puling tricks!"" said Sir Jeoffry again, pulling at his horse\'sbit until the beast reared.""She would not let me rest until I came to you,"" said the nurseresentfully.  ""She would have you told that she felt strangely, andbefore you went forth would have a word with you.""""I cannot come, and am not in the mood for it if I could,"" was hisanswer.  ""What folly does she give way to?  This is the ninth time shehath felt strangely, and I have felt as squeamish as she--but nine ismore than I have patience for.""""She is light-headed, mayhap,"" said the nurse.  ""She lieth huddled in aheap, staring and muttering, and she would leave me no peace till Ipromised to say to you, \'For the sake of poor little Daphne, whom youwill sure remember.\'  She pinched my hand and said it again and again.""Sir Jeoffry dragged at his horse\'s mouth and swore again.""She was fifteen then, and had not given me nine yellow-faced wenches,""he said.  ""Tell her I had gone a-hunting and you were too late;"" and hestruck his big black beast with the whip, and it bounded away with him,hounds and huntsmen and fellow-roysterers galloping after, his guests,who had caught at the reason of his wrath, grinning as they rode.* * * * *In a huge chamber hung with tattered tapestries and barely set forth withcumbersome pieces of furnishing, my lady lay in a gloomy, canopied bed,with her new-born child at her side, but not looking at or touching it,seeming rather to have withdrawn herself from the pillow on which it layin its swaddling-clothes.She was but a little lady, and now, as she lay in the large bed, her faceand form shrunken and drawn with suffering, she looked scarce bigger thana child.  In the brief days of her happiness those who toasted her hadcalled her Titania for her fairy slightness and delicate beauty, but thenher fair wavy locks had been of a length that touched the ground when herwoman unbound them, and she had had the colour of a wild rose and theeyes of a tender little fawn.  Sir Jeoffry for a month or so had paidtempestuous court to her, and had so won her heart with his dashing wayof love-making and the daringness of his reputation, that she had thoughtherself--being child enough to think so--the luckiest young lady in theworld that his black eye should have fallen upon her with favour.  Eachyear since, with the bearing of each child, she had lost some of herbeauty.  With each one her lovely hair fell out still more, her wild-rosecolour faded, and her shape was spoiled.  She grew thin and yellow, onlya scant covering of the fair hair was left her, and her eyes were big andsunken.  Her marriage having displeased her family, and Sir Jeoffryhaving a distaste for the ceremonies of visiting and entertainment, savewhere his own cronies were concerned, she had no friends, and grewlonelier and lonelier as the sad years went by.  She being so withouthope and her life so dreary, her children were neither strong norbeautiful, and died quickly, each one bringing her only the anguish ofbirth and death.  This wintry morning her ninth lay slumbering by herside; the noise of baying dogs and boisterous men had died away with thelast sound of the horses\' hoofs; the little light which came into theroom through the ivied window was a faint yellowish red; she was cold,because the fire in the chimney was but a scant, failing one; she wasalone--and she knew that the time had come for her death.  This she knewfull well.She was alone, because, being so disrespected and deserted by her lord,and being of a timid and gentle nature, she could not command herinsufficient retinue of servants, and none served her as was their duty.The old woman Sir Jeoffry had dubbed Mother Posset had been her soleattendant at such times as these for the past five years, because shewould come to her for a less fee than a better woman, and Sir Jeoffry hadsworn he would not pay for wenches being brought into the world.  She wasa slovenly, guzzling old crone, who drank caudle from morning till night,and demanded good living as a support during the performance of hertrying duties; but these last she contrived to make wondrous light,knowing that there was none to reprove her.""A fine night I have had,"" she had grumbled when she brought back SirJeoffry\'s answer to her lady\'s message.  ""My old bones are like to break,and my back will not straighten itself.  I will go to the kitchen to getvictuals and somewhat to warm me; your ladyship\'s own woman shall sitwith you.""Her ladyship\'s ""own woman"" was also the sole attendant of the two littlegirls, Barbara and Anne, whose nursery was in another wing of the house,and my lady knew full well she would not come if she were told, and thatthere would be no message sent to her.She knew, too, that the fire was going out, but, though she shiveredunder the bed-clothes, she was too weak to call the woman back when shesaw her depart without putting fresh fuel upon it.So she lay alone, poor lady, and there was no sound about her, and herthin little mouth began to feebly quiver, and her great eyes, whichstared at the hangings, to fill with slow cold tears, for in sooth theywere not warm, but seemed to chill her poor cheeks as they rolled slowlydown them, leaving a wet streak behind them which she was too far gone inweakness to attempt to lift her hand to wipe away.""Nine times like this,"" she panted faintly, ""and \'tis for naught butoaths and hard words that blame me.  I was but a child myself and heloved me.  When \'twas \'My Daphne,\' and \'My beauteous little Daphne,\' heloved me in his own man\'s way.  But now--"" she faintly rolled her headfrom side to side.  ""Women are poor things""--a chill salt tear slidingpast her lips so that she tasted its bitterness--""only to be kissed foran hour, and then like this--only for this and nothing else.  I wouldthat this one had been dead.""Her breath came slower and more pantingly, and her eyes stared morewidely.""I was but a child,"" she whispered--""a child--as--as this will be--if shelives fifteen years.""Despite her weakness, and it was great and woefully increasing with eachpanting breath, she slowly laboured to turn herself towards the pillow onwhich her offspring lay, and, this done, she lay staring at the child andgasping, her thin chest rising and falling convulsively.  Ah, how shepanted, and how she stared, the glaze of death stealing slowly over herwide-opened eyes; and yet, dimming as they were, they saw in the sleepinginfant a strange and troublous thing--though it was but a few hours old\'twas not as red and crumple visaged as new-born infants usually are, itslittle head was covered with thick black silk, and its small featureswere of singular definiteness.  She dragged herself nearer to gaze.""She looks not like the others,"" she said.  ""They had no beauty--and aresafe.  She--she will be like--Jeoffry--and like _me_.""The dying fire fell lower with a shuddering sound.""If she is--beautiful, and has but her father, and no mother!"" shewhispered, the words dragged forth slowly, ""only evil can come to her.From her first hour--she will know naught else, poor heart, poor heart!""There was a rattling in her throat as she breathed, but in her glazingeyes a gleam like passion leaped, and gasping, she dragged nearer.""\'Tis not fair,"" she cried.  ""If I--if I could lay my hand upon thymouth--and stop thy breathing--thou poor thing, \'twould be fairer--but--Ihave no strength.""She gathered all her dying will and brought her hand up to the infant\'smouth.  A wild look was on her poor, small face, she panted and fellforward on its breast, the rattle in her throat growing louder.  Thechild awakened, opening great black eyes, and with her dying weakness itsnew-born life struggled.  Her cold hand lay upon its mouth, and herhead upon its body, for she was too far gone to move if she had willed todo so.  But the tiny creature\'s strength was marvellous.  It gasped, itfought, its little limbs struggled beneath her, it writhed until the coldhand fell away, and then, its baby mouth set free, it fell a-shrieking.Its cries were not like those of a new-born thing, but fierce and shrill,and even held the sound of infant passion.  \'Twas not a thing to let itslife go easily, \'twas of those born to do battle.Its lusty screaming pierced her ear perhaps--she drew a long, slowbreath, and then another, and another still--the last one trembled andstopped short, and the last cinder fell dead from the fire.* * * * *When the nurse came bustling and fretting back, the chamber was cold asthe grave\'s self--there were only dead embers on the hearth, the new-bornchild\'s cries filled all the desolate air, and my lady was lying stonedead, her poor head resting on her offspring\'s feet, the while her openglazed eyes seemed to stare at it as if in asking Fate some awfulquestion.']"
78,3,Chapter 3,"['II--In which Sir Jeoffry encounters his offspringIn a remote wing of the house, in barren, ill-kept rooms, the poorinfants of the dead lady had struggled through their brief lives, andgiven them up, one after the other.  Sir Jeoffry had not wished to seethem, nor had he done so, but upon the rarest occasions, and then nearlyalways by some untoward accident.  The six who had died, even theirmother had scarcely wept for; her weeping had been that they should havebeen fated to come into the world, and when they went out of it she knewshe need not mourn their going as untimely.  The two who had notperished, she had regarded sadly day by day, seeing they had no beautyand that their faces promised none.  Naught but great beauty would haveexcused their existence in their father\'s eyes, as beauty might havehelped them to good matches which would have rid him of them.  But \'twasthe sad ill fortune of the children Anne and Barbara to have been treatedby Nature in a way but niggardly.  They were pale young misses, withinsignificant faces and snub noses, resembling an aunt who died aspinster, as they themselves seemed most likely to.  Sir Jeoffry couldnot bear the sight of them, and they fled at the sound of his footsteps,if it so happened that by chance they heard it, huddling together incorners, and slinking behind doors or anything big enough to hide them.They had no playthings and no companions and no pleasures but such as theinnocent invention of childhood contrives for itself.After their mother\'s death a youth desolate and strange indeed lay beforethem.  A spinster who was a poor relation was the only person ofrespectable breeding who ever came near them.  To save herself fromgenteel starvation, she had offered herself for the place of governess tothem, though she was fitted for the position neither by education norcharacter.  Mistress Margery Wimpole was a poor, dull creature, having nowilful harm in her, but endowed with neither dignity nor wit.  She livedin fear of Sir Jeoffry, and in fear of the servants, who knew full wellthat she was an humble dependant, and treated her as one.  She hid awaywith her pupils in the bare school-room in the west wing, and taughtthem to spell and write and work samplers.  She herself knew no more.The child who had cost her mother her life had no happier prospect thanher sisters.  Her father felt her more an intruder than they had been, hebeing of the mind that to house and feed and clothe, howsoever poorly,these three burdens on him was a drain scarcely to be borne.  His wifehad been a toast and not a fortune, and his estate not being great, hepossessed no more than his drinking, roystering, and gambling made fulldemands upon.The child was baptized Clorinda, and bred, so to speak, from her firsthour, in the garret and the servants\' hall.  Once only did her fatherbehold her during her infancy, which event was a mere accident, as he hadexpressed no wish to see her, and only came upon her in the nurse\'s armssome weeks after her mother\'s death.  \'Twas quite by chance.  The woman,who was young and buxom, had begun an intrigue with a groom, and having amind to see him, was crossing the stable-yard, carrying her charge withher, when Sir Jeoffry came by to visit a horse.The woman came plump upon him, entering a stable as he came out of it;she gave a frightened start, and almost let the child drop, at which itset up a strong, shrill cry, and thus Sir Jeoffry saw it, and seeing it,was thrown at once into a passion which expressed itself after the mannerof all his emotion, and left the nurse quaking with fear.""Thunder and damnation!"" he exclaimed, as he strode away after theencounter; ""\'tis the ugliest yet.  A yellow-faced girl brat, with eyeslike an owl\'s in an ivy-bush, and with a voice like a very peacocks.Another mawking, plain slut that no man will take off my hands.""He did not see her again for six years.  But little wit was needed tolearn that \'twas best to keep her out of his sight, as her sisters werekept, and this was done without difficulty, as he avoided the wing of thehouse where the children lived, as if it were stricken with the plague.But the child Clorinda, it seemed, was of lustier stock than her oldersisters, and this those about her soon found out to their grievousdisturbance.  When Mother Posset had drawn her from under her deadmother\'s body she had not left shrieking for an hour, but had kept up herfierce cries until the roof rang with them, and the old woman had joggedher about and beat her back in the hopes of stifling her, until she wasexhausted and dismayed.  For the child would not be stilled, and seemedto have such strength and persistence in her as surely infant nevershowed before.""Never saw I such a brat among all I have brought into the world,"" oldPosset quavered.  ""She hath the voice of a six-months boy.  It cracks myvery ears.  Hush thee, then, thou little wild cat.""This was but the beginning.  From the first she grew apace, and in a fewmonths was a bouncing infant, with a strong back, and a power to makeherself heard such as had not before appeared in the family.  When shedesired a thing, she yelled and roared with such a vigour as left nopeace for any creature about her until she was humoured, and this beingthe case, rather than have their conversation and love-making put a stopto, the servants gave her her way.  In this they but followed the exampleof their betters, of whom we know that it is not to the most virtuousthey submit or to the most learned, but to those who, being crossed, canconduct themselves in a manner so disagreeable, shrewish or violent, thatlife is a burden until they have their will.  This the child Clorinda hadthe infant wit to discover early, and having once discovered it, shenever ceased to take advantage of her knowledge.  Having found in thedays when her one desire was pap, that she had but to roar lustily enoughto find it beside her in her porringer, she tried the game upon all otheroccasions.  When she had reached but a twelvemonth, she stood stoutlyupon her little feet, and beat her sisters to gain their playthings, andher nurse for wanting to change her smock.  She was so easily thrown intofuries, and so raged and stamped in her baby way that she was a sight tobehold, and the men-servants found amusement in badgering her.  To setMistress Clorinda in their midst on a winter\'s night when they were dull,and to torment her until her little face grew scarlet with the bloodwhich flew up into it, and she ran from one to the other beating them andscreaming like a young spitfire, was among them a favouriteentertainment.""Ifackens!"" said the butler one night, ""but she is as like Sir Jeoffry inher temper as one pea is like another.  Ay, but she grows blood red justas he does, and curses in her little way as he does in man\'s words amonghis hounds in their kennel.""""And she will be of his build, too,"" said the housekeeper.  ""What mishapchanged her to a maid instead of a boy, I know not.  She would have madea strapping heir.  She has the thigh and shoulders of a handsomeman-child at this hour, and she is not three years old.""""Sir Jeoffry missed his mark when he called her an ugly brat,"" said thewoman who had nursed her.  ""She will be a handsome woman--though large inbuild, it may be.  She will be a brown beauty, but she will have a colourin her cheeks and lips like the red of Christmas holly, and her owl\'seyes are as black as sloes, and have fringes on them like the curtains ofa window.  See how her hair grows thick on her little head, and how itcurls in great rings.  My lady, her poor mother, was once a beauty, butshe was no such beauty as this one will be, for she has her father\'s longlimbs and fine shoulders, and the will to make every man look her way.""""Yes,"" said the housekeeper, who was an elderly woman, ""there will bedoings--there will be doings when she is a ripe young maid.  She willtake her way, and God grant she mayn\'t be _too_ like her father andfollow his.""It was true that she had no resemblance to her plain sisters, and bore nolikeness to them in character.  The two elder children, Anne and Barbara,were too meek-spirited to be troublesome; but during Clorinda\'s infancyMistress Margery Wimpole watched her rapid growth with fear and qualms.She dare not reprove the servants who were ruining her by theirtreatment, and whose manners were forming her own.  Sir Jeoffry\'sservants were no more moral than their master, and being brought up asshe was among them, their young mistress became strangely familiar withmany sights and sounds it is not the fortune of most young misses ofbreeding to see and hear.  The cooks and kitchen-wenches were flightywith the grooms and men-servants, and little Mistress Clorinda, having apassion for horses and dogs, spent many an hour in the stables with thewomen who, for reasons of their own, were pleased enough to take herthere as an excuse for seeking amusement for themselves.  She played inthe kennels and among the horses\' heels, and learned to use oaths asroundly as any Giles or Tom whose work was to wield the curry comb.  Itwas indeed a curious thing to hear her red baby mouth pour forth cursesand unseemly words as she would at any one who crossed her.  Her temperand hot-headedness carried all before them, and the grooms and stable-boys found great sport in the language my young lady used in her innocentfuries.  But balk her in a whim, and she would pour forth the eloquenceof a fish-wife or a lady of easy virtue in a pot-house quarrel.  Therewas no human creature near her who had mind or heart enough to see theawfulness of her condition, or to strive to teach her to check herpassions; and in the midst of these perilous surroundings the littlevirago grew handsomer and of finer carriage every hour, as if on the rankdiet that fed her she throve and flourished.There came a day at last when she had reached six years old, when by atrick of chance a turn was given to the wheel of her fate.She had not reached three when a groom first set her on a horse\'s backand led her about the stable-yard, and she had so delighted in herexalted position, and had so shouted for pleasure and clutched hersteed\'s rein and clucked at him, that her audience had looked on withroars of laughter.  From that time she would be put up every day, and astime went on showed such unchildish courage and spirit that she furnishedto her servant companions a new pastime.  Soon she would not be held on,but riding astride like a boy, would sit up as straight as a man andswear at her horse, beating him with her heels and little fists if hispace did not suit her.  She knew no fear, and would have used a whip soreadily that the men did not dare to trust her with one, and knew theymust not mount her on a steed too mettlesome.  By the time she passed hersixth birthday she could ride as well as a grown man, and was as familiarwith her father\'s horses as he himself, though he knew nothing of thematter, it being always contrived that she should be out of sight when hevisited his hunters.It so chanced that the horse he rode the oftenest was her favourite, andmany were the tempests of rage she fell into when she went to the stableto play with the animal and did not find him in his stall, because hismaster had ordered him out.  At such times she would storm at the men inthe stable-yard and call them ill names for their impudence in lettingthe beast go, which would cause them great merriment, as she knew nothingof who the man was who had balked her, since she was, in truth, not somuch as conscious of her father\'s existence, never having seen or evenheard more of him than his name, which she in no manner connected withherself.""Could Sir Jeoffry himself but once see and hear her when she storms atus and him, because he dares to ride his own beast,"" one of the older mensaid once, in the midst of their laughter, ""I swear he would burst forthlaughing and be taken with her impudent spirit, her temper is so like hisown.  She is his own flesh and blood, and as full of hell-fire as he.""Upon this morning which proved eventful to her, she had gone to thestables, as was her daily custom, and going into the stall where the bigblack horse was wont to stand, she found it empty.  Her spirit rose hotwithin her in the moment.  She clenched her fists, and began to stamp andswear in such a manner as it would be scarce fitting to record.""Where is he now?"" she cried.  ""He is my own horse, and shall not beridden.  Who is the man who takes him?  Who?  Who?""""\'Tis a fellow who hath no manners,"" said the man she stormed at,grinning and thrusting his tongue in his cheek.  ""He says \'tis his beast,and not yours, and he will have him when he chooses.""""\'Tis not his--\'tis mine!"" shrieked Miss, her little face inflamed withpassion.  ""I will kill him!  \'Tis my horse.  He _shall_ be mine!""For a while the men tormented her, to hear her rave and see her passion,for, in truth, the greater tempest she was in, the better she was worthbeholding, having a colour so rich, and eyes so great and black andflaming.  At such times there was naught of the feminine in her, andindeed always she looked more like a handsome boy than a girl, her growthbeing for her age extraordinary.  At length a lad who was a helper saidto mock her--""The man hath him at the door before the great steps now.  I saw himstand there waiting but a moment ago.  The man hath gone in the house.""She turned and ran to find him.  The front part of the house she barelyknew the outside of, as she was kept safely in the west wing and belowstairs, and when taken out for the air was always led privately by a sideway--never passing through the great hall, where her father might chanceto encounter her.She knew best this side-entrance, and made her way to it, meaning tosearch until she found the front.  She got into the house, and her spiritbeing roused, marched boldly through corridors and into rooms she hadnever seen before, and being so mere a child, notwithstanding her strangewilfulness and daring, the novelty of the things she saw so fardistracted her mind from the cause of her anger that she stopped morethan once to stare up at a portrait on a wall, or to take in her handsomething she was curious concerning.When she at last reached the entrance-hall, coming into it through a doorshe pushed open, using all her childish strength, she stood in the midstof it and gazed about her with a new curiosity and pleasure.  It was afine place, with antlers, and arms, and foxes\' brushes hung upon thewalls, and with carved panels of black oak, and oaken floor andfurnishings.  All in it was disorderly and showed rough usage; but onceit had been a notable feature of the house, and well worth better carethan had been bestowed upon it.  She discovered on the walls manytrophies that attracted her, but these she could not reach, and couldonly gaze and wonder at; but on an old oaken settle she found some thingsshe could lay hands on, and forthwith seized and sat down upon the floorto play with them.  One of them was a hunting-crop, which she brandishedgrandly, until she was more taken with a powder-flask which it sohappened her father, Sir Jeoffry, had lain down but a few minutes before,in passing through.  He was going forth coursing, and had stepped intothe dining-hall to toss off a bumper of brandy.When he had helped himself from the buffet, and came back in haste, thefirst thing he clapped eyes on was his offspring pouring forth the powderfrom his flask upon the oaken floor.  He had never seen her since thatfirst occasion after the unfortunate incident of her birth, and beholdinga child wasting his good powder at the moment he most wanted it and hadno time to spare, and also not having had it recalled to his mind foryears that he was a parent, except when he found himself forcedreluctantly to pay for some small need, he beheld in the young offenderonly some impudent servant\'s brat, who had strayed into his domain andapplied itself at once to mischief.He sprang upon her, and seizing her by the arm, whirled her to her feetwith no little violence, snatching the powder-flask from her, and dealingher a sound box on the ear.""Blood and damnation on thee, thou impudent little baggage!"" he shouted.""I\'ll break thy neck for thee, little scurvy beast;"" and pulled the bellas he were like to break the wire.But he had reckoned falsely on what he dealt with.  Miss uttered a shriekof rage which rang through the roof like a clarion.  She snatched thecrop from the floor, rushed at him, and fell upon him like a thousandlittle devils, beating his big legs with all the strength of her passion,and pouring forth oaths such as would have done credit to Doll Lightfootherself.""Damn _thee_!--damn _thee_!""--she roared and screamed, flogging him.""I\'ll tear thy eyes out!  I\'ll cut thy liver from thee!  Damn thy soul tohell!""And this choice volley was with such spirit and fury poured forth, thatSir Jeoffry let his hand drop from the bell, fell into a great burst oflaughter, and stood thus roaring while she beat him and shrieked andstormed.The servants, hearing the jangled bell, attracted by the tumult, and of asudden missing Mistress Clorinda, ran in consternation to the hall, andthere beheld this truly pretty sight--Miss beating her father\'s legs, andtearing at him tooth and nail, while he stood shouting with laughter asif he would split his sides.""Who is the little cockatrice?"" he cried, the tears streaming down hisflorid cheeks.  ""Who is the young she-devil?  Ods bodikins, who is she?""For a second or so the servants stared at each other aghast, not knowingwhat to say, or venturing to utter a word; and then the nurse, who hadcome up panting, dared to gasp forth the truth.""\'Tis Mistress Clorinda, Sir Jeoffry,"" she stammered--""my lady\'s lastinfant--the one of whom she died in childbed.""His big laugh broke in two, as one might say.  He looked down at theyoung fury and stared.  She was out of breath with beating him, and hadceased and fallen back apace, and was staring up at him also, breathingdefiance and hatred.  Her big black eyes were flames, her head was thrownup and back, her cheeks were blood scarlet, and her great crop of crow-black hair stood out about her beauteous, wicked little virago face, asif it might change into Medusa\'s snakes.""Damn thee!"" she shrieked at him again.  ""I\'ll kill thee, devil!""Sir Jeoffry broke into his big laugh afresh.""Clorinda do they call thee, wench?"" he said.  ""Jeoffry thou shouldsthave been but for thy mother\'s folly.  A fiercer little devil for thysize I never saw--nor a handsomer one.""And he seized her from where she stood, and held her at his big arms\'length, gazing at her uncanny beauty with looks that took her in fromhead to foot.']"
78,4,Chapter 4,"['III--Wherein Sir Jeoffry\'s boon companions drink a toastHer beauty of face, her fine body, her strength of limb, and great growthfor her age, would have pleased him if she had possessed no otherattraction, but the daring of her fury and her stable-boy breeding soamused him and suited his roystering tastes that he took to her as thefinest plaything in the world.He set her on the floor, forgetting his coursing, and would have madefriends with her, but at first she would have none of him, and scowled athim in spite of all he did.  The brandy by this time had mounted to hishead and put him in the mood for frolic, liquor oftenest making himgamesome.  He felt as if he were playing with a young dog or marking thespirit of a little fighting cock.  He ordered the servants back to theirkitchen, who stole away, the women amazed, and the men concealing grinswhich burst forth into guffaws of laughter when they came into their hallbelow.""\'Tis as we said,"" they chuckled.  ""He had but to see her beauty and findher a bigger devil than he, and \'twas done.  The mettle of her--damningand flogging him!  Never was there a finer sight!  She feared him no morethan if he had been a spaniel--and he roaring and laughing till he waslike to burst.""""Dost know who I am?"" Sir Jeoffry was asking the child, grinning himselfas he stood before her where she sat on the oaken settle on which he hadlifted her.""No,"" quoth little Mistress, her black brows drawn down, her handsomeowl\'s eyes verily seeming to look him through and through in search ofsomewhat; for, in sooth, her rage abating before his jovial humour, thebig burly laugher attracted her attention, though she was not disposed toshow him that she leaned towards any favour or yielding.""I am thy Dad,"" he said.  ""\'Twas thy Dad thou gavest such a trouncing.And thou hast an arm, too.  Let\'s cast an eye on it.""He took her wrist and pushed up her sleeve, but she dragged back.""Will not be mauled,"" she cried.  ""Get away from me!""He shouted with laughter again.  He had seen that the little arm was aswhite and hard as marble, and had such muscles as a great boy might havebeen a braggart about.""By Gad!"" he said, elated.  ""What a wench of six years old.  Wilt have mycrop and trounce thy Dad again!""He picked up the crop from the place where she had thrown it, andforthwith gave it in her hand.  She took it, but was no more in thehumour to beat him, and as she looked still frowning from him to thewhip, the latter brought back to her mind the horse she had set out insearch of.""Where is my horse?"" she said, and \'twas in the tone of an imperialdemand.  ""Where is he?""""Thy horse!"" he echoed.  ""Which is thy horse then?""""Rake is my horse,"" she answered--""the big black one.  The man took himagain;"" and she ripped out a few more oaths and unchaste expressions,threatening what she would do for the man in question; the whichdelighted him more than ever.  ""Rake is my horse,"" she ended.  ""None elseshall ride him.""""None else?"" cried he.  ""Thou canst not ride him, baggage!""She looked at him with scornful majesty.""Where is he?"" she demanded.  And the next instant hearing the beast\'srestless feet grinding into the gravel outside as he fretted at havingbeen kept waiting so long, she remembered what the stable-boy had said ofhaving seen her favourite standing before the door, and struggling anddropping from the settle, she ran to look out; whereupon having done so,she shouted in triumph.""He is here!"" she said.  ""I see him;"" and went pell-mell down the stonesteps to his side.Sir Jeoffry followed her in haste.  \'Twould not have been to his humournow to have her brains kicked out.""Hey!"" he called, as he hurried.  ""Keep away from his heels, thou littledevil.""But she had run to the big beast\'s head with another shout, and caughthim round his foreleg, laughing, and Rake bent his head down and nosedher in a fumbling caress, on which, the bridle coming within her reach,she seized it and held his head that she might pat him, to whichfamiliarity the beast was plainly well accustomed.""He is my horse,"" quoth she grandly when her father reached her.  ""Hewill not let Giles play so.""Sir Jeoffry gazed and swelled with pleasure in her.""Would have said \'twas a lie if I had not seen it,"" he said to himself.""\'Tis no girl this, I swear.  I thought \'twas my horse,"" he said to her,""but \'tis plain enough he is thine.""""Put me up!"" said his new-found offspring.""Hast rid him before?"" Sir Jeoffry asked, with some lingering misgiving.""Tell thy Dad if thou hast rid him.""She gave him a look askance under her long fringed lids--a surly yet half-slyly relenting look, because she wanted to get her way of him, and hadthe cunning wit and shrewdness of a child witch.""Ay!"" quoth she.  ""Put me up--Dad!""He was not a man of quick mind, his brain having been too many yearsbemuddled with drink, but he had a rough instinct which showed him allthe wondrous shrewdness of her casting that last word at him to wheedlehim, even though she looked sullen in the saying it.  It made him roaragain for very exultation.""Put me up, Dad!"" he cried.  ""That will I--and see what thou wilt do.""He lifted her, she springing as he set his hands beneath her arms, andflinging her legs over astride across the saddle when she reached it.  Shewas all fire and excitement, and caught the reins like an old huntsman,and with such a grasp as was amazing.  She sat up with a straight, strongback, her whole face glowing and sparkling with exultant joy.  Rakeseemed to answer to her excited little laugh almost as much as to herhand.  It seemed to wake his spirit and put him in good-humour.  Hestarted off with her down the avenue at a light, spirited trot, whileshe, clinging with her little legs and sitting firm and fearless, madehim change into canter and gallop, having actually learned all his paceslike a lesson, and knowing his mouth as did his groom, who was herfamiliar and slave.  Had she been of the build ordinary with children ofher age, she could not have stayed upon his back; but she sat him like achild jockey, and Sir Jeoffry, watching and following her, clapped hishands boisterously and hallooed for joy.""Lord, Lord!"" he said.  ""There\'s not a man in the shire has such anotherlittle devil--and Rake, \'her horse,\'"" grinning--""and she to ride him so.I love thee, wench--hang me if I do not!""She made him play with her and with Rake for a good hour, and then tookhim back to the stables, and there ordered him about finely among thedogs and horses, perceiving that somehow this great man she had got holdof was a creature who was in power and could be made use of.When they returned to the house, he had her to eat her mid-day meal withhim, when she called for ale, and drank it, and did good trencher duty,making him the while roar with laughter at her impudent child-talk.""Never have I so split my sides since I was twenty,"" he said.  ""It makesme young again to roar so.  She shall not leave my sight, since by chanceI have found her.  \'Tis too good a joke to lose, when times are dull, asthey get to be as a man\'s years go on.""He sent for her woman and laid strange new commands on her.""Where hath she hitherto been kept?"" he asked.""In the west wing, where are the nurseries, and where Mistress Wimpoleabides with Mistress Barbara and Mistress Anne,"" the woman answered, witha frightened curtsey.""Henceforth she shall live in this part of the house where I do,"" hesaid.  ""Make ready the chambers that were my lady\'s, and prepare to staythere with her.""From that hour the child\'s fate was sealed.  He made himself herplayfellow, and romped with and indulged her until she became fonder ofhim than of any groom or stable-boy she had been companions with before.But, indeed, she had never been given to bestowing much affection onthose around her, seeming to feel herself too high a personage to showsoftness.  The ones she showed most favour to were those who served herbest; and even to them it was always _favour_ she showed, not tenderness.Certain dogs and horses she was fond of, Rake coming nearest to herheart, and the place her father won in her affections was somewhat liketo Rake\'s.  She made him her servant and tyrannised over him, but at thesame time followed and imitated him as if she had been a young spaniel hewas training.  The life the child led, it would have broken a motherlywoman\'s heart to hear about; but there was no good woman near her, hermother\'s relatives, and even Sir Jeoffry\'s own, having cut themselves offearly from them--Wildairs Hall and its master being no great credit tothose having the misfortune to be connected with them.  The neighbouringgentry had gradually ceased to visit the family some time before herladyship\'s death, and since then the only guests who frequented the placewere a circle of hunting, drinking, and guzzling boon companions of SirJeoffry\'s own, who joined him in all his carousals and debaucheries.To these he announced his discovery of his daughter with tumultuousdelight.  He told them, amid storms of laughter, of his first encounterwith her; of her flogging him with his own crop, and cursing him like atrooper; of her claiming Rake as her own horse, and swearing at the manwho had dared to take him from the stable to ride; and of her sitting himlike an infant jockey, and seeming, by some strange power, to havemastered him as no other had been able heretofore to do.  Then he had herbrought into the dining-room, where they sat over their bottles drinkingdeep, and setting her on the table, he exhibited her to them, boasting ofher beauty, showing them her splendid arm and leg and thigh, measuringher height, and exciting her to test the strength of the grip of her handand the power of her little fist.""Saw you ever a wench like her?"" he cried, as they all shouted withlaughter and made jokes not too polite, but such as were of the sole kindthey were given to.  ""Has any man among you begot a boy as big andhandsome?  Hang me! if she would not knock down any lad of ten if shewere in a fury.""""We wild dogs are out of favour with the women,"" cried one of the bestpleased among them, a certain Lord Eldershawe, whose seat was a few milesfrom Wildairs Hall--""women like nincompoops and chaplains.  Let us takethis one for our toast, and bring her up as girls should be brought up tobe companions for men.  I give you, Mistress Clorinda Wildairs--MistressClorinda, the enslaver of six years old--bumpers, lads!--bumpers!""And they set her in the very midst of the big table and drank her health,standing, bursting into a jovial, ribald song; and the child, excited bythe noise and laughter, actually broke forth and joined them in a high,strong treble, the song being one she was quite familiar with, havingheard it often enough in the stable to have learned the words pat.* * * * *Two weeks after his meeting with her, Sir Jeoffry was seized with thewhim to go up to London and set her forth with finery.  \'Twas but rarelyhe went up to town, having neither money to waste, nor finding greatattraction in the more civilised quarters of the world.  He brought herback such clothes as for richness and odd, unsuitable fashion child neverwore before.  There were brocades that stood alone with splendour offabric, there was rich lace, fine linen, ribbands, farthingales,swansdown tippets, and little slippers with high red heels.  He had awardrobe made for her such as the finest lady of fashion could scarcelyboast, and the tiny creature was decked out in it, and on great occasionseven strung with her dead mother\'s jewels.Among these strange things, he had the fantastical notion to have madefor her several suits of boy\'s clothes: pink and blue satin coats, littlewhite, or amber, or blue satin breeches, ruffles of lace, and waistcoatsembroidered with colours and silver or gold.  There was also a smallscarlet-coated hunting costume and all the paraphernalia of the chase.  Itwas Sir Jeoffry\'s finest joke to bid her woman dress her as a boy, andthen he would have her brought to the table where he and his fellows weredining together, and she would toss off her little bumper with the bestof them, and rip out childish oaths, and sing them, to their delight,songs she had learned from the stable-boys.  She cared more for dogs andhorses than for finery, and when she was not in the humour to be made apuppet of, neither tirewoman nor devil could put her into her brocades;but she liked the excitement of the dining-room, and, as time went on,would be dressed in her flowered petticoats in a passion of eagerness togo and show herself, and coquet in her lace and gewgaws with men oldenough to be her father, and loose enough to find her premature airs andgraces a fine joke indeed.  She ruled them all with her temper and hershrewish will.  She would have her way in all things, or there should beno sport with her, and she would sing no songs for them, but would floutthem bitterly, and sit in a great chair with her black brows drawn down,and her whole small person breathing rancour and disdain.Sir Jeoffry, who had bullied his wife, had now the pleasurable experienceof being henpecked by his daughter; for so, indeed, he was.  Miss ruledhim with a rod of iron, and wielded her weapon with such skill thatbefore a year had elapsed he obeyed her as the servants below stairs haddone in her infancy.  She had no fear of his great oaths, for shepossessed a strangely varied stock of her own upon which she could alwaysdraw, and her voice being more shrill than his, if not of such bigness,her ear-piercing shrieks and indomitable perseverance always proved toomuch for him in the end.  It must be admitted likewise that her violenceof temper and power of will were somewhat beyond his own, notwithstandingher tender years and his reputation.  In fact, he found himself obligedto observe this, and finally made something of a merit and joke of it.""There is no managing of the little shrew,"" he would say.  ""Neither mannor devil can bend or break her.  If I smashed every bone in her carcass,she would die shrieking hell at me and defiance.""If one admits the truth, it must be owned that if she had not hadbestowed upon her by nature gifts of beauty and vivacity soextraordinary, and had been cursed with a thousandth part of thevixenishness she displayed every day of her life, he would have brokenevery bone in her carcass without a scruple or a qualm.  But her beautyseemed but to grow with every hour that passed, and it was by exceedinggood fortune exactly the fashion of beauty which he admired the most.When she attained her tenth year she was as tall as a fine boy of twelve,and of such a shape and carriage as young Diana herself might haveenvied.  Her limbs were long, and most divinely moulded, and of astrength that caused admiration and amazement in all beholders.  Herfather taught her to follow him in the hunting-field, and when sheappeared upon her horse, clad in her little breeches and top-boots andscarlet coat, child though she was, she set the field on fire.  Shelearned full early how to coquet and roll her fine eyes; but it is alsotrue that she was not much of a languisher, as all her ogling was of adestructive or proudly-attacking kind.  It was her habit to leave othersto languish, and herself to lead them with disdainful vivacity to doingso.  She was the talk, and, it must be admitted, the scandal, of thecounty by the day she was fifteen.  The part wherein she lived was aboisterous hunting shire where there were wide ditches and high hedges toleap, and rough hills and moors to gallop over, and within the regionneither polite life nor polite education were much thought of; but evenin the worst portions of it there were occasional virtuous matrons whoshook their heads with much gravity and wonder over the beautifulMistress Clorinda.']"
78,5,Chapter 5,"['IV--Lord Twemlow\'s chaplain visits his patron\'s kinsman, andMistress Clorinda shines on her birthday nightUncivilised and almost savage as her girlish life was, and unregulated byany outward training as was her mind, there were none who came in contactwith her who could be blind to a certain strong, clear wit, andunconquerableness of purpose, for which she was remarkable.  She everknew full well what she desired to gain or to avoid, and once havingfixed her mind upon any object, she showed an adroitness and brilliancyof resource, a control of herself and others, the which there was nocircumventing.  She never made a blunder because she could not controlthe expression of her emotions; and when she gave way to a passion, \'twasbecause she chose to do so, having naught to lose, and in the midst ofall their riotous jesting with her the boon companions of Sir Jeoffryknew this.""Had she a secret to keep, child though she is,"" said Eldershawe, ""thereis none--man or woman--who could scare or surprise it from her; and \'tisa strange quality to note so early in a female creature.""She spent her days with her father and his dissolute friends, treatedhalf like a boy, half a fantastical queen, until she was fourteen.  Shehunted and coursed, shot birds, leaped hedges and ditches, reigned at theriotous feastings, and coquetted with these mature, and in some caseselderly, men, as if she looked forward to doing naught else all her life.But one day, after she had gone out hunting with her father, riding Rake,who had been given to her, and wearing her scarlet coat, breeches, andtop-boots, one of the few remaining members of her mother\'s family senthis chaplain to remonstrate and advise her father to command her toforbear from appearing in such impudent attire.There was, indeed, a stirring scene when this message was delivered byits bearer.  The chaplain was an awkward, timid creature, who had heardstories enough of Wildairs Hall and its master to undertake his missionwith a quaking soul.  To have refused to obey any behest of his patronwould have cost him his living, and knowing this beyond a doubt, he wasforced to gird up his loins and gather together all the little courage hecould muster to beard the lion in his den.The first thing he beheld on entering the big hall was a beautiful tallyouth wearing his own rich black hair, and dressed in scarlet coat forhunting.  He was playing with a dog, making it leap over his crop, andboth laughing and swearing at its clumsiness.  He glanced at the chaplainwith a laughing, brilliant eye, returning the poor man\'s humble bow witha slight nod as he plainly hearkened to what he said as he explained hiserrand.""I come from my Lord Twemlow, who is your master\'s kinsman,"" the chaplainfaltered; ""I am bidden to see and speak to him if it be possible, and hislordship much desires that Sir Jeoffry will allow it to be so.  My LordTwemlow--""The beautiful youth left his playing with the dog and came forward withall the air of the young master of the house.""My Lord Twemlow sends you?"" he said.  ""\'Tis long since his lordshipfavoured us with messages.  Where is Sir Jeoffry, Lovatt?""""In the dining-hall,"" answered the servant.  ""He went there but a momentpast, Mistress.""The chaplain gave such a start as made him drop his shovel hat.""Mistress!""  And this was she--this fine young creature who was tall andgrandly enough built and knit to seem a radiant being even when clad inmasculine attire.  He picked up his hat and bowed so low that it almostswept the floor in his obeisance.  He was not used to female beauty whichdeigned to cast great smiling eyes upon him, for at my Lord Twemlow\'stable he sat so far below the salt that women looked not his way.This beauty looked at him as if she was amused at the thought ofsomething in her own mind.  He wondered tremblingly if she guessed whathe came for and knew how her father would receive it.""Come with me,"" she said; ""I will take you to him.  He would not see youif I did not.  He does not love his lordship tenderly enough.""She led the way, holding her head jauntily and high, while he cast downhis eyes lest his gaze should be led to wander in a way unseemly in oneof his cloth.  Such a foot and such--!  He felt it more becoming andsafer to lift his eyes to the ceiling and keep them there, which gave himsomewhat the aspect of one praying.Sir Jeoffry stood at the buffet with a flagon of ale in his hand, takinghis stirrup cup.  At the sight of a stranger and one attired in the garbof a chaplain, he scowled surprisedly.""What\'s this?"" quoth he.  ""What dost want, Clo?  I have no leisure for asermon.""Mistress Clorinda went to the buffet and filled a tankard for herself andcarried it back to the table, on the edge of which she half sat, with oneleg bent, one foot resting on the floor.""Time thou wilt have to take, Dad,"" she said, with an arch grin, showingtwo rows of gleaming pearls.  ""This gentleman is my Lord Twemlow\'schaplain, whom he sends to exhort you, requesting you to have thecivility to hear him.""""Exhort be damned, and Twemlow be damned too!"" cried Sir Jeoffry, who hada great quarrel with his lordship and hated him bitterly.  ""What does thecanting fool mean?""""Sir,"" faltered the poor message-bearer, ""his lordship hath--hath beenconcerned--having heard--""The handsome creature balanced against the table took the tankard fromher lips and laughed.""Having heard thy daughter rides to field in breeches, and is an unseemly-behaving wench,"" she cried, ""his lordship sends his chaplain to deliver adiscourse thereon--not choosing to come himself.  Is not that thy errand,reverend sir?""The chaplain, poor man, turned pale, having caught, as she spoke, aglimpse of Sir Jeoffry\'s reddening visage.""Madam,"" he faltered, bowing--""Madam, I ask pardon of you most humbly!  Ifit were your pleasure to deign to--to--allow me--""She set the tankard on the table with a rollicking smack, and thrust herhands in her breeches-pockets, swaying with laughter; and, indeed, \'twasringing music, her rich great laugh, which, when she grew of riper years,was much lauded and written verses on by her numerous swains.""If \'twere my pleasure to go away and allow you to speak, free from theawkwardness of a young lady\'s presence,"" she said.  ""But \'tis not, as ithappens, and if I stay here, I shall be a protection.""In truth, he required one.  Sir Jeoffry broke into a torrent ofblasphemy.  He damned both kinsman and chaplain, and raged at theimpudence of both in daring to approach him, swearing to horsewhip mylord if they ever met, and to have the chaplain kicked out of the house,and beyond the park gates themselves.  But Mistress Clorinda chose tomake it her whim to take it in better humour, and as a joke with a finepoint to it.  She laughed at her father\'s storming, and while thechaplain quailed before it with pallid countenance and fairly hang-doglook, she seemed to find it but a cause for outbursts of merriment.""Hold thy tongue a bit, Dad,"" she cried, when he had reached his loudest,""and let his reverence tell us what his message is.  We have not evenheard it.""""Want not to hear it!"" shouted Sir Jeoffry.  ""Dost think I\'ll stand hisimpudence?  Not I!""""What was your message?"" demanded the young lady of the chaplain.  ""Youcannot return without delivering it.  Tell it to me.  _I_ choose it shallbe told.""The chaplain clutched and fumbled with his hat, pale, and dropping hiseyes upon the floor, for very fear.""Pluck up thy courage, man,"" said Clorinda.  ""I will uphold thee.  Themessage?""""Your pardon, Madam--\'twas this,"" the chaplain faltered.  ""My lordcommanded me to warn your honoured father--that if he did not beg you toleave off wearing--wearing--""""Breeches,"" said Mistress Clorinda, slapping her knee.The chaplain blushed with modesty, though he was a man of sallowcountenance.""No gentleman,"" he went on, going more lamely at eachword--""notwithstanding your great beauty--no gentleman--""""Would marry me?"" the young lady ended for him, with mercifulgood-humour.""For if you--if a young lady be permitted to bear herself in such amanner as will cause her to be held lightly, she can make no match thatwill not be a dishonour to her family--and--and--""""And may do worse!"" quoth Mistress Clo, and laughed until the room rang.Sir Jeoffry\'s rage was such as made him like to burst; but she restrainedhim when he would have flung his tankard at the chaplain\'s head, and amidhis storm of curses bundled the poor man out of the room, picking up hishat which in his hurry and fright he let fall, and thrusting it into hishand.""Tell his lordship,"" she said, laughing still as she spoke the finalwords, ""that I say he is right--and I will see to it that no disgracebefalls him.""""Forsooth, Dad,"" she said, returning, ""perhaps the old son ofa--""--something unmannerly--""is not so great a fool.  As for me, I meanto make a fine marriage and be a great lady, and I know of nonehereabouts to suit me but the old Earl of Dunstanwolde, and \'tis said herates at all but modest women, and, in faith, he might not find breechesmannerly.  I will not hunt in them again.""She did not, though once or twice when she was in a wild mood, and herfather entertained at dinner those of his companions whom she was themost inclined to, she swaggered in among them in her daintiest suits ofmale attire, and caused their wine-shot eyes to gloat over her boyish-maiden charms and jaunty airs and graces.On the night of her fifteenth birthday Sir Jeoffry gave a great dinner tohis boon companions and hers.  She had herself commanded that thereshould be no ladies at the feast; for she chose to announce that sheshould appear at no more such, having the wit to see that she was tootall a young lady for childish follies, and that she had now arrived atan age when her market must be made.""I shall have women enough henceforth to be dull with,"" she said.  ""Thouart but a poor match-maker, Dad, or wouldst have thought of it for me.But not once has it come into thy pate that I have no mother to angle inmy cause and teach me how to cast sheep\'s eyes at bachelors.  Long-tailedpetticoats from this time for me, and hoops and patches, and ogling overfans--until at last, if I play my cards well, some great lord will lookmy way and be taken by my shape and my manners.""""With thy shape, Clo, God knows every man will,"" laughed Sir Jeoffry,""but I fear me not with thy manners.  Thou hast the manners of a baggage,and they are second nature to thee.""""They are what I was born with,"" answered Mistress Clorinda.  ""They camefrom him that begot me, and he has not since improved them.  Butnow""--making a great sweeping curtsey, her impudent bright beauty almostdazzling his eyes--""now, after my birth-night, they will be bettered; butthis one night I will have my last fling.""When the men trooped into the black oak wainscotted dining-hall on theeventful night, they found their audacious young hostess awaiting them ingreater and more daring beauty than they had ever before beheld.  Shewore knee-breeches of white satin, a pink satin coat embroidered withsilver roses, white silk stockings, and shoes with great buckles ofbrilliants, revealing a leg so round and strong and delicately moulded,and a foot so arched and slender, as surely never before, they swore oneand all, woman had had to display.  She met them standing jauntilyastride upon the hearth, her back to the fire, and she greeted each oneas he came with some pretty impudence.  Her hair was tied back andpowdered, her black eyes were like lodestars, drawing all men, and hercolour was that of a ripe pomegranate.  She had a fine, haughty littleRoman nose, a mouth like a scarlet bow, a wonderful long throat, andround cleft chin.  A dazzling mien indeed she possessed, and ready enoughshe was to shine before them.  Sir Jeoffry was now elderly, having been aman of forty when united to his conjugal companion.  Most of his friendswere of his own age, so that it had not been with unripe youth MistressClorinda had been in the habit of consorting.  But upon this night anewcomer was among the guests.  He was a young relation of one of theolder men, and having come to his kinsman\'s house upon a visit, andhaving proved himself, in spite of his youth, to be a young fellow ofhumour, high courage in the hunting-field, and by no means averse eitherto entering upon or discussing intrigue and gallant adventure, had madehimself something of a favourite.  His youthful beauty for a man almostequalled that of Mistress Clorinda herself.  He had an elegant, fineshape, of great strength and vigour, his countenance was delicately ruddyand handsomely featured, his curling fair hair flowed loose upon hisshoulders, and, though masculine in mould, his ankle was as slender andhis buckled shoe as arched as her own.He was, it is true, twenty-four years of age and a man, while she was butfifteen and a woman, but being so tall and built with such unusual vigourof symmetry, she was a beauteous match for him, and both being attired infashionable masculine habit, these two pretty young fellows standingsmiling saucily at each other were a charming, though singular,spectacle.This young man was already well known in the modish world of town for hisbeauty and adventurous spirit.  He was indeed already a beau andconqueror of female hearts.  It was suspected that he cherished a privateambition to set the modes in beauties and embroidered waistcoats himselfin time, and be as renowned abroad and as much the town talk as certainother celebrated beaux had been before him.  The art of ogling tenderlyand of uttering soft nothings he had learned during his first season intown, and as he had a great melting blue eye, the figure of an Adonis,and a white and shapely hand for a ring, he was well equipped forconquest.  He had darted many an inflaming glance at Mistress Clorindabefore the first meats were removed.  Even in London he had heard a vaguerumour of this handsome young woman, bred among her father\'s dogs,horses, and boon companions, and ripening into a beauty likely to maketown faces pale.  He had almost fallen into the spleen on hearing thatshe had left her boy\'s clothes and vowed she would wear them no more, asabove all things he had desired to see how she carried them and whatcharms they revealed.  On hearing from his host and kinsman that she hadsaid that on her birth-night she would bid them farewell for ever bydonning them for the last time, he was consumed with eagerness to obtainan invitation.  This his kinsman besought for him, and, behold! the firstglance the beauty shot at him pierced his inflammable bosom like a dart.Never before had it been his fortune to behold female charms so dazzlingand eyes of such lustre and young majesty.  The lovely baggage had asaucy way of standing with her white jewelled hands in her pockets like apretty fop, and throwing up her little head like a modish beauty who wasof royal blood; and these two tricks alone, he felt, might have set onfire the heart of a man years older and colder than himself.If she had been of the order of soft-natured charmers, they would havefallen into each other\'s eyes before the wine was changed; but thisMistress Clorinda was not.  She did not fear to meet the full battery ofhis enamoured glances, but she did not choose to return them.  She playedher part of the pretty young fellow who was a high-spirited beauty, withmore of wit and fire than she had ever played it before.  The rollickinghunting-squires, who had been her play-fellows so long, devoured her withtheir delighted glances and roared with laughter at her sallies.  Theirjokes and flatteries were not of the most seemly, but she had not beenbred to seemliness and modesty, and was no more ignorant than if she hadbeen, in sooth, some gay young springald of a lad.  To her it was part ofthe entertainment that upon this last night they conducted themselves asbeseemed her boyish masquerading.  Though country-bred, she had livedamong companions who were men of the world and lived without restraints,and she had so far learned from them that at fifteen years old she was asworldly and as familiar with the devices of intrigue as she would be atforty.  So far she had not been pushed to practising them, her singularlife having thrown her among few of her own age, and those had chanced tobe of a sort she disdainfully counted as country bumpkins.But the young gallant introduced to-night into the world she lived in wasno bumpkin, and was a dandy of the town.  His name was Sir John Oxon, andhe had just come into his title and a pretty property.  His hands were aswhite and bejewelled as her own, his habit was of the latest fashionablecut, and his fair flowing locks scattered a delicate French perfume shedid not even know the name of.But though she observed all these attractions and found them powerful,young Sir John remarked, with a slight sinking qualm, that her great eyedid not fall before his amorous glances, but met them with high smilingreadiness, and her colour never blanched or heightened a whit for alltheir masterly skilfulness.  But he had sworn to himself that he wouldapproach close enough to her to fire off some fine speech before thenight was ended, and he endeavoured to bear himself with at least anoutward air of patience until he beheld his opportunity.When the last dish was removed and bottles and bumpers stood upon theboard, she sprang up on her chair and stood before them all, smiling downthe long table with eyes like flashing jewels.  Her hands were thrust inher pockets--with her pretty young fop\'s air, and she drew herself to herfull comely height, her beauteous lithe limbs and slender feet setsmartly together.  Twenty pairs of masculine eyes were turned upon herbeauty, but none so ardently as the young one\'s across the table.""Look your last on my fine shape,"" she proclaimed in her high, richvoice.  ""You will see but little of the lower part of it when it is hidin farthingales and petticoats.  Look your last before I go to don myfine lady\'s furbelows.""And when they filled their glasses and lifted them and shouted admiringjests to her, she broke into one of her stable-boy songs, and sang it inthe voice of a skylark.No man among them was used to showing her the courtesies of politebreeding.  She had been too long a boy to them for that to have enteredany mind, and when she finished her song, sprang down, and made for thedoor, Sir John beheld his long-looked-for chance, and was there beforeher to open it with a great bow, made with his hand upon his heart andhis fair locks falling.""You rob us of the rapture of beholding great beauties, Madam,"" he saidin a low, impassioned voice.  ""But there should be indeed but _one_ happyman whose bliss it is to gaze upon such perfections.""""I am fifteen years old to-night,"" she answered; ""and as yet I have notset eyes upon him.""""How do you know that, madam?"" he said, bowing lower still.She laughed her great rich laugh.""Forsooth, I do not know,"" she retorted.  ""He may be here this very nightamong this company; and as it might be so, I go to don my modesty.""And she bestowed on him a parting shot in the shape of one of herprettiest young fop waves of the hand, and was gone from him.* * * * *When the door closed behind her and Sir John Oxon returned to the table,for a while a sort of dulness fell upon the party.  Not being of quickminds or sentiments, these country roisterers failed to understand theheavy cloud of spleen and lack of spirit they experienced, and as theyfilled their glasses and tossed off one bumper after another to cure it,they soon began again to laugh and fell into boisterous joking.They talked mostly, indeed, of their young playfellow, of whom they felt,in some indistinct manner, they were to be bereft; they rallied SirJeoffry, told stories of her childhood and made pictures of her buddingbeauties, comparing them with those of young ladies who were celebratedtoasts.""She will sail among them like a royal frigate,"" said one; ""and they willpale before her lustre as a tallow dip does before an illumination.""The clock struck twelve before she returned to them.  Just as the laststroke sounded the door was thrown open, and there she stood, a woman oneach side of her, holding a large silver candelabra bright with waxtapers high above her, so that she was in a flood of light.She was attired in rich brocade of crimson and silver, and wore a greathooped petticoat, which showed off her grandeur, her waist of no morebigness than a man\'s hands could clasp, set in its midst like the stem ofa flower; her black hair was rolled high and circled with jewels, herfair long throat blazed with a collar of diamonds, and the majesty of hereye and lip and brow made up a mien so dazzling that every man sprang tohis feet beholding her.She made a sweeping obeisance and then stood up before them, her headthrown back and her lips curving in the triumphant mocking smile of agreat beauty looking upon them all as vassals.""Down upon your knees,"" she cried, ""and drink to me kneeling.  From thisnight all men must bend so--all men on whom I deign to cast my eyes.""']"
78,6,Chapter 6,"['V--""Not I,"" said she.  ""There thou mayst trust me.  I would notbe found out.""She went no more a-hunting in boy\'s clothes, but from this time forwardwore brocades and paduasoys, fine lawn and lace.  Her tirewoman was keptso busily engaged upon making rich habits, fragrant waters and essences,and so running at her bidding to change her gown or dress her head insome new fashion, that her life was made to her a weighty burden to bear,and also a painful one.  Her place had before been an easy one but forher mistress\'s choleric temper, but it was so no more.  Never had younglady been so exacting and so tempestuous when not pleased with theadorning of her face and shape.  In the presence of polite strangers,whether ladies or gentlemen, Mistress Clorinda in these days chose tochasten her language and give less rein to her fantastical passions, butalone in her closet with her woman, if a riband did but not suit herfancy, or a hoop not please, she did not fear to be as scurrilous as shechose.  In this discreet retirement she rapped out oaths and boxed herwoman\'s ears with a vigorous hand, tore off her gowns and stamped thembeneath her feet, or flung pots of pomade at the poor woman\'s head.  Shetook these freedoms with such a readiness and spirit that she was servedwith a despatch and humbleness scarcely to be equalled, and, it iscertain, never excelled.The high courage and undaunted will which had been the engines she hadused to gain her will from her infant years aided her in these days tocarry out what her keen mind and woman\'s wit had designed, which was totake the county by storm with her beauty, and reign toast and enslaveruntil such time as she won the prize of a husband of rich estates andnotable rank.It was soon bruited abroad, to the amazement of the county, that MistressClorinda Wildairs had changed her strange and unseemly habits of life,and had become as much a young lady of fashion and breeding as her birthand charm demanded.  This was first made known by her appearing oneSunday morning at church, accompanied--as though attended with a retinueof servitors--by Mistress Wimpole and her two sisters, whose plain faces,awkward shape, and still more awkward attire were such a foil to herglowing loveliness as set it in high relief.  It was seldom that thecoach from Wildairs Hall drew up before the lych-gate, but upon rareSunday mornings Mistress Wimpole and her two charges contrived, if SirJeoffry was not in an ill-humour and the coachman was complaisant, to bedriven to service.  Usually, however, they trudged afoot, and, if the daychanced to be sultry, arrived with their snub-nosed faces of a high andshiny colour, or if the country roads were wet, with their petticoatsbemired.This morning, when the coach drew up, the horses were well groomed, thecoachman smartly dressed, and a footman was in attendance, who sprang toearth and opened the door with a flourish.The loiterers in the churchyard, and those who were approaching the gateor passing towards the church porch, stared with eyes wide stretched inwonder and incredulity.  Never had such a thing before been beheld orheard of as what they now saw in broad daylight.Mistress Clorinda, clad in highest town fashion, in brocades and silverlace and splendid furbelows, stepped forth from the chariot with the airof a queen.  She had the majestic composure of a young lady who had wornnothing less modish than such raiment all her life, and who had prayeddecorously beneath her neighbours\' eyes since she had left her nurse\'scare.Her sisters and their governess looked timorous, and as if they knew notwhere to cast their eyes for shamefacedness; but not so MistressClorinda, who moved forward with a stately, swimming gait, her fine headin the air.  As she stepped into the porch a young gentleman drew backand made a profound obeisance to her.  She cast her eyes upon him andreturned it with a grace and condescension which struck the beholdersdumb with admiring awe.  To some of the people of a commoner sort he wasa stranger, but all connected with the gentry knew he was Sir John Oxon,who was staying at Eldershawe Park with his relative, whose estate itwas.How Mistress Clorinda contrived to manage it no one was aware butherself, but after a few appearances at church she appeared at otherplaces.  She was seen at dinners at fine houses, and began to be seen atrouts and balls.  Where she was seen she shone, and with such radiance ascaused matchmaking matrons great dismay, and their daughters woefulqualms.  Once having shone, she could not be extinguished or hidden undera bushel; for, being of rank and highly connected through mother as wellas father, and playing her cards with great wit and skill, she could notbe thrust aside.At her first hunt ball she set aflame every male breast in the shire,unmasking such a battery of charms as no man could withstand the fire of.Her dazzling eye, her wondrous shape, the rich music of her laugh, andthe mocking wit of her sharp saucy tongue were weapons to have armed adozen women, and she was but one, and in the first rich tempting glow ofblooming youth.She turned more heads and caused more quarrels than she could havecounted had she sat up half the night.  She went to her coach with herfather followed by a dozen gallants, each ready to spit the other for asmile.  Her smiles were wondrous, but there seemed always a touch ofmockery or disdain in them which made them more remembered than if theyhad been softer.One man there was, who perchance found something in her high glance notwholly scornful, but he was used to soft treatment from women, and had,in sooth, expected milder glances than were bestowed upon him.  This wasyoung Sir John Oxon, who had found himself among the fair sex that nightas great a beau as she had been a belle; but two dances he had won fromher, and this was more than any other man could boast, and what othergallants envied him with darkest hatred.Sir Jeoffry, who had watched her as she queened it amongst rakes and fopsand honest country squires and knights, had marked the vigour with whichthey plied her with an emotion which was a new sensation to his drink-bemuddled brain.  So far as it was in his nature to love another thanhimself, he had learned to love this young lovely virago of his own fleshand blood, perchance because she was the only creature who had neverquailed before him, and had always known how to bend him to her will.When the chariot rode away, he looked at her as she sat erect in theearly morning light, as unblenching, bright, and untouched in bloom as ifshe had that moment risen from her pillow and washed her face in dew.  Hewas not so drunk as he had been at midnight, but he was a little maudlin.""By God, thou art handsome, Clo!"" he said.  ""By God, I never saw a finerwoman!""""Nor I,"" she answered back, ""which I thank Heaven for.""""Thou pretty, brazen baggage,"" her father laughed.  ""Old Dunstanwoldelooked thee well over to-night.  He never looked away from the moment heclapped eyes on thee.""""That I knew better than thee, Dad,"" said the beauty; ""and I saw that hecould not have done it if he had tried.  If there comes no richer,younger great gentleman, he shall marry me.""""Thou hast a sharp eye and a keen wit,"" said Sir Jeoffry, looking askanceat her with a new maggot in his brain.  ""Wouldst never play the fool, Iwarrant.  They will press thee hard and \'twill be hard to withstand theirlove-making, but I shall never have to mount and ride off with pistols inmy holsters to bring back a man and make him marry thee, as Chris Crowellhad to do for his youngest wench.  Thou wouldst never play the fool, Iwarrant--wouldst thou, Clo?""She tossed her head and laughed like a young scornful devil, showing herwhite pearl teeth between her lips\' scarlet.""Not I,"" she said.  ""There thou mayst trust me.  _I_ would not be foundout.""She played her part as triumphant beauty so successfully that thecleverest managing mother in the universe could not have bettered herposition.  Gallants brawled for her; honest men fell at her feet;romantic swains wrote verses to her, praising her eyes, her delicatebosom, the carnation of her cheek, and the awful majesty of her mien.  Inevery revel she was queen, in every contest of beauties Venus, in everyspectacle of triumph empress of them all.The Earl of Dunstanwolde, who had the oldest name and the richest estatesin his own county and the six adjoining ones, who, having made a love-match in his prime, and lost wife and heir but a year after his nuptials,had been the despair of every maid and mother who knew him, because hewould not be melted to a marriageable mood.  After the hunt ball thismourning nobleman, who was by this time of ripe years, had appeared inthe world again as he had not done for many years.  Before many monthshad elapsed, it was known that his admiration of the new beauty wasconfessed, and it was believed that he but waited further knowledge ofher to advance to the point of laying his title and estates at her feet.But though, two years before, the entire county would have rated lowindeed the wit and foresight of the man who had even hinted thepossibility of such honour and good fortune being in prospect for theyoung lady, so great was Mistress Clorinda\'s brilliant and noble beauty,and with such majesty she bore herself in these times, that there wereeven those who doubted whether she would think my lord a rich enoughprize for her, and if, when he fell upon his knees, she would deign tobecome his countess, feeling that she had such splendid wares to disposeof as might be bartered for a duke, when she went to town and to court.During the length of more than one man\'s lifetime after, the reign ofMistress Clorinda Wildairs was a memory recalled over the bottle at thedining-table among men, some of whom had but heard their fathers vaunther beauties.  It seemed as if in her person there was not a single flaw,or indeed a charm, which had not reached the highest point of beauty.  Forshape she might have vied with young Diana, mounted side by side with herupon a pedestal; her raven locks were of a length and luxuriance toclothe her as a garment, her great eye commanded and flashed as Juno\'smight have done in the goddess\'s divinest moments of lovely pride, andthough it was said none ever saw it languish, each man who adored her wasmaddened by the secret belief that Venus\' self could not so melt in loveas she if she would stoop to loving--as each one prayed shemight--himself.  Her hands and feet, her neck, the slimness of her waist,her mantling crimson and ivory white, her little ear, her scarlet lip,the pearls between them and her long white throat, were perfection eachand all, and catalogued with oaths of rapture.""She hath such beauties,"" one admirer said, ""that a man must toast themall and cannot drink to her as to a single woman.  And she hath so manythat to slight none her servant must go from the table reeling.""There was but one thing connected with her which was not a weapon to herhand, and this was, that she was not a fortune.  Sir Jeoffry had drunkand rioted until he had but little left.  He had cut his timber and lethis estate go to rack, having, indeed, no money to keep it up.  The greatHall, which had once been a fine old place, was almost a ruin.  Itscarved oak and noble rooms and galleries were all of its past splendoursthat remained.  All had been sold that could be sold, and all the outcomehad been spent.  The county, indeed, wondered where Mistress Clorinda\'sfine clothes came from, and knew full well why she was not taken to courtto kneel to the Queen.  That she was waiting for this to make her match,the envious were quite sure, and did not hesitate to whisper prettyloudly.The name of one man of rank and fortune after another was spoken of asthat of a suitor to her hand, but in some way it was discovered that sherefused them all.  It was also known that they continued to worship her,and that at any moment she could call even the best among them back.  Itseemed that, while all the men were enamoured of her, there was not onewho could cure himself of his passion, however hopeless it might be.Her wit was as great as her beauty, and she had a spirit before which noman could stand if she chose to be disdainful.  To some she was so, andhad the whim to flout them with great brilliancy.  Encounters with herwere always remembered, and if heard by those not concerned, wereconsidered worthy both of recollection and of being repeated to theworld; she had a tongue so nimble and a wit so full of fire.Young Sir John Oxon\'s visit to his relative at Eldershawe being at anend, he returned to town, and remaining there through a few weeks offashionable gaiety, won new reputations as a triumpher over the femaleheart.  He made some renowned conquests and set the mode in some newessences and sword-knots.  But even these triumphs appeared to pall uponhim shortly, since he deserted the town and returned again to thecountry, where, on this occasion, he did not stay with his relative, butwith Sir Jeoffry himself, who had taken a boisterous fancy to him.It had been much marked since the altered life of Mistress Clorinda thatshe, who had previously defied all rules laid down on behaviour for youngladies, and had been thought to do so because she knew none of them, nowproved that her wild fashion had been but wilfulness, since it was seenthat she must have observed and marked manners with the best.  Thereseemed no decorum she did not know how to observe with the most naturalgrace.  It was, indeed, all grace and majesty, there being no suggestionof the prude about her, but rather the manner of a young lady having beenborn with pride and stateliness, and most carefully bred.  This was theresult of her wondrous wit, the highness of her talents, and the strengthof her will, which was of such power that she could carry out withoutfail anything she chose to undertake.  There are some women who havebeauty, and some who have wit or vigour of understanding, but shepossessed all three, and with them such courage and strength of nerve aswould have well equipped a man.Quick as her wit was and ready as were her brilliant quips and sallies,there was no levity in her demeanour, and she kept Mistress MargeryWimpole in discreet attendance upon her, as if she had been the daughterof a Spanish Hidalgo, never to be approached except in the presence ofher duenna.  Poor Mistress Margery, finding her old fears removed, wasoverpowered with new ones.  She had no lawlessness or hoyden manners tocontend with, but instead a haughtiness so high and demands so great thather powers could scarcely satisfy the one or her spirit stand up beforethe other.""It is as if one were lady-in-waiting to her Majesty\'s self,"" she used towhimper when she was alone and dare do so.  ""Surely the Queen has notsuch a will and such a temper.  She will have me toil to look worthy ofher in my habit, and bear myself like a duchess in dignity.  Alack!  Ihave practised my obeisance by the hour to perfect it, so that I mayescape her wrath.  And I must know how to look, and when and where tosit, and with what air of being near at hand, while I must see nothing!And I must drag my failing limbs hither and thither with genteel easewhile I ache from head to foot, being neither young nor strong.""The poor lady was so overawed by, and yet so admired, her charge, that itwas piteous to behold.""She is an arrant fool,"" quoth Mistress Clorinda to her father.  ""A niceduenna she would be, forsooth, if she were with a woman who neededwatching.  She could be hoodwinked as it pleased me a dozen times a day.It is I who am her guard, not she mine!  But a beauty must drag some spyabout with her, it seems, and she I can make to obey me like a spaniel.We can afford no better, and she is well born, and since I bought her thepurple paduasoy and the new lappets she has looked well enough to serve.""""Dunstanwolde need not fear for thee now,"" said Sir Jeoffry.  ""Thou art aclever and foreseeing wench, Clo.""""Dunstanwolde nor any man!"" she answered.  ""There will be no gossip ofme.  It is Anne and Barbara thou must look to, Dad, lest their plainfaces lead them to show soft hearts.  My face is my fortune!""When Sir John Oxon paid his visit to Sir Jeoffry the days of MistressMargery were filled with carking care.  The night before he arrived,Mistress Clorinda called her to her closet and laid upon her her commandsin her own high way.  She was under her woman\'s hands, and while hergreat mantle of black hair fell over the back of her chair and lay on thefloor, her tirewoman passing the brush over it, lock by lock, she was ather greatest beauty.  Either she had been angered or pleased, for hercheek wore a bloom even deeper and richer than usual, and there was aspark like a diamond under the fringe of her lashes.At her first timorous glance at her, Mistress Margery thought she musthave been angered, the spark so burned in her eyes, and so evident wasthe light but quick heave of her bosom; but the next moment it seemed asif she must be in a pleasant humour, for a little smile deepened thedimples in the corner of her bowed, full lips.  But quickly she looked upand resumed her stately air.""This gentleman who comes to visit to-morrow,"" she said, ""Sir JohnOxon--do you know aught of him?""""But little, Madame,"" Mistress Margery answered with fear and humility.""Then it will be well that you should, since I have commands to lay uponyou concerning him,"" said the beauty.""You do me honour,"" said the poor gentlewoman.Mistress Clorinda looked her straight in the face.""He is a gentleman from town, the kinsman of Lord Eldershawe,"" she said.""He is a handsome man, concerning whom many women have been fools.  Hechooses to allow it to be said that he is a conqueror of female heartsand virtue, even among women of fashion and rank.  If this be said in thetown, what may not be said in the country?  He shall wear no such graceshere.  He chooses to pay his court to me.  He is my father\'s guest and aman of fashion.  Let him make as many fine speeches as he has the willto.  I will listen or not as I choose.  I am used to words.  But see thatwe are not left alone.""The tirewoman pricked up her ears.  Clorinda saw her in the glass.""Attend to thy business if thou dost not want a box o\' the ear,"" she saidin a tone which made the woman start.""You would not be left alone with the gentleman, Madam?"" falteredMistress Margery.""If he comes to boast of conquests,"" said Mistress Clorinda, looking ather straight again and drawing down her black brows, ""I will play ascleverly as he.  He cannot boast greatly of one whom he never makes hiscourt to but in the presence of a kinswoman of ripe years.  Understandthat this is to be your task.""""I will remember,"" Madam, answered Mistress Margery.  ""I will bear myselfas you command.""""That is well,"" said Mistress Clorinda.  ""I will keep you no more.  Youmay go.""']"
78,7,Chapter 7,"['VI--Relating how Mistress Anne discovered a miniatureThe good gentlewoman took her leave gladly.  She had spent a life intimid fears of such things and persons as were not formed by Nature toexcite them, but never had she experienced such humble terrors as thosewith which Mistress Clorinda inspired her.  Never did she approach herwithout inward tremor, and never did she receive permission to departfrom her presence without relief.  And yet her beauty and wit and spirithad no admirer regarding them with more of wondering awe.In the bare west wing of the house, comfortless though the neglect of itsmaster had made it, there was one corner where she was unafraid.  Herfirst charges, Mistress Barbara and Mistress Anne, were young ladies ofgentle spirit.  Their sister had said of them that their spirit was aspoor as their looks.  It could not be said of them by any one that theyhad any pretension to beauty, but that which Mistress Clorinda rated atas poor spirit was the one element of comfort in their poor dependentkinswoman\'s life.  They gave her no ill words, they indulged in nofantastical whims and vapours, and they did not even seem to expect otherentertainment than to walk the country roads, to play with their littlelap-dog Cupid, wind silks for their needlework, and please themselveswith their embroidery-frames.To them their sister appeared a goddess whom it would be presumptuous toapproach in any frame of mind quite ordinary.  Her beauty must beheightened by rich adornments, while their plain looks were left withoutthe poorest aid.  It seemed but fitting that what there was to spend mustbe spent on her.  They showed no signs of resentment, and took withgratitude such cast-off finery as she deigned at times to bestow uponthem, when it was no longer useful to herself.  She was too full of theoccupations of pleasure to have had time to notice them, even if hernature had inclined her to the observance of family affections.  It wastheir habit, when they knew of her going out in state, to watch herincoming and outgoing through a peep-hole in a chamber window.  MistressMargery told them stories of her admirers and of her triumphs, of thecounty gentlemen of fortune who had offered themselves to her, and of themodes of life in town of the handsome Sir John Oxon, who, without doubt,was of the circle of her admiring attendants, if he had not fallentotally her victim, as others had.Of the two young women, it was Mistress Anne who had the more parts, andthe attraction of the mind the least dull.  In sooth, Nature had dealtwith both in a niggardly fashion, but Mistress Barbara was the plainerand the more foolish.  Mistress Anne had, perchance, the tendererfeelings, and was in secret given to a certain sentimentality.  She wasthin and stooping, and had but a muddy complexion; her hair was heavy, itis true, but its thickness and weight seemed naught but an ungratefulburden; and she had a dull, soft eye.  In private she was fond of readingsuch romances as she could procure by stealth from the library of booksgathered together in past times by some ancestor Sir Jeoffry regarded asan idiot.  Doubtless she met with strange reading in the volumes she tookto her closet, and her simple virgin mind found cause for the solving ofmany problems; but from the pages she contrived to cull stories of lordlylovers and cruel or kind beauties, whose romances created for her astrange world of pleasure in the midst of her loneliness.  Poor,neglected young female, with every guileless maiden instinct withered atbirth, she had need of some tender dreams to dwell upon, though Fateherself seemed to have decreed that they must be no more than visions.It was, in sooth, always the beauteous Clorinda about whose charms shebuilded her romances.  In her great power she saw that for which knightsfought in tourney and great kings committed royal sins, and to hersplendid beauty she had in secrecy felt that all might be forgiven.  Shecherished such fancies of her, that one morning, when she believed herabsent from the house, she stole into the corridor upon which Clorinda\'sapartment opened.  Her first timid thought had been, that if a chamberdoor were opened she might catch a glimpse of some of the splendours hersister\'s woman was surely laying out for her wearing at a birth-nightball, at the house of one of the gentry of the neighbourhood.  But it sohappened that she really found the door of entrance open, which, indeed,she had not more than dared to hope, and finding it so, she stayed herfootsteps to gaze with beating heart within.  On the great bed, which wasof carved oak and canopied with tattered tapestry, there lay spread suchsplendours as she had never beheld near to before.  \'Twas blue and silverbrocade Mistress Clorinda was to shine in to-night; it lay spread forthin all its dimensions.  The beautiful bosom and shoulders were to bebared to the eyes of scores of adorers, but rich lace was to set theirbeauties forth, and strings of pearls.  Why Sir Jeoffry had not sold hislady\'s jewels before he became enamoured of her six-year-old child itwould be hard to explain.  There was a great painted fan with jewels inthe sticks, and on the floor--as if peeping forth from beneath thebravery of the expanded petticoats--was a pair of blue and silver shoes,high-heeled and arched and slender.  In gazing at them Mistress Anne losther breath, thinking that in some fashion they had a regal air of beingmade to trample hearts beneath them.To the gentle, hapless virgin, to whom such possessions were as thewardrobe of a queen, the temptation to behold them near was too great.She could not forbear from passing the threshold, and she did withheaving breast.  She approached the bed and gazed; she dared to touch thescented gloves that lay by the outspread petticoat of blue and silver;she even laid a trembling finger upon the pointed bodice, which was soslender that it seemed small enough for even a child.""Ah me,"" she sighed gently, ""how beautiful she will be!  How beautiful!And all of them will fall at her feet, as is not to be wondered at.  Andit was always so all her life, even when she was an infant, and all gaveher her will because of her beauty and her power.  She hath a greatpower.  Barbara and I are not so.  We are dull and weak, and dare notspeak our minds.  It is as if we were creatures of another world; but Hewho rules all things has so willed it for us.  He has given it to us forour portion--our portion.""Her dull, poor face dropped a little as she spoke the words, and her eyesfell upon the beauteous tiny shoes, which seemed to trample even when nofoot was within them.  She stooped to take one in her hand, but as shewas about to lift it something which seemed to have been dropped upon thefloor, and to have rolled beneath the valance of the bed, touched herhand.  It was a thing to which a riband was attached--an ivoryminiature--and she picked it up wondering.  She stood up gazing at it, insuch bewilderment to find her eyes upon it that she scarce knew what shedid.  She did not mean to pry; she would not have had the daring so to doif she had possessed the inclination.  But the instant her eyes told herwhat they saw, she started and blushed as she had never blushed before inher tame life.  The warm rose mantled her cheeks, and even suffused theneck her chaste kerchief hid.  Her eye kindled with admiration and anemotion new to her indeed.""How beautiful!"" she said.  ""He is like a young Adonis, and has thebearing of a royal prince!  How can it--by what strange chance hath itcome here?""She had not regarded it more than long enough to have uttered thesewords, when a fear came upon her, and she felt that she had fallen intomisfortune.""What must I do with it?"" she trembled.  ""What will she say, whether sheknows of its being within the chamber or not?  She will be angry with methat I have dared to touch it.  What shall I do?""She regarded it again with eyes almost suffused.  Her blush and thesensibility of her emotion gave to her plain countenance a new livelinessof tint and expression.""I will put it back where I found it,"" she said, ""and the one who knowsit will find it later.  It cannot be she--it cannot be she!  If I laid iton her table she would rate me bitterly--and she can be bitter when shewill.""She bent and placed it within the shadow of the valance again, and as shefelt it touch the hard oak of the polished floor her bosom rose with asoft sigh.""It is an unseemly thing to do,"" she said; ""\'tis as though one wereuncivil; but I dare not--I dare not do otherwise.""She would have turned to leave the apartment, being much overcome by theincident, but just as she would have done so she heard the sound ofhorses\' feet through the window by which she must pass, and looked out tosee if it was Clorinda who was returning from her ride.  MistressClorinda was a matchless horsewoman, and a marvel of loveliness andspirit she looked when she rode, sitting upon a horse such as no otherwoman dared to mount--always an animal of the greatest beauty, but of sodangerous a spirit that her riding-whip was loaded like a man\'s.This time it was not she; and when Mistress Anne beheld the younggentleman who had drawn rein in the court she started backward and puther hand to her heart, the blood mantling her pale cheek again in aflood.  But having started back, the next instant she started forward togaze again, all her timid soul in her eyes.""\'Tis he!"" she panted; ""\'tis he himself!  He hath come in hope to speakwith my sister, and she is abroad.  Poor gentleman, he hath come in suchhigh spirit, and must ride back heavy of heart.  How comely, and howfinely clad he is!""He was, in sooth, with his rich riding-habit, his handsome face, hisplumed hat, and the sun shining on the fair luxuriant locks which fellbeneath it.  It was Sir John Oxon, and he was habited as when he rode inthe park in town and the court was there.  Not so were attired thecountry gentry whom Anne had been wont to see, though many of them werewell mounted, knowing horseflesh and naught else, as they did.She pressed her cheek against the side of the oriel window, over whichthe ivy grew thickly.  She was so intent that she could not withdraw hergaze.  She watched him as he turned away, having received his dismissal,and she pressed her face closer that she might follow him as he rode downthe long avenue of oak-trees, his servant riding behind.Thus she bent forward gazing, until he turned and the oaks hid him fromher sight; and even then the spell was not dissolved, and she stillregarded the place where he had passed, until a sound behind her made herstart violently.  It was a peal of laughter, high and rich, and when sheso started and turned to see whom it might be, she beheld her sisterClorinda, who was standing just within the threshold, as if movement hadbeen arrested by what had met her eye as she came in.  Poor Anne put herhand to her side again.""Oh sister!"" she gasped; ""oh sister!"" but could say no more.She saw that she had thought falsely, and that Clorinda had not been outat all, for she was in home attire; and even in the midst of hertrepidation there sprang into Anne\'s mind the awful thought that throughsome servant\'s blunder the comely young visitor had been sent away.  Forherself, she expected but to be driven forth with wrathful, disdainfulwords for her presumption.  For what else could she hope from thissplendid creature, who, while of her own flesh and blood, had neverseemed to regard her as being more than a poor superfluous underling?  Butstrangely enough, there was no anger in Clorinda\'s eyes; she but laughed,as though what she had seen had made her merry.""You here, Anne,"" she said, ""and looking with light-mindedness aftergallant gentlemen!  Mistress Margery should see to this and watch moreclosely, or we shall have unseemly stories told.  _You_, sister, withyour modest face and bashfulness!  I had not thought it of you.""Suddenly she crossed the room to where her sister stood drooping, andseized her by the shoulder, so that she could look her well in the face.""What,"" she said, with a mocking not quite harsh--""What is this?  Does aglance at a fine gallant, even taken from behind an oriel window, makesuch change indeed?  I never before saw this look, nor this colour,forsooth; it hath improved thee wondrously, Anne--wondrously.""""Sister,"" faltered Anne, ""I so desired to see your birth-night ball-gown,of which Mistress Margery hath much spoken--I so desired--I thought itwould not matter if, the door being open and it spread forth upon thebed--I--I stole a look at it.  And then I was tempted--and came in.""""And then was tempted more,"" Clorinda laughed, still regarding herdowncast countenance shrewdly, ""by a thing far less to be resisted--afine gentleman from town, with love-locks falling on his shoulders andladies\' hearts strung at his saddle-bow by scores.  Which found you themost beautiful?""""Your gown is splendid, sister,"" said Anne, with modest shyness.  ""Therewill be no beauty who will wear another like it; or should there be one,she will not carry it as you will.""""But the man--the man, Anne,"" Clorinda laughed again.  ""What of the man?""Anne plucked up just enough of her poor spirit to raise her eyes to thebrilliant ones that mocked at her.""With such gentlemen, sister,"" she said, ""is it like that _I_ have aughtto do?""Mistress Clorinda dropped her hand and left laughing.""\'Tis true,"" she said, ""it is not; but for this one time, Anne, thoulookest almost a woman.""""\'Tis not beauty alone that makes womanhood,"" said Anne, her head on herbreast again.  ""In some book I have read that--that it is mostly pain.  Iam woman enough for that.""""You have read--you have read,"" quoted Clorinda.  ""You are the bookworm,I remember, and filch romances and poems from the shelves.  And you haveread that it is mostly pain that makes a woman?  \'Tis not true.  \'Tis apoor lie.  _I_ am a woman and I do not suffer--for I _will_ not, that Iswear!  And when I take an oath I keep it, mark you!  It is men womensuffer for; that was what your scholar meant--for such fine gentlemen asthe one you have just watched while he rode away.  More fools they!  Noman shall make _me_ womanly in such a fashion, I promise you!  Let _them_wince and kneel; _I_ will not.""""Sister,"" Anne faltered, ""I thought you were not within.  The gentlemanwho rode away--did the servants know?""""That did they,"" quoth Clorinda, mocking again.  ""They knew that I wouldnot receive him to-day, and so sent him away.  He might have known asmuch himself, but he is an arrant popinjay, and thinks all women wish tolook at his fine shape, and hear him flatter them when he is in themood.""""You would not--let him enter?""Clorinda threw her graceful body into a chair with more light laughter.""I would not,"" she answered.  ""You cannot understand such ingratitude,poor Anne; you would have treated him more softly.  Sit down and talk tome, and I will show thee my furbelows myself.  All women like to chatterof their laced bodices and petticoats.  _That_ is what makes a woman.""Anne was tremulous with relief and pleasure.  It was as if a queen hadbid her to be seated.  She sat almost with the humble lack of ease aserving-woman might have shown.  She had never seen Clorinda wear such anair before, and never had she dreamed that she would so open herself toany fellow-creature.  She knew but little of what her sister wascapable--of the brilliancy of her charm when she chose to condescend, ofthe deigning softness of her manner when she chose to please, of her arch-pleasantries and cutting wit, and of the strange power she could wieldover any human being, gentle or simple, with whom she came in contact.But if she had not known of these things before, she learned to know themthis morning.  For some reason best known to herself, Mistress Clorindawas in a high good humour.  She kept Anne with her for more than an hour,and was dazzling through every moment of its passing.  She showed her thesplendours she was to shine in at the birth-night ball, even bringingforth her jewels and displaying them.  She told her stories of the houseof which the young heir to-day attained his majority, and mocked at thepoor youth because he was ungainly, and at a distance had been her slavesince his nineteenth year.""I have scarce looked at him,"" she said.  ""He is a lout, with great eyesstaring, and a red nose.  It does not need that one should look at men towin them.  They look at us, and that is enough.""To poor Mistress Anne, who had seen no company and listened to no wits,the entertainment bestowed upon her was as wonderful as a night at theplayhouse would have been.  To watch the vivid changing face; to hearkento jesting stories of men and women who seemed like the heroes andheroines of her romances; to hear love itself--the love she trembled andpalpitated at the mere thought of--spoken of openly as an experiencewhich fell to all; to hear it mocked at with dainty or biting quips; tolearn that women of all ages played with, enjoyed, or lost themselves forit--it was with her as if a nun had been withdrawn from her cloister andplunged into the vortex of the world.""Sister,"" she said, looking at the Beauty with humble, adoring eyes, ""youmake me feel that my romances are true.  You tell such things.  It islike seeing pictures of things to hear you talk.  No wonder that alllisten to you, for indeed \'tis wonderful the way you have with words.  Youuse them so that \'tis as though they had shapes of their own and colours,and you builded with them.  I thank you for being so gracious to me, whohave seen so little, and cannot tell the poor, quiet things I have seen.""And being led into the loving boldness by her gratitude, she bent forwardand touched with her lips the fair hand resting on the chair\'s arm.Mistress Clorinda fixed her fine eyes upon her in a new way.""I\' faith, it doth not seem fair, Anne,"" she said.  ""I should not like tochange lives with thee.  Thou hast eyes like a shot pheasant--soft, andwith the bright hid beneath the dull.  Some man might love them, even ifthou art no beauty.  Stay,"" suddenly; ""methinks--""She uprose from her chair and went to the oaken wardrobe, and threw thedoor of it open wide while she looked within.""There is a gown and tippet or so here, and a hood and some ribands Imight do without,"" she said.  ""My woman shall bear them to your chamber,and show you how to set them to rights.  She is a nimble-fingeredcreature, and a gown of mine would give almost stuff enough to make youtwo.  Then some days, when I am not going abroad and Mistress Margeryfrets me too much, I will send for you to sit with me, and you shalllisten to the gossip when a visitor drops in to have a dish of tea.""Anne would have kissed her feet then, if she had dared to do so.  Sheblushed red all over, and adored her with a more worshipping gaze thanbefore.""I should not have dared to hope so much,"" she stammered.  ""I couldnot--perhaps it is not fitting--perhaps I could not bear myself as Ishould.  I would try to show myself a gentlewoman and seemly.  I--I _am_a gentlewoman, though I have learned so little.  I could not be aught buta gentlewoman, could I, sister, being of your own blood and my parents\'child?"" half afraid to presume even this much.""No,"" said Clorinda.  ""Do not be a fool, Anne, and carry yourself toohumbly before the world.  You can be as humble as you like to me.""""I shall--I shall be your servant and worship you, sister,"" cried thepoor soul, and she drew near and kissed again the white hand which hadbestowed with such royal bounty all this joy.  It would not have occurredto her that a cast-off robe and riband were but small largesse.It was not a minute after this grateful caress that Clorinda made a sharpmovement--a movement which was so sharp that it seemed to be one ofdismay.  At first, as if involuntarily, she had raised her hand to hertucker, and after doing so she started--though \'twas but for a second\'sspace, after which her face was as it had been before.""What is it?"" exclaimed Anne.  ""Have you lost anything?""""No,"" quoth Mistress Clorinda quite carelessly, as she once more turnedto the contents of the oaken wardrobe; ""but I thought I missed a trinketI was wearing for a wager, and I would not lose it before the bet iswon.""""Sister,"" ventured Anne before she left her and went away to her own dullworld in the west wing, ""there is a thing I can do if you will allow me.I can mend your tapestry hangings which have holes in them.  I am quickat my needle, and should love to serve you in such poor ways as I can;and it is not seemly that they should be so worn.  All things about youshould be beautiful and well kept.""""Can you make these broken things beautiful?"" said Clorinda.  ""Thenindeed you shall.  You may come here to mend them when you will.""""They are very fine hangings, though so old and ill cared for,"" saidAnne, looking up at them; ""and I shall be only too happy sitting herethinking of all you are doing while I am at my work.""""Thinking of all I am doing?"" laughed Mistress Clorinda.  ""That wouldgive you such wondrous things to dream of, Anne, that you would have notime for your needle, and my hangings would stay as they are.""""I can think and darn also,"" said Mistress Anne, ""so I will come.""']"
78,8,Chapter 8,"['VII--\'Twas the face of Sir John Oxon the moon shone uponFrom that time henceforward into the young woman\'s dull life there came alittle change.  It did not seem a little change to her, but a great one,though to others it would have seemed slight indeed.  She was anaffectionate, house-wifely creature, who would have made the best ofwives and mothers if it had been so ordained by Fortune, and something ofher natural instincts found outlet in the furtive service she paid hersister, who became the empress of her soul.  She darned and patched thetattered hangings with a wonderful neatness, and the hours she spent atwork in the chamber were to her almost as sacred as hours spent atreligious duty, or as those nuns and novices give to embroidering altar-cloths.  There was a brightness in the room that seemed in no other inthe house, and the lingering essences in the air of it were as incense toher.  In secrecy she even busied herself with keeping things in betterorder than Rebecca, Mistress Clorinda\'s woman, had ever had time to dobefore.  She also contrived to get into her own hands some duties thatwere Rebecca\'s own.  She could mend lace cleverly and arrangeriband-knots with taste, and even change the fashion of a gown.  The hard-worked tirewoman was but too glad to be relieved, and kept her secretwell, being praised many times for the set or fashion of a thing intowhich she had not so much as set a needle.  Being a shrewd baggage, shewas wise enough always to relate to Anne the story of her mistress\'spleasure, having the wit to read in her delight that she would beencouraged to fresh effort.At times it so befell that, when Anne went into the bed-chamber, shefound the beauty there, who, if she chanced to be in the humour, woulddetain her in her presence for a space and bewitch her over again.  Insooth, it seemed that she took a pleasure in showing her female adorerhow wondrously full of all fascinations she could be.  At such timesAnne\'s plain face would almost bloom with excitement, and her shotpheasant\'s eyes would glow as if beholding a goddess.She neither saw nor heard more of the miniature on the riband.  It usedto make her tremble at times to fancy that by some strange chance itmight still be under the bed, and that the handsome face smiled and theblue eyes gazed in the very apartment where she herself sat and hersister was robed and disrobed in all her beauty.She used all her modest skill in fitting to her own shape andrefurnishing the cast-off bits of finery bestowed upon her.  It was allset to rights long before Clorinda recalled to mind that she had promisedthat Anne should sometime see her chance visitors take their dish of teawith her.But one day, for some cause, she did remember, and sent for her.Anne ran to her bed-chamber and donned her remodelled gown with shakinghands.  She laughed a little hysterically as she did it, seeing her plainsnub-nosed face in the glass.  She tried to dress her head in a fashionnew to her, and knew she did it ill and untidily, but had no time tochange it.  If she had had some red she would have put it on, but suchvanities were not in her chamber or Barbara\'s.  So she rubbed her cheekshard, and even pinched them, so that in the end they looked as if theywere badly rouged.  It seemed to her that her nose grew red too, andindeed \'twas no wonder, for her hands and feet were like ice.""She must be ashamed of me,"" the humble creature said to herself.  ""Andif she is ashamed she will be angered and send me away and be friends nomore.""She did not deceive herself, poor thing, and imagine she had the chanceof being regarded with any great lenience if she appeared ill.""Mistress Clorinda begged that you would come quickly,"" said Rebecca,knocking at the door.So she caught her handkerchief, which was scented, as all her garmentswere, with dried rose-leaves from the garden, which she had conservedherself, and went down to the chintz parlour trembling.It was a great room with white panels, and flowered coverings to thefurniture.  There were a number of ladies and gentlemen standing talkingand laughing loudly together.  The men outnumbered the women, and most ofthem stood in a circle about Mistress Clorinda, who sat upright in agreat flowered chair, smiling with her mocking, stately air, as if shedefied them to dare to speak what they felt.Anne came in like a mouse.  Nobody saw her.  She did not, indeed, knowwhat to do.  She dared not remain standing all alone, so she crept to theplace where her sister\'s chair was, and stood a little behind its highback.  Her heart beat within her breast till it was like to choke her.They were only country gentlemen who made the circle, but to her theyseemed dashing gallants.  That some of them had red noses as well ascheeks, and that their voices were big and their gallantries boisterous,was no drawback to their manly charms, she having seen no other finergentlemen.  They were specimens of the great conquering creature Man,whom all women must aspire to please if they have the fortunate power;and each and all of them were plainly trying to please Clorinda, and notshe them.And so Anne gazed at them with admiring awe, waiting until there shouldcome a pause in which she might presume to call her sister\'s attention toher presence; but suddenly, before she had indeed made up her mind howshe might best announce herself, there spoke behind her a voice ofsilver.""It is only goddesses,"" said the voice, ""who waft about them as they movethe musk of the rose-gardens of Araby.  When you come to reign over us intown, Madam, there will be no perfume in the mode but that ofrose-leaves, and in all drawing-rooms we shall breathe but theirperfume.""And there, at her side, was bowing, in cinnamon and crimson, withjewelled buttons on his velvet coat, the beautiful being whose fair locksthe sun had shone on the morning she had watched him ride away--the manwhom the imperial beauty had dismissed and called a popinjay.Clorinda looked under her lashes towards him without turning, but in sodoing beheld Anne standing in waiting.""A fine speech lost,"" she said, ""though \'twas well enough for thecountry, Sir John.  \'Tis thrown away, because \'tis not I who am scentedwith rose-leaves, but Anne there, whom you must not ogle.  Come hither,sister, and do not hide as if you were ashamed to be looked at.""And she drew her forward, and there Anne stood, and all of them stared ather poor, plain, blushing face, and the Adonis in cinnamon and crimsonbowed low, as if she had been a duchess, that being his conqueror\'s waywith gentle or simple, maid, wife, or widow, beauty or homespununcomeliness.It was so with him always; he could never resist the chance of luring tohimself a woman\'s heart, whether he wanted it or not, and he had a charm,a strange and wonderful one, it could not be denied.  Anne palpitatedindeed as she made her curtsey to him, and wondered if Heaven had everbefore made so fine a gentleman and so beautiful a being.She went but seldom to this room again, and when she went she stoodalways in the background, far more in fear that some one would addressher than that she should meet with neglect.  She was used to neglect, andto being regarded as a nonentity, and aught else discomfited her.  Allher pleasure was to hear what was said, though \'twas not always of thefinest wit--and to watch Clorinda play the queen among her admirers andher slaves.  She would not have dared to speak of Sir John Oxonfrequently--indeed, she let fall his name but rarely; but she learned acurious wit in contriving to hear all things concerning him.  It was herhabit cunningly to lead Mistress Margery to talking about him andrelating long histories of his conquests and his grace.  Mistress Wimpoleknew many of them, having, for a staid and prudent matron, a livelyinterest in his ways.  It seemed, truly--if one must believe her long-winded stories--that no duchess under seventy had escaped weeping for himand losing rest, and that ladies of all ranks had committed follies forhis sake.Mistress Anne, having led her to this fruitful subject, would sit andlisten, bending over her embroidery frame with strange emotions, causingher virgin breast to ache with their swelling.  She would lie awake atnight thinking in the dark, with her heart beating.  Surely, surely therewas no other man on earth who was so fitted to Clorinda, and to whom itwas so suited that this empress should give her charms.  Surely no woman,however beautiful or proud, could dismiss his suit when he pressed it.And then, poor woman, her imagination strove to paint the splendour oftheir mutual love, though of such love she knew so little.  But it must,in sooth, be bliss and rapture; and perchance, was her humble thought,she might see it from afar, and hear of it.  And when they went to court,and Clorinda had a great mansion in town, and many servants who needed ahousewife\'s eye upon their doings to restrain them from wastefulness andriot, might it not chance to be that if she served well now, and had thecourage to plead with her then, she might be permitted to serve herthere, living quite apart in some quiet corner of the house.  And thenher wild thoughts would go so far that she would dream--reddening at herown boldness--of a child who might be born to them, a lordly infant sonand heir, whose eyes might be blue and winning, and his hair in greatfair locks, and whom she might nurse and tend and be a slave to--andlove--and love--and love, and who might end by knowing she was his tenderservant, always to be counted on, and might look at her with that wooing,laughing glance, and even love her too.The night Clorinda laid her commands upon Mistress Wimpole concerning thecoming of Sir John Oxon, that matron, after receiving them, hurried toher other charges, flurried and full of talk, and poured forth her wonderand admiration at length.""She is a wondrous lady!"" she said--""she is indeed!  It is not alone herbeauty, but her spirit and her wit.  Mark you how she sees all things andlets none pass, and can lay a plan as prudent as any lady old enough tobe twice her mother.  She knows all the ways of the world of fashion, andwill guard herself against gossip in such a way that none can gainsay herhigh virtue.  Her spirit is too great to allow that she may even _seem_to be as the town ladies.  She will not have it!  Sir John will not findhis court easy to pay.  She will not allow that he shall be able to sayto any one that he has seen her alone a moment.  Thus, she says, hecannot boast.  If all ladies were as wise and cunning, there would be notales to tell.""  She talked long and garrulously, and set forth to themhow Mistress Clorinda had looked straight at her with her black eyes,until she had almost shaken as she sat, because it seemed as though shedared her to disobey her will; and how she had sat with her hair trailingupon the floor over the chair\'s back, and at first it had seemed that shewas flushed with anger, but next as if she had smiled.""Betimes,"" said Mistress Wimpole, ""I am afraid when she smiles, but to-night some thought had crossed her mind that pleased her.  I think it wasthat she liked to think that he who has conquered so many ladies willfind that he is to be outwitted and made a mock of.  She likes thatothers shall be beaten if she thinks them impudent.  She liked it as achild, and would flog the stable-boys with her little whip until theyknelt to beg her pardon for their freedoms.""That night Mistress Anne went to her bed-chamber with her head full ofwandering thoughts, and she had not the power to bid them dispersethemselves and leave her--indeed, she scarce wished for it.  She wasthinking of Clorinda, and wondering sadly that she was of so high a pridethat she could bear herself as though there were no human weakness in herbreast, not even the womanly weakness of a heart.  How could it bepossible that she could treat with disdain this gallant gentleman, if heloved her, as he surely must?  Herself she had been sure that she hadseen an ardent flame in his blue eyes, even that first day when he hadbowed to her with that air of grace as he spoke of the fragrance of therose leaves he had thought wafted from her robe.  How could a woman whomhe loved resist him?  How could she cause him to suffer by forcing him tostand at arm\'s length when he sighed to draw near and breathe his passionat her feet?In the silence of her chamber as she disrobed, she sighed with restlesspain, but did not know that her sighing was for grief that love--of whichthere seemed so little in some lives--could be wasted and flung away.  Shecould not fall into slumber when she lay down upon her pillow, but tossedfrom side to side with a burdened heart.""She is so young and beautiful and proud,"" she thought.  ""It is because Iam so much older that I can see these things--that I see that this issurely the one man who should be her husband.  There may be many others,but they are none of them her equals, and she would scorn and hate themwhen she was once bound to them for life.  This one is as beautiful asshe--and full of grace, and wit, and spirit.  She could not look downupon him, however wrath she was at any time.  Ah me!  She should notspurn him, surely she should not!""She was so restless and ill at ease that she could not lie upon her bed,but rose therefrom, as she often did in her wakeful hours, and went toher lattice, gently opening it to look out upon the night, and calmherself by sitting with her face uplifted to the stars, which from herchildhood she had fancied looked down upon her kindly and as if theywould give her comfort.To-night there were no stars.  There should have been a moonthree-quarters full, but, in the evening, clouds had drifted across thesky and closed over all heavily, so that no moonlight was to be seen,save when a rare sudden gust made a ragged rent, for a moment, in theblackness.She did not sit this time, but knelt, clad in her night-rail as she was.All was sunk into the profoundest silence of the night.  By this time theentire household had been long enough abed to be plunged in sleep.  Shealone was waking, and being of that simple mind which, like a child\'s,must ever bear its trouble to a protecting strength, she looked up at thedarkness of the cloudy sky and prayed for the better fortune of the manwho had indeed not remembered her existence after the moment he had madeher his obeisance.  She was too plain and sober a creature to beremembered.""Perchance,"" she murmured, ""he is at this moment also looking at theclouds from his window, because he cannot sleep for thinking that in twodays he will be beneath her father\'s roof and will see her loveliness,and he must needs be contriving within his mind what he will say, if shedo but look as if she might regard him with favour, which I pray shewill.""From the path below, that moment there rose a slight sound, so slight aone that for a moment she thought she must have been deceived inbelieving it had fallen upon her ear.  All was still after it for fulltwo minutes, and had she heard no more she would have surely forgottenshe had heard aught, or would have believed herself but the victim offancy.  But after the long pause the same sound came again, though thistime it was slighter; yet, despite its slightness, it seemed to her to bethe crushing of the earth and stone beneath a cautious foot.  It was afoot so cautious that it was surely stealthy and scarce dared to advanceat all.  And then all was still again.  She was for a moment overcomewith fears, not being of a courageous temper, and having heard, but oflate, of a bold gipsy vagabond who, with a companion, had broken into thelower rooms of a house of the neighbourhood, and being surprised by itsowner, had only been overcome and captured after a desperate fight, inwhich shots were exchanged, and one of the hurriedly-awakened servantskilled.  So she leaned forward to hearken further, wondering what sheshould do to best alarm the house, and, as she bent so, she heard thesound again and a smothered oath, and with her straining eyes saw thatsurely upon the path there stood a dark-draped figure.  She rose withgreat care to her feet, and stood a moment shaking and clinging to thewindow-ledge, while she bethought her of what servants she could wakefirst, and how she could reach her father\'s room.  Her poor heart beat inher side, and her breath came quickly.  The soundlessness of the nightwas broken by one of the strange sudden gusts of wind which tossed thetrees, and tore at the clouds as they hurried.  She heard the footstepsagain, as if it feared its own sound the less when the wind might coverit.  A faint pale gleam showed between two dark clouds behind which themoon had been hidden; it grew brighter, and a jagged rent was torn, sothat the moon herself for a second or so shone out dazzling bright beforethe clouds rushed over her again and shut her in.It was at this very instant Mistress Anne heard the footsteps once more,and saw full well a figure in dark cloak and hat which stepped quicklyinto the shade of a great tree.  But more she saw--and clapped her handupon her mouth to stifle the cry that would have otherwise risen in spiteof her--that notwithstanding his fair locks were thrust out of sightbeneath his hat, and he looked strange and almost uncomely, it was theface of Sir John Oxon, the moon, bursting through the jagged clouds, hadshone upon.']"
78,9,Chapter 9,"['VIII--Two meet in the deserted rose garden, and the old Earl ofDunstanwolde is made a happy manIt was not until three days later, instead of two, that Sir John Oxonrode into the courtyard with his servant behind him.  He had beendetained on his journey, but looked as if his impatience had not causedhim to suffer, for he wore his finest air of spirit and beauty, and whenhe was alone with Sir Jeoffry, made his compliments to the absent ladies,and inquired of their health with his best town grace.Mistress Clorinda did not appear until the dining hour, when she sweptinto the room like a queen, followed by her sister, Anne, and MistressWimpole, this being the first occasion of Mistress Anne\'s dining, as itwere, in state with her family.The honour had so alarmed her, that she looked pale, and so ugly that SirJeoffry scowled at sight of her, and swore under his breath to Clorindathat she should have been allowed to come.""I know my own affairs the best, by your leave, sir,"" answered Clorinda,as low and with a grand flash of her eye.  ""She hath been drilled well.""This she had indeed, and so had Mistress Wimpole, and throughout Sir JohnOxon\'s stay they were called upon to see that they played well theirparts.  Two weeks he stayed and then rode gaily back to town, and whenClorinda made her sweeping curtsey to the ground to him upon thethreshold of the flowered room in which he bade her farewell, both Anneand Mistress Wimpole curtseyed a step behind her.""Now that he has gone and you have shown me that you can attend me as Iwish,"" she said, turning to them as the sound of his horse\'s hoofs diedaway, ""it will not trouble me should he choose some day to come again.  Hehas not carried with him much that he can boast of.""In truth, it seemed to the outer world that she had held him well inhand.  If he had come as a sighing lover, the whole county knew she hadshown him but small favour.  She had invited companies to the house onseveral occasions, and all could see how she bore herself towards him.She carried herself with a certain proud courtesy as becoming thedaughter of his host, but her wit did not spare him, and sometimes whenit was more than in common cutting he was seen to wince though he heldhimself gallantly.  There were one or two who thought they now and thenhad seen his blue eyes fall upon her when he believed none were looking,and rest there burningly for a moment, but \'twas never for more than aninstant, when he would rouse himself with a start and turn away.She had been for a month or two less given to passionate outbreaks,having indeed decided that it was to her interest as a young lady and afuture great one to curb herself.  Her tirewoman, Rebecca, had begun todare to breathe more freely when she was engaged about her person, andhad, in truth, spoken of her pleasanter fortune among her fellows in theservants\' hall.But a night or two after the visitor took his departure, she gave way tosuch an outburst as even Rebecca had scarce ever beheld, being roused toit by a small thing in one sense, though in yet another perhaps greatenough, since it touched upon the despoiling of one of her beauties.She was at her toilet-table being prepared for the night, and her longhair brushed and dressed before retiring.  Mistress Wimpole had come into the chamber to do something at her bidding, and chancing to standgazing at her great and heavy fall of locks as she was waiting, sheobserved a thing which caused her, foolish woman that she was, to give astart and utter an unwise exclamation.""Madam!"" she gasped--""madam!""""What then!"" quoth Mistress Clorinda angrily.  ""You bring my heart to mythroat!""""Your hair!"" stammered Wimpole, losing all her small wit--""your beauteoushair!  A lock is gone, madam!""Clorinda started to her feet, and flung the great black mass over herwhite shoulder, that she might see it in the glass.""Gone!"" she cried.  ""Where?  How?  What mean you?  Ah-h!""Her voice rose to a sound that was well-nigh a scream.  She saw therifled spot--a place where a great lock had been severed jaggedly--and itmust have been five feet long.She turned and sprang upon her woman, her beautiful face distorted withfury, and her eyes like flames of fire.  She seized her by each shoulderand boxed her ears until her head spun round and bells rang within it.""\'Twas you!"" she shrieked.  ""\'Twas you--she-devil-beast--slut that youare!  \'Twas when you used your scissors to the new head you made for me.You set it on my hair that you might set a loop--and in your sluttish wayyou snipped a lock by accident and hid it from me.""She beat her till her own black hair flew about her like the mane of afury; and having used her hands till they were tired, she took her brushfrom the table and beat her with that till the room echoed with the blowson the stout shoulders.""Mistress, \'twas not so!"" cried the poor thing, sobbing and struggling.""\'Twas not so, madam!""""Madam, you will kill the woman,"" wept Mistress Wimpole.  ""I beseechyou--!  \'Tis not seemly, I beseech--""Mistress Clorinda flung her woman from her and threw the brush atMistress Wimpole, crying at her with the lordly rage she had been wont toshriek with when she wore breeches.""Damnation to thy seemliness!"" she cried, ""and to thee too!  Get theegone--from me, both--get thee gone from my sight!""And both women fled weeping, and sobbing, and gasping from the roomincontinently.She was shrewish and sullen with her woman for days after, and it was thepoor creature\'s labour to keep from her sight, when she dressed her head,the place from whence the lock had been taken.  In the servants\' hall thewoman vowed that it was not she who had cut it, that she had had noaccident, though it was true she had used the scissors about her head,yet it was but in snipping a ribbon, and she had not touched a hair.""If she were another lady,"" she said, ""I should swear some gallant hadrobbed her of it; but, forsooth, she does not allow them to come nearenough for such sport, and with five feet of hair wound up in coronals,how could a man unwind a lock, even if \'twas permitted him to stand ather very side.""Two years passed, and the beauty had no greater fields to conquer thanthose she found in the country, since her father, Sir Jeoffry, had notthe money to take her to town, he becoming more and more involved and sofallen into debt that it was even whispered that at times it went hardwith him to keep even the poor household he had.Mistress Clorinda\'s fortunes the gentry of the neighbourhood discussedwith growing interest and curiosity.  What was like to become of hergreat gifts and powers in the end, if she could never show them to thegreat world, and have the chance to carry her splendid wares to thefashionable market where there were men of quality and wealth who wouldbe like to bid for them.  She had not chosen to accept any of those whohad offered themselves so far, and it was believed that for some reasonshe had held off my lord of Dunstanwolde in his suit.  \'Twas evident thathe admired her greatly, and why he had not already made her his countesswas a sort of mystery which was productive of many discussions and boremuch talking over.  Some said that, with all her beauty and hisadmiration, he was wary and waited, and some were pleased to say that thereason he waited was because the young lady herself contrived that heshould, it being her desire to make an open conquest of Sir John Oxon,and show him to the world as her slave, before she made up her mind tomake even a much greater match.  Some hinted that for all herdisdainfulness and haughty pride she would marry Sir John if he askedher, but that he being as brilliant a beau as she a beauty, he was toofond of his pleasures and his gay town life to give them up even to agoddess who had no fortune.  His own had not been a great one, and he hadsquandered it magnificently, his extravagances being renowned in theworld of fashion, and having indeed founded for him his reputation.It was, however, still his way to accept frequent hospitalities from hiskinsman Eldershawe, and Sir Jeoffry was always rejoiced enough to securehim as his companion for a few days when he could lure him from thedissipation of the town.  At such times it never failed that MistressWimpole and poor Anne kept their guard.  Clorinda never allowed them torelax their vigilance, and Mistress Wimpole ceased to feel afraid, andbecame accustomed to her duties, but Anne never did so.  She lookedalways her palest and ugliest when Sir John was in the house, and shewould glance with sad wonder and timid adoration from him to Clorinda;but sometimes when she looked at Sir John her plain face would growcrimson, and once or twice he caught her at the folly, and when shedropped her eyes overwhelmed with shame, he faintly smiled to himself,seeing in her a new though humble conquest.There came a day when in the hunting-field there passed from mouth tomouth a rumour, and Sir Jeoffry, hearing it, came pounding over on hisbig black horse to his daughter and told it to her in great spirits.""He is a sly dog, John Oxon,"" he said, a broad grin on his rubicund face.""This very week he comes to us, and he and I are cronies, yet he hasblabbed nothing of what is being buzzed about by all the world.""""He has learned how to keep a closed mouth,"" said Mistress Clorinda,without asking a question.""But \'tis marriage he is so mum about, bless ye!"" said Sir Jeoffry.  ""Andthat is not a thing to be hid long.  He is to be shortly married, theysay.  My lady, his mother, has found him a great fortune in a new beautybut just come to town.  She hath great estates in the West Indies, aswell as a fine fortune in England--and all the world is besieging her;but Jack hath come and bowed sighing before her, and writ some verses,and borne her off from them all.""""\'Tis time,"" said Clorinda, ""that he should marry some woman who can payhis debts and keep him out of the spunging house, for to that he willcome if he does not play his cards with skill.""Sir Jeoffry looked at her askance and rubbed his red chin.""I wish thou hadst liked him, Clo,"" he said, ""and ye had both hadfortunes to match.  I love the fellow, and ye would have made a handsomepair.""Mistress Clorinda laughed, sitting straight in her saddle, her fine eyesunblenching, though the sun struck them.""We had fortunes to match,"" she said--""I was a beggar and he was aspendthrift.  Here comes Lord Dunstanwolde.""And as the gentleman rode near, it seemed to his dazzled eyes that thesun so shone down upon her because she was a goddess and drew it from theheavens.In the west wing of the Hall \'twas talked of between Mistress Wimpole andher charges, that a rumour of Sir John Oxon\'s marriage was afloat.""Yet can I not believe it,"" said Mistress Margery; ""for if ever agentleman was deep in love, though he bitterly strove to hide it, \'twasSir John, and with Mistress Clorinda.""""But she,"" faltered Anne, looking pale and even agitated--""she was alwaysdisdainful to him and held him at arm\'s length.  I--I wished she wouldhave treated him more kindly.""""\'Tis not her way to treat men kindly,"" said Mistress Wimpole.But whether the rumour was true or false--and there were those whobestowed no credit upon it, and said it was mere town talk, and that thesame things had been bruited abroad before--it so chanced that Sir Johnpaid no visit to his relative or to Sir Jeoffry for several months.  \'Twasheard once that he had gone to France, and at the French Court was makingas great a figure as he had made at the English one, but of this even hiskinsman Lord Eldershawe could speak no more certainly than he could ofthe first matter.The suit of my Lord of Dunstanwolde--if suit it was--during these monthsappeared to advance somewhat.  All orders of surmises were madeconcerning it--that Mistress Clorinda had privately quarrelled with SirJohn and sent him packing; that he had tired of his love-making, as \'twaswell known he had done many times before, and having squandered hispossessions and finding himself in open straits, must needs patch up hisfortunes in a hurry with the first heiress whose estate suited him.  But\'twas the women who said these things; the men swore that no man couldtire of or desert such spirit and beauty, and that if Sir John Oxonstayed away \'twas because he had been commanded to do so, it never havingbeen Mistress Clorinda\'s intention to do more than play with him awhile,she having been witty against him always for a fop, and meaning herselfto accept no man as a husband who could not give her both rank andwealth.""We know her,"" said the old boon companions of her childhood, as theytalked of her over their bottles.  ""She knew her price and would bargainfor it when she was not eight years old, and would give us songs andkisses but when she was paid for them with sweet things and knickknacksfrom the toy-shops.  She will marry no man who cannot make her at least acountess, and she would take him but because there was not a duke athand.  We know her, and her beauty\'s ways.""But they did not know her; none knew her, save herself.In the west wing, which grew more bare and ill-furnished as things woreout and time went by, Mistress Anne waxed thinner and paler.  She was sothin in two months\' time, that her soft, dull eyes looked twice theirnatural size, and seemed to stare piteously at people.  One day, indeed,as she sat at work in her sister\'s room, Clorinda being there at thetime, the beauty, turning and beholding her face suddenly, uttered aviolent exclamation.""Why look you at me so?"" she said.  ""Your eyes stand out of your headlike a new-hatched, unfeathered bird\'s.  They irk me with their strangeasking look.  Why do you stare at me?""""I do not know,"" Anne faltered.  ""I could not tell you, sister.  My eyesseem to stare so because of my thinness.  I have seen them in my mirror.""""Why do you grow thin?"" quoth Clorinda harshly.  ""You are not ill.""""I--I do not know,"" again Anne faltered.  ""Naught ails me.  I do notknow.  For--forgive me!""Clorinda laughed.""Soft little fool,"" she said, ""why should you ask me to forgive you?  Imight as fairly ask you to forgive _me_, that I keep my shape and show nowasting.""Anne rose from her chair and hurried to her sister\'s side, sinking uponher knees there to kiss her hand.""Sister,"" she said, ""one could never dream that you could need pardon.  Ilove you so--that all you do, it seems to me must be right--whatsoever itmight be.""Clorinda drew her fair hands away and clasped them on the top of herhead, proudly, as if she crowned herself thereby, her great and splendideyes setting themselves upon her sister\'s face.""All that I do,"" she said slowly, and with the steadfast high arroganceof an empress\' self--""All that I do _is_ right--for me.  I make it so bydoing it.  Do you think that I am conquered by the laws that other womencrouch and whine before, because they dare not break them, though theylong to do so?  _I_ am my own law--and the law of some others.""It was by this time the first month of the summer, and to-night there wasagain a birth-night ball, at which the beauty was to dazzle all eyes; but\'twas of greater import than the one she had graced previously, it beingto celebrate the majority of the heir to an old name and estate, who hadbeen orphaned early, and was highly connected, counting, indeed, amongthe members of his family the Duke of Osmonde, who was one of the richestand most envied nobles in Great Britain, his dukedom being of the oldest,his numerous estates the most splendid and beautiful, and the longhistory of his family full of heroic deeds.  This nobleman was also adistant kinsman to the Earl of Dunstanwolde, and at this ball, for thefirst time for months, Sir John Oxon appeared again.He did not arrive on the gay scene until an hour somewhat late.  Butthere was one who had seen him early, though no human soul had known ofthe event.In the rambling, ill-cared for grounds of Wildairs Hall there was an oldrose-garden, which had once been the pride and pleasure of some lady ofthe house, though this had been long ago; and now it was but a lonelywilderness where roses only grew because the dead Lady Wildairs had lovedthem, and Barbara and Anne had tended them, and with their own handsplanted and pruned during their childhood and young maiden days.  But oflate years even they had seemed to have forgotten it, having becomediscouraged, perchance, having no gardeners to do the rougher work, andthe weeds and brambles so running riot.  There were high hedges andwinding paths overgrown and run wild; the stronger rose-bushes grew intangled masses, flinging forth their rich blooms among the weeds; such aswere more delicate, struggling to live among them, became more frail andscant-blossoming season by season; a careless foot would have troddenthem beneath it as their branches grew long and trailed in the grass; butfor many months no foot had trodden there at all, and it was a beauteousplace deserted.In the centre was an ancient broken sun-dial, which was in these days inthe midst of a sort of thicket, where a bold tangle of the finest redroses clambered, and, defying neglect, flaunted their rich colour in thesun.And though the place had been so long forgotten, and it was not thecustom for it to be visited, about this garlanded broken sun-dial thegrass was a little trodden, and on the morning of the young heir\'s comingof age some one stood there in the glowing sunlight as if waiting.This was no less than Mistress Clorinda herself.  She was clad in amorning gown of white, which seemed to make of her more than ever a tall,transcendent creature, less a woman than a conquering goddess; and shehad piled the dial with scarlet red roses, which she was choosing toweave into a massive wreath or crown, for some purpose best known toherself.  Her head seemed haughtier and more splendidly held on high eventhan was its common wont, but upon these roses her lustrous eyes weredowncast and were curiously smiling, as also was her ripe, arching lip,whose scarlet the blossoms vied with but poorly.  It was a smile likethis, perhaps, which Mistress Wimpole feared and trembled before, for\'twas not a tender smile nor a melting one.  If she was waiting, she didnot wait long, nor, to be sure, would she have long waited if she hadbeen kept by any daring laggard.  This was not her way.\'Twas not a laggard who came soon, stepping hurriedly with light feetupon the grass, as though he feared the sound which might be made if hehad trodden upon the gravel.  It was Sir John Oxon who came towards herin his riding costume.He came and stood before her on the other side of the dial, and made hera bow so low that a quick eye might have thought \'twas almost mocking.His feather, sweeping the ground, caught a fallen rose, which clung toit.  His beauty, when he stood upright, seemed to defy the very morning\'sself and all the morning world; but Mistress Clorinda did not lift hereyes, but kept them upon her roses, and went on weaving.""Why did you choose to come?"" she asked.""Why did you choose to keep the tryst in answer to my message?"" hereplied to her.At this she lifted her great shining eyes and fixed them full upon him.""I wished,"" she said, ""to hear what you would say--but more to _see_ youthan to hear.""""And I,"" he began--""I came--""She held up her white hand with a long-stemmed rose in it--as though aqueen should lift a sceptre.""You came,"" she answered, ""more to see _me_ than to hear.  You made thatblunder.""""You choose to bear yourself like a goddess, and disdain me from Olympianheights,"" he said.  ""I had the wit to guess it would be so.""She shook her royal head, faintly and most strangely smiling.""That you had not,"" was her clear-worded answer.  ""That is a laterthought sprung up since you have seen my face.  \'Twas quick--for you--butnot quick enough.""  And the smile in her eyes was maddening.  ""Youthought to see a woman crushed and weeping, her beauty bent before you,her locks dishevelled, her streaming eyes lifted to Heaven--and you--withprayers, swearing that not Heaven could help her so much as your deigningmagnanimity.  You have seen women do this before, you would have seen_me_ do it--at your feet--crying out that I was lost--lost for ever._That_ you expected!  \'Tis not here.""Debauched as his youth was, and free from all touch of heart orconscience--for from his earliest boyhood he had been the pupil of rakesand fashionable villains--well as he thought he knew all women and theirways, betraying or betrayed--this creature taught him a new thing, a newmood in woman, a new power which came upon him like a thunderbolt.""Gods!"" he exclaimed, catching his breath, and even falling back apace,""Damnation! you are _not_ a woman!""She laughed again, weaving her roses, but not allowing that his eyesshould loose themselves from hers.""But now, you called me a goddess and spoke of Olympian heights,"" shesaid; ""I am not one--I am a woman who would show other women how to bearthemselves in hours like these.  Because I am a woman why should I kneel,and weep, and rave?  What have I lost--in losing you?  I should have lostthe same had I been twice your wife.  What is it women weep and beattheir breasts for--because they love a man--because they lose his love.They never have them.""She had finished the wreath, and held it up in the sun to look at it.What a strange beauty was hers, as she held it so--a heavy, sumptuousthing--in her white hands, her head thrown backward.""You marry soon,"" she asked--""if the match is not broken?""""Yes,"" he answered, watching her--a flame growing in his eyes and in hissoul in his own despite.""It cannot be too soon,"" she said.  And she turned and faced him, holdingthe wreath high in her two hands poised like a crown above her head--thebrilliant sun embracing her, her lips curling, her face uplifted as ifshe turned to defy the light, the crimson of her cheek.  \'Twas as if fromfoot to brow the woman\'s whole person was a flame, rising and burningtriumphant high above him.  Thus for one second\'s space she stood,dazzling his very eyesight with her strange, dauntless splendour; andthen she set the great rose-wreath upon her head, so crowning it.""You came to see me,"" she said, the spark in her eyes growing to the sizeof a star; ""I bid you look at me--and see how grief has faded me thesepast months, and how I am bowed down by it.  Look well--that you mayremember.""""I look,"" he said, almost panting.""Then,"" she said, her fine-cut nostril pinching itself with her breath,as she pointed down the path before her--""_go_!--back to your kennel!""* * * * *That night she appeared at the birth-night ball with the wreath of roseson her head.  No other ladies wore such things, \'twas a fashion of herown; but she wore it in such beauty and with such state that it became acrown again even as it had been the first moment that she had put it on.All gazed at her as she entered, and a murmur followed her as she movedwith her father up the broad oak staircase which was known through allthe country for its width and massive beauty.  In the hall below guestswere crowded, and there were indeed few of them who did not watch her asshe mounted by Sir Jeoffry\'s side.  In the upper hall there were guestsalso, some walking to and fro, some standing talking, many looking downat the arrivals as they came up.""\'Tis Mistress Wildairs,"" these murmured as they saw her.  ""Clorinda, byGod!"" said one of the older men to his crony who stood near him.  ""Andcrowned with roses!  The vixen makes them look as if they were built ofrubies in every leaf.""At the top of the great staircase there stood a gentleman, who had indeedpaused a moment, spellbound, as he saw her coming.  He was a man ofunusual height and of a majestic mien; he wore a fair periwig, whichadded to his tallness; his laces and embroiderings were marvels of artand richness, and his breast blazed with orders.  Strangely, she did notseem to see him; but when she reached the landing, and her face wasturned so that he beheld the full blaze of its beauty, \'twas so great awonder and revelation to him that he gave a start.  The next momentalmost, one of the red roses of her crown broke loose from its fasteningsand fell at his very feet.  His countenance changed so that it seemedalmost, for a second, to lose some of its colour.  He stooped and pickedthe rose up and held it in his hand.  But Mistress Clorinda was lookingat my Lord of Dunstanwolde, who was moving through the crowd to greether.  She gave him a brilliant smile, and from her lustrous eyes surelythere passed something which lit a fire of hope in his.After she had made her obeisance to her entertainers, and her birthdaygreetings to the young heir, he contrived to draw closely to her side andspeak a few words in a tone those near her could not hear.""To-night, madam,"" he said, with melting fervour, ""you deign to bring memy answer as you promised.""""Yes,"" she murmured.  ""Take me where we may be a few moments alone.""He led her to an antechamber, where they were sheltered from the gaze ofthe passers-by, though all was moving gaiety about them.  He fell uponhis knee and bowed to kiss her fair hand.  Despite the sobriety of hisyears, he was as eager and tender as a boy.""Be gracious to me, madam,"" he implored.  ""I am not young enough to wait.Too many months have been thrown away.""""You need wait no longer, my lord,"" she said--""not one single hour.""And while he, poor gentleman, knelt, kissing her hand with adoringhumbleness, she, under the splendour of her crown of roses, gazed down athis grey-sprinkled head with her great steady shining orbs, as if gazingat some almost uncomprehended piteous wonder.In less than an hour the whole assemblage knew of the event and talked ofit.  Young men looked daggers at Dunstanwolde and at each other; andolder men wore glum or envious faces.  Women told each other \'twas asthey had known it would be, or \'twas a wonder that at last it had comeabout.  Upon the arm of her lord that was to be, Mistress Clorinda passedfrom room to room like a royal bride.As she made her first turn of the ballroom, all eyes upon her, her beautyblazing at its highest, Sir John Oxon entered and stood at the door.  Hewore his gallant air, and smiled as ever; and when she drew near him hebowed low, and she stopped, and bent lower in a curtsey sweeping theground.\'Twas but in the next room her lord led her to a gentleman who stood witha sort of court about him.  It was the tall stranger, with the fairperiwig, and the orders glittering on his breast--the one who had startedat sight of her as she had reached the landing of the stairs.  He heldstill in his hand a broken red rose, and when his eye fell on her crownthe colour mounted to his cheek.""My honoured kinsman, his Grace the Duke of Osmonde,"" said her affiancedlord.  ""Your Grace--it is this lady who is to do me the great honour ofbecoming my Lady Dunstanwolde.""And as the deep, tawny brown eye of the man bending before her flashedinto her own, for the first time in her life Mistress Clorinda\'s lidsfell, and as she swept her curtsey of stately obeisance her heart strucklike a hammer against her side.']"
78,10,Chapter 10,"['IX--""I give to him the thing he craves with all his soul--myself""In a month she was the Countess of Dunstanwolde, and reigned in herlord\'s great town house with a retinue of servants, her powdered lackeysamong the tallest, her liveries and equipages the richest the world offashion knew.  She was presented at the Court, blazing with theDunstanwolde jewels, and even with others her bridegroom had bought inhis passionate desire to heap upon her the magnificence which became herso well.  From the hour she knelt to kiss the hand of royalty she set thetown on fire.  It seemed to have been ordained by Fate that her passagethrough this world should be always the triumphant passage of aconqueror.  As when a baby she had ruled the servants\' hall, the kennel,and the grooms\' quarters, later her father and his boisterous friends,and from her fifteenth birthday the whole hunting shire she lived in, soshe held her sway in the great world, as did no other lady of her rank orany higher.  Those of her age seemed but girls yet by her side, whethermarried or unmarried, and howsoever trained to modish ways.  She was butscarce eighteen at her marriage, but she was no girl, nor did she lookone, glowing as was the early splendour of her bloom.  Her height was farbeyond the ordinary for a woman; but her shape so faultless and hercarriage so regal, that though there were men upon whom she was tallenough to look down with ease, the beholder but felt that her tallnesswas an added grace and beauty with which all women should have beenendowed, and which, as they were not, caused them to appear butinsignificant.  What a throat her diamonds blazed on, what shoulders andbosom her laces framed, on what a brow her coronet sat and glittered.  Herlord lived as \'twere upon his knees in enraptured adoration.  Since hisfirst wife\'s death in his youth, he had dwelt almost entirely in thecountry at his house there, which was fine and stately, but had been keptgloomily half closed for a decade.  His town establishment had, in truth,never been opened since his bereavement; and now--an elderly man--hereturned to the gay world he had almost forgotten, with a bride whoseyouth and beauty set it aflame.  What wonder that his head almost reeledat times and that he lost his breath before the sum of his strange latebliss, and the new lease of brilliant life which seemed to have beengiven to him.In the days when, while in the country, he had heard such rumours of thelawless days of Sir Jeoffry Wildairs\' daughter, when he had heard of herdauntless boldness, her shrewish temper, and her violent passions, he hadbeen awed at the thought of what a wife such a woman would make for agentleman accustomed to a quiet life, and he had indeed striven hard torestrain the desperate admiration he was forced to admit she had inspiredin him even at her first ball.The effort had, in sooth, been in vain, and he had passed many asleepless night; and when, as time went on, he beheld her again andagain, and saw with his own eyes, as well as heard from others, of thegreat change which seemed to have taken place in her manners andcharacter, he began devoutly to thank Heaven for the alteration, as for amerciful boon vouchsafed to him.  He had been wise enough to know thateven a stronger man than himself could never conquer or rule her; andwhen she seemed to begin to rule herself and bear herself as befitted herbirth and beauty, he had dared to allow himself to dream of whatperchance might be if he had great good fortune.In these days of her union with him, he was, indeed, almost humbly amazedat the grace and kindness she showed him every hour they passed in eachother\'s company.  He knew that there were men, younger and handsomer thanhimself, who, being wedded to beauties far less triumphant than she,found that their wives had but little time to spare them from the world,which knelt at their feet, and that in some fashion they themselvesseemed to fall into the background.  But \'twas not so with this woman,powerful and worshipped though she might be.  She bore herself with thehigh dignity of her rank, but rendered to him the gracious respect anddeference due both to his position and his merit.  She stood by his sideand not before him, and her smiles and wit were bestowed upon him asgenerously as to others.  If she had once been a vixen, she was surely sono longer, for he never heard a sharp or harsh word pass her lips, thoughit is true her manner was always somewhat imperial, and her lacqueys andwaiting women stood in greatest awe of her.  There was that in herpresence and in her eye before which all commoner or weaker creaturesquailed.  The men of the world who flocked to pay their court to her, andthe popinjays who followed them, all knew this look, and a tone in herrich voice which could cut like a knife when she chose that it should doso.  But to my Lord of Dunstanwolde she was all that a worshipped ladycould be.""Your ladyship has made of me a happier man than I ever dared to dream ofbeing, even when I was but thirty,"" he would say to her, with reverentdevotion.  ""I know not what I have done to deserve this late summer whichhath been given me.""""When I consented to be your wife,"" she answered once, ""I swore to myselfthat I would make one for you;"" and she crossed the hearth to where hesat--she was attired in all her splendour for a Court ball, and starredwith jewels--bent over his chair and placed a kiss upon his grizzledhair.Upon the night before her wedding with him, her sister, Mistress Anne,had stolen to her chamber at a late hour.  When she had knocked upon thedoor, and had been commanded to enter, she had come in, and closing thedoor behind her, had stood leaning against it, looking before her, withher eyes wide with agitation and her poor face almost grey.All the tapers for which places could be found had been gatheredtogether, and the room was a blaze of light.  In the midst of it, beforeher mirror, Clorinda stood attired in her bridal splendour of white satinand flowing rich lace, a diamond crescent on her head, sparks of lightflaming from every point of her raiment.  When she caught sight of Anne\'sreflection in the glass before her, she turned and stood staring at herin wonder.""What--nay, what is this?"" she cried.  ""What do you come for?  On mysoul, you come for something--or you have gone mad.""Anne started forward, trembling, her hands clasped upon her breast, andfell at her feet with sobs.""Yes, yes,"" she gasped, ""I came--for something--to speak--to pray you--!Sister--Clorinda, have patience with me--till my courage comes again!""and she clutched her robe.Something which came nigh to being a shudder passed through MistressClorinda\'s frame; but it was gone in a second, and she touchedAnne--though not ungently--with her foot, withdrawing her robe.""Do not stain it with your tears,"" she said, ""\'twould be a bad omen.""Anne buried her face in her hands and knelt so before her.""\'Tis not too late!"" she said--""\'tis not too late yet.""""For what?"" Clorinda asked.  ""For what, I pray you tell me, if you canfind your wits.  You go beyond my patience with your folly.""""Too late to stop,"" said Anne--""to draw back and repent.""""What?"" commanded Clorinda--""what then should I repent me?""""This marriage,"" trembled Mistress Anne, taking her poor hands from herface to wring them.  ""It should not be.""""Fool!"" quoth Clorinda.  ""Get up and cease your grovelling.  Did you cometo tell me it was not too late to draw back and refuse to be the Countessof Dunstanwolde?"" and she laughed bitterly.""But it should not be--it must not!"" Anne panted.  ""I--I know, sister, Iknow--""Clorinda bent deliberately and laid her strong, jewelled hand on hershoulder with a grasp like a vice.  There was no hurry in her movement orin her air, but by sheer, slow strength she forced her head backward sothat the terrified woman was staring in her face.""Look at me,"" she said.  ""I would see you well, and be squarely lookedat, that my eyes may keep you from going mad.  You have pondered overthis marriage until you have a frenzy.  Women who live alone aresometimes so, and your brain was always weak.  What is it that you know.Look--in my eyes--and tell me.""It seemed as if her gaze stabbed through Anne\'s eyes to the very centreof her brain.  Anne tried to bear it, and shrunk and withered; she wouldhave fallen upon the floor at her feet a helpless, sobbing heap, but thewhite hand would not let her go.""Find your courage--if you have lost it--and speak plain words,"" Clorindacommanded.  Anne tried to writhe away, but could not again, and burstinto passionate, hopeless weeping.""I cannot--I dare not!"" she gasped.  ""I am afraid.  You are right; mybrain is weak, and I--but that--that gentleman--who so loved you--""""Which?"" said Clorinda, with a brief scornful laugh.""The one who was so handsome--with the fair locks and the gallant air--""""The one you fell in love with and stared at through the window,"" saidClorinda, with her brief laugh again.  ""John Oxon!  He has victimsenough, forsooth, to have spared such an one as you are.""""But he loved you!"" cried Anne piteously, ""and it must have been thatyou--you too, sister--or--or else--""  She choked again with sobs, andClorinda released her grasp upon her shoulder and stood upright.""He wants none of me--nor I of him,"" she said, with strange sternness.""We have done with one another.  Get up upon your feet if you would nothave me thrust you out into the corridor.""She turned from her, and walking back to her dressing-table, stood theresteadying the diadem on her hair, which had loosed a fastening when Annetried to writhe away from her.  Anne half sat, half knelt upon the floor,staring at her with wet, wild eyes of misery and fear.""Leave your kneeling,"" commanded her sister again, ""and come here.""Anne staggered to her feet and obeyed her behest.  In the glass she couldsee the resplendent reflection; but Clorinda did not deign to turntowards her while she addressed her, changing the while the brilliants inher hair.""Hark you, sister Anne,"" she said.  ""I read you better than you think.You are a poor thing, but you love me and--in my fashion--I think I loveyou somewhat too.  You think I should not marry a gentleman whom youfancy I do not love as I might a younger, handsomer man.  You are full oflove, and spinster dreams of it which make you flighty.  I love my Lordof Dunstanwolde as well as any other man, and better than some, for I donot hate him.  He has a fine estate, and is a gentleman--and worships me.Since I have been promised to him, I own I have for a moment seen anothergentleman who _might_--but \'twas but for a moment, and \'tis done with.\'Twas too late then.  If we had met two years agone \'twould not have beenso.  My Lord Dunstanwolde gives to me wealth, and rank, and life atCourt.  I give to him the thing he craves with all his soul--myself.  Itis an honest bargain, and I shall bear my part of it with honesty.  Ihave no virtues--where should I have got them from, forsooth, in a lifelike mine?  I mean I have no women\'s virtues; but I have one that issometimes--not always--a man\'s.  \'Tis that I am not a coward and atrickster, and keep my word when \'tis given.  You fear that I shall leadmy lord a bitter life of it.  \'Twill not be so.  He shall live smoothly,and not suffer from me.  What he has paid for he shall honestly have.  Iwill not cheat him as weaker women do their husbands; for he pays--poorgentleman--he pays.""And then, still looking at the glass, she pointed to the doorway throughwhich her sister had come, and in obedience to her gesture of command,Mistress Anne stole silently away.']"
78,11,Chapter 11,"['X--""Yes--I have marked him""Through the brilliant, happy year succeeding to his marriage my Lord ofDunstanwolde lived like a man who dreams a blissful dream and knows it isone.""I feel,"" he said to his lady, ""as if \'twere too great rapture to last,and yet what end could come, unless you ceased to be kind to me; and, intruth, I feel that you are too noble above all other women to change,unless I were more unworthy than I could ever be since you are mine.""Both in the town and in the country, which last place heard many thingsof his condition and estate through rumour, he was the man most wonderedat and envied of his time--envied because of his strange happiness;wondered at because having, when long past youth, borne off this arrogantbeauty from all other aspirants she showed no arrogance to him, and wasas perfect a wife as could have been some woman without gifts whom he hadlifted from low estate and endowed with rank and fortune.  She seemedboth to respect himself and her position as his lady and spouse.  Hermanner of reigning in his household was among his many delights thegreatest.  It was a great house, and an old one, built long before by aDunstanwolde whose lavish feasts and riotous banquets had been thenotable feature of his life.  It was curiously rambling in its structure.The rooms of entertainment were large and splendid, the halls andstaircases stately; below stairs there was space for an army of servantsto be disposed of; and its network of cellars and wine-vaults was sobeyond all need that more than one long arched stone passage was shut upas being without use, and but letting cold, damp air into corridorsleading to the servants\' quarters.  It was, indeed, my Lady Dunstanwoldewho had ordered the closing of this part when it had been her pleasure tobe shown her domain by her housekeeper, the which had greatly awed andimpressed her household as signifying that, exalted lady as she was, herwit was practical as well as brilliant, and that her eyes being open toher surroundings, she meant not that her lacqueys should rob her and herscullions filch, thinking that she was so high that she was ignorant ofcommon things and blind.""You will be well housed and fed and paid your dues,"" she said to them;""but the first man or woman who does a task ill or dishonestly will beturned from his place that hour.  I deal justice--not mercy.""""Such a mistress they have never had before,"" said my lord when sherelated this to him.  ""Nay, they have never dreamed of such a lady--onewho can be at once so severe and so kind.  But there is none other such,my dearest one.  They will fear and worship you.""She gave him one of her sweet, splendid smiles.  It was the sweetness sheat rare times gave her splendid smile which was her marvellous power.""I would not be too grand a lady to be a good housewife,"" she said.  ""Imay not order your dinners, my dear lord, or sweep your corridors, butthey shall know I rule your household and would rule it well.""""You are a goddess!"" he cried, kneeling to her, enraptured.  ""And youhave given yourself to a poor mortal man, who can but worship you.""""You give me all I have,"" she said, ""and you love me nobly, and I amgrateful.""Her assemblies were the most brilliant in the town, and the most to bedesired entrance to.  Wits and beauties planned and intrigued that theymight be bidden to her house; beaux and fine ladies fell into the spleenif she neglected them.  Her lord\'s kinsman the Duke of Osmonde, who hadbeen present when she first knelt to Royalty, had scarce removed his eyesfrom her so long as he could gaze.  He went to Dunstanwolde afterwardsand congratulated him with stately courtesy upon his great good fortuneand happiness, speaking almost with fire of her beauty and majesty, andthanking his kinsman that through him such perfections had been given totheir name and house.  From that time, at all special assemblies given byhis kinsman he was present, the observed of all observers.  He was a manof whom \'twas said that he was the most magnificent gentleman in Europe;that there was none to compare with him in the combination of gifts givenboth by Nature and Fortune.  His beauty both of feature and carriage wasof the greatest, his mind was of the highest, and his education farbeyond that of the age he lived in.  It was not the fashion of the daythat men of his rank should devote themselves to the cultivation of theirintellects instead of to a life of pleasure; but this he had done fromhis earliest youth, and now, in his perfect though early maturity, he hadno equal in polished knowledge and charm of bearing.  He was the patronof literature and art; men of genius were not kept waiting in hisantechamber, but were received by him with courtesy and honour.  At theCourt \'twas well known there was no man who stood so near the throne infavour, and that there was no union so exalted that he might not havemade his suit as rather that of a superior than an equal.  The Queen bothloved and honoured him, and condescended to avow as much with graciousfrankness.  She knew no other man, she deigned to say, who was so worthyof honour and affection, and that he had not married must be becausethere was no woman who could meet him on ground that was equal.  If therewere no scandals about him--and there were none--\'twas not because he wascold of heart or imagination.  No man or woman could look into his deepeye and not know that when love came to him \'twould be a burning passion,and an evil fate if it went ill instead of happily.""Being past his callow, youthful days, \'tis time he made some woman aduchess,"" Dunstanwolde said reflectively once to his wife.  ""\'Twould bemore fitting that he should; and it is his way to honour his house in allthings, and bear himself without fault as the head of it.  Methinks itstrange he makes no move to do it.""""No, \'tis not strange,"" said my lady, looking under her black-fringedlids at the glow of the fire, as though reflecting also.  ""There is nostrangeness in it.""""Why not?"" her lord asked.""There is no mate for him,"" she answered slowly.  ""A man like him mustmate as well as marry, or he will break his heart with silent raging atthe weakness of the thing he is tied to.  He is too strong and splendidfor a common woman.  If he married one, \'twould be as if a lion had takento himself for mate a jackal or a sheep.  Ah!"" with a long drawnbreath--""he would go mad--mad with misery;"" and her hands, which lay uponher knee, wrung themselves hard together, though none could see it.""He should have a goddess, were they not so rare,"" said Dunstanwolde,gently smiling.  ""He should hold a bitter grudge against me, that I, hisunworthy kinsman, have been given the only one.""""Yes, he should have a goddess,"" said my lady slowly again; ""and thereare but women, naught but women.""""You have marked him well,"" said her lord, admiring her wisdom.  ""Methinksthat you--though you have spoken to him but little, and have but of latebecome his kinswoman--have marked and read him better than the rest ofus.""""Yes--I have marked him,"" was her answer.""He is a man to mark, and I have a keen eye.""  She rose up as she spoke,and stood before the fire, lifted by some strong feeling to her fullestheight, and towering there, splendid in the shadow--for \'twas by twilightthey talked.  ""He is a Man,"" she said--""he is a Man!  Nay, he is as Godmeant man should be.  And if men were so, there would be women greatenough for them to mate with and to give the world men like them.""  Andbut that she stood in the shadow, her lord would have seen the crimsontorrent rush up her cheek and brow, and overspread her long round throatitself.If none other had known of it, there was one man who knew that she hadmarked him, though she had borne herself towards him always with herstateliest grace.  This man was his Grace the Duke himself.  From thehour that he had stood transfixed as he watched her come up the broad oakstair, from the moment that the red rose fell from her wreath at hisfeet, and he had stooped to lift it in his hand, he had seen her as noother man had seen her, and he had known that had he not come but justtoo late, she would have been his own.  Each time he had beheld her sincethat night he had felt this burn more deeply in his soul.  He was toohigh and fine in all his thoughts to say to himself that in her he sawfor the first time the woman who was his peer; but this was very truth--ormight have been, if Fate had set her youth elsewhere, and a lady who wasnoble and her own mother had trained and guarded her.  When he saw her atthe Court surrounded, as she ever was, by a court of her own; when he sawher reigning in her lord\'s house, receiving and doing gracious honour tohis guests and hers; when she passed him in her coach, drawing every eyeby the majesty of her presence, as she drove through the town, he felt adeep pang, which was all the greater that his honour bade him conquer it.He had no ignoble thought of her, he would have scorned to sully his soulwith any light passion; to him she was the woman who might have been hisbeloved wife and duchess, who would have upheld with him the honour andtraditions of his house, whose strength and power and beauty would havebeen handed down to his children, who so would have been born endowedwith gifts befitting the state to which Heaven had called them.  It wasof this he thought when he saw her, and of naught less like to do herhonour.  And as he had marked her so, he saw in her eyes, despite herdignity and grace, she had marked him.  He did not know how closely, orthat she gave him the attention he could not restrain himself frombestowing upon her.  But when he bowed before her, and she greeted himwith all courtesy, he saw in her great, splendid eye that had Fate willedit so, she would have understood all his thoughts, shared all hisambitions, and aided him to uphold his high ideals.  Nay, he knew sheunderstood him even now, and was stirred by what stirred him also, eventhough they met but rarely, and when they encountered each other, spokebut as kinsman and kinswoman who would show each other all graciousrespect and honour.  It was because of this pang which struck his greatheart at times that he was not a frequent visitor at my LordDunstanwolde\'s mansion, but appeared there only at such assemblies aswere matters of ceremony, his absence from which would have been a notedthing.  His kinsman was fond of him, and though himself of so much riperage, honoured him greatly.  At times he strove to lure him into visits ofgreater familiarity; but though his kindness was never met coldly orrepulsed, a further intimacy was in some gracious way avoided.""My lady must beguile you to be less formal with us,"" said Dunstanwolde.And later her ladyship spoke as her husband had privately desired: ""Mylord would be made greatly happy if your Grace would honour our houseoftener,"" she said one night, when at the end of a great ball he wasbidding her adieu.Osmonde\'s deep eye met hers gently and held it.  ""My Lord Dunstanwolde isalways gracious and warm of heart to his kinsman,"" he replied.  ""Do notlet him think me discourteous or ungrateful.  In truth, your ladyship, Iam neither the one nor the other.""The eyes of each gazed into the other\'s steadfastly and gravely.  TheDuke of Osmonde thought of Juno\'s as he looked at hers; they were of suchvelvet, and held such fathomless deeps.""Your Grace is not so free as lesser men,"" Clorinda said.  ""You cannotcome and go as you would.""""No,"" he answered gravely, ""I cannot, as I would.""And this was all.It having been known by all the world that, despite her beauty and herconquests, Mistress Clorinda Wildairs had not smiled with great favourupon Sir John Oxon in the country, it was not wondered at or made anymatter of gossip that the Countess of Dunstanwolde was but littlefamiliar with him and saw him but rarely at her house in town.Once or twice he had appeared there, it is true, at my LordDunstanwolde\'s instance, but my lady herself scarce seemed to see himafter her first courtesies as hostess were over.""You never smiled on him, my love,"" Dunstanwolde said to his wife.  ""Youbore yourself towards him but cavalierly, as was your ladyship\'s way--withall but one poor servant,"" tenderly; ""but he was one of the many whofollowed in your train, and if these gay young fellows stay away, \'twillbe said that I keep them at a distance because I am afraid of their youthand gallantry.  I would not have it fancied that I was so ungrateful asto presume upon your goodness and not leave to you your freedom.""""Nor would I, my lord,"" she answered.  ""But he will not come often; I donot love him well enough.""His marriage with the heiress who had wealth in the West Indies wasbroken off, or rather \'twas said had come to naught.  All the town knewit, and wondered, and talked, because it had been believed at first thatthe young lady was much enamoured of him, and that he would soon lead herto the altar, the which his creditors had greatly rejoiced over aspromising them some hope that her fortune would pay their bills of whichthey had been in despair.  Later, however, gossip said that the heiresshad not been so tender as was thought; that, indeed, she had been foundto be in love with another man, and that even had she not, she had heardsuch stories of Sir John as promised but little nuptial happiness for anywoman that took him to husband.When my Lord Dunstanwolde brought his bride to town, and she soared atonce to splendid triumph and renown, inflaming every heart, and settingevery tongue at work, clamouring her praises, Sir John Oxon saw her fromafar in all the scenes of brilliant fashion she frequented and reignedqueen of.  \'Twas from afar, it might be said, he saw her only, though hewas often near her, because she bore herself as if she did not observehim, or as though he were a thing which did not exist.  The first timethat she deigned to address him was upon an occasion when she foundherself standing so near him at an assembly that in the crowd she brushedhim with her robe.  His blue eyes were fixed burningly upon her, and asshe brushed him he drew in a hard breath, which she hearing, turnedslowly and let her own eyes fall upon his face.""You did not marry,"" she said.""No, I did not marry,"" he answered, in a low, bitter voice.  ""\'Twas yourladyship who did that.""She faintly, slowly smiled.""I should not have been like to do otherwise,"" she said; ""\'tis anhonourable condition.  I would advise you to enter it.""']"
78,12,Chapter 12,"['XI--Wherein a noble life comes to an endWhen the earl and his countess went to their house in the country, therefell to Mistress Anne a great and curious piece of good fortune.  In herwildest dreams she had never dared to hope that such a thing might be.My Lady Dunstanwolde, on her first visit home, bore her sister back withher to the manor, and there established her.  She gave her a suite ofrooms and a waiting woman of her own, and even provided her with asuitable wardrobe.  This last she had chosen herself with a taste andfitness which only such wit as her own could have devised.""They are not great rooms I give thee, Anne,"" she said, ""but quiet andsmall ones, which you can make home-like in such ways as I know yourtaste lies.  My lord has aided me to choose romances for your shelves, heknowing more of books than I do.  And I shall not dress thee out like apeacock with gay colours and great farthingales.  They would frightenthee, poor woman, and be a burden with their weight.  I have chosen suchthings as are not too splendid, but will suit thy pale face and shotpartridge eyes.""Anne stood in the middle of her room and looked about at its comforts,wondering.""Sister,"" she said, ""why are you so good to me?  What have I done toserve you?  Why is it Anne instead of Barbara you are so gracious to?""""Perchance because I am a vain woman and would be worshipped as youworship me.""""But you are always worshipped,"" Anne faltered.""Ay, by men!"" said Clorinda, mocking; ""but not by women.  And it may bethat my pride is so high that I must be worshipped by a woman too.  Youwould always love me, sister Anne.  If you saw me break the law--if yousaw me stab the man I hated to the heart, you would think it must bepardoned to me.""She laughed, and yet her voice was such that Anne lost her breath andcaught at it again.""Ay, I should love you, sister!"" she cried.  ""Even then I could not butlove you.  I should know you could not strike so an innocent creature,and that to be so hated he must have been worthy of hate.  You--are notlike other women, sister Clorinda; but you could not be base--for youhave a great heart.""Clorinda put her hand to her side and laughed again, but with lessmocking in her laughter.""What do you know of my heart, Anne?"" she said.  ""Till late I did notknow it beat, myself.  My lord says \'tis a great one and noble, but Iknow \'tis his own that is so.  Have I done honestly by him, Anne, as Itold you I would?  Have I been fair in my bargain--as fair as an honestman, and not a puling, slippery woman?""""You have been a great lady,"" Anne answered, her great dull, soft eyesfilling with slow tears as she gazed at her.  ""He says that you havegiven to him a year of Heaven, and that you seem to him like somearchangel--for the lower angels seem not high enough to set beside you.""""\'Tis as I said--\'tis his heart that is noble,"" said Clorinda.  ""But Ivowed it should be so.  He paid--he paid!""The country saw her lord\'s happiness as the town had done, and wonderedat it no less.  The manor was thrown open, and guests came down fromtown; great dinners and balls being given, at which all the country sawthe mistress reign at her consort\'s side with such a grace as no ladyever had worn before.  Sir Jeoffry, appearing at these assemblies, was soamazed that he forgot to muddle himself with drink, in gazing at hisdaughter and following her in all her movements.""Look at her!"" he said to his old boon companions and hers, who were asmuch awed as he.  ""Lord! who would think she was the strapping, handsomeshrew that swore, and sang men\'s songs to us, and rode to the hunt inbreeches.""He was awed at the thought of paying fatherly visits to her house, andwould have kept away, but that she was kind to him in the way he was bestable to understand.""I am country-bred, and have not the manners of your town men, my lady,""he said to her, as he sat with her alone on one of the first mornings hespent with her in her private apartment.  ""I am used to rap out an oathor an ill-mannered word when it comes to me.  Dunstanwolde has weaned youof hearing such things--and I am too old a dog to change.""""Wouldst have thought I was too old to change,"" answered she, ""but I wasnot.  Did I not tell thee I would be a great lady?  There is naught a manor woman cannot learn who hath the wit.""""Thou hadst it, Clo,"" said Sir Jeoffry, gazing at her with a sort of slowwonder.  ""Thou hadst it.  If thou hadst not--!""  He paused, and shook hishead, and there was a rough emotion in his coarse face.  ""I was not theman to have made aught but a baggage of thee, Clo.  I taught thee naughtdecent, and thou never heard or saw aught to teach thee.  Damn me!""almost with moisture in his eyes, ""if I know what kept thee from going toruin before thou wert fifteen.""She sat and watched him steadily.""Nor I,"" quoth she, in answer.  ""Nor I--but here thou seest me, Dad--anearl\'s lady, sitting before thee.""""\'Twas thy wit,"" said he, still moved, and fairly maudlin.  ""\'Twas thywit and thy devil\'s will!""""Ay,"" she answered, ""\'twas they--my wit and my devil\'s will!""She rode to the hunt with him as she had been wont to do, but she worethe latest fashion in hunting habit and coat; and though \'twould not havebeen possible for her to sit her horse better than of old, or to takehedges and ditches with greater daring and spirit, yet in some way everyman who rode with her felt that \'twas a great lady who led the field.  Thehorse she rode was a fierce, beauteous devil of a beast which Sir Jeoffryhimself would scarce have mounted even in his younger days; but shecarried her loaded whip, and she sat upon the brute as if she scarcelyfelt its temper, and held it with a wrist of steel.My Lord Dunstanwolde did not hunt this season.  He had never been greatlyfond of the sport, and at this time was a little ailing, but he would notlet his lady give up her pleasure because he could not join it.""Nay,"" he said, ""\'tis not for the queen of the hunting-field to stay athome to nurse an old man\'s aches.  My pride would not let it be so.  Yourfather will attend you.  Go--and lead them all, my dear.""In the field appeared Sir John Oxon, who for a brief visit was atEldershawe.  He rode close to my lady, though she had naught to say tohim after her first greetings of civility.  He looked not as fresh andglowing with youth as had been his wont only a year ago.  His recklesswildness of life and his town debaucheries had at last touched his bloom,perhaps.  He had a haggard look at moments when his countenance was notlighted by excitement.  \'Twas whispered that he was deep enough in debtto be greatly straitened, and that his marriage having come to naught hiscreditors were besetting him without mercy.  This and more than this, noone knew so well as my Lady Dunstanwolde; but of a certainty she hadlittle pity for his evil case, if one might judge by her face, when inthe course of the running he took a hedge behind her, and pressing hishorse, came up by her side and spoke.""Clorinda,"" he began breathlessly, through set teeth.She could have left him and not answered, but she chose to restrain thepace of her wild beast for a moment and look at him.""\'Your ladyship!\'"" she corrected his audacity.  ""Or--\'my LadyDunstanwolde.\'""""There was a time""--he said.""This morning,"" she said, ""I found a letter in a casket in my closet.  Ido not know the mad villain who wrote it.  I never knew him.""""You did not,"" he cried, with an oath, and then laughed scornfully.""The letter lies in ashes on the hearth,"" she said.  ""\'Twas burnedunopened.  Do not ride so close, Sir John, and do not play the madman andthe beast with the wife of my Lord Dunstanwolde.""""\'The wife!\'"" he answered.  ""\'My lord!\'  \'Tis a new game this, and wellplayed, by God!""She did not so much as waver in her look, and her wide eyes smiled.""Quite new,"" she answered him--""quite new.  And could I not have playedit well and fairly, I would not have touched the cards.  Keep your horseoff, Sir John.  Mine is restive, and likes not another beast near him;""and she touched the creature with her whip, and he was gone like athunderbolt.The next day, being in her room, Anne saw her come from herdressing-table with a sealed letter in her hand.  She went to the belland rang it.""Anne,"" she said, ""I am going to rate my woman and turn her from myservice.  I shall not beat or swear at her as I was wont to do with mywomen in time past.  You will be afraid, perhaps; but you must stay withme.""She was standing by the fire with the letter held almost at arm\'s lengthin her finger-tips, when the woman entered, who, seeing her face, turnedpale, and casting her eyes upon the letter, paler still, and began toshake.""You have attended mistresses of other ways than mine,"" her lady said inher slow, clear voice, which seemed to cut as knives do.  ""Some fool andmadman has bribed you to serve him.  You cannot serve me also.  Comehither and put this in the fire.  If \'twere to be done I would make youhold it in the live coals with your hand.""The woman came shuddering, looking as if she thought she might be struckdead.  She took the letter and kneeled, ashen pale, to burn it.  When\'twas done, her mistress pointed to the door.""Go and gather your goods and chattels together, and leave within thishour,"" she said.  ""I will be my own tirewoman till I can find one whocomes to me honest.""When she was gone, Anne sat gazing at the ashes on the hearth.  She waspale also.""Sister,"" she said, ""do you--""""Yes,"" answered my lady.  ""\'Tis a man who loved me, a cur and a knave.  Hethought for an hour he was cured of his passion.  I could have told him\'twould spring up and burn more fierce than ever when he saw another manpossess me.  \'Tis so with knaves and curs; and \'tis so with him.  He hathgone mad again.""""Ay, mad!"" cried Anne--""mad, and base, and wicked!""Clorinda gazed at the ashes, her lips curling.""He was ever base,"" she said--""as he was at first, so he is now.  \'Tisthy favourite, Anne,"" lightly, and she delicately spurned the blackenedtinder with her foot--""thy favourite, John Oxon.""Mistress Anne crouched in her seat and hid her face in her thin hands.""Oh, my lady!"" she cried, not feeling that she could say ""sister,"" ""if hebe base, and ever was so, pity him, pity him!  The base need pity morethan all.""For she had loved him madly, all unknowing her own passion, not presumingeven to look up in his beautiful face, thinking of him only as the slaveof her sister, and in dead secrecy knowing strange things--strangethings!  And when she had seen the letter she had known the handwriting,and the beating of her simple heart had well-nigh strangled her--for shehad seen words writ by him before.* * * * *When Dunstanwolde and his lady went back to their house in town, MistressAnne went with them.  Clorinda willed that it should be so.  She made herthere as peaceful and retired a nest of her own as she had given to herat Dunstanwolde.  By strange good fortune Barbara had been wedded to aplain gentleman, who, being a widower with children, needed a help-meetin his modest household, and through a distant relationship to MistressWimpole, encountered her charge, and saw in her meekness of spirit thething which might fall into the supplying of his needs.  A beauty or afine lady would not have suited him; he wanted but a housewife and amother for his orphaned children, and this, a young woman who had livedstraitly, and been forced to many contrivances for mere decency ofapparel and ordinary comfort, might be trained to become.So it fell that Mistress Anne could go to London without pangs ofconscience at leaving her sister in the country and alone.  Thestateliness of the town mansion, my Lady Dunstanwolde\'s retinue oflacqueys and serving-women, her little black page, who waited on her andtook her pug dogs to walk, her wardrobe, and jewels, and equipages, wereeach and all marvels to her, but seemed to her mind so far befitting thatshe remembered, wondering, the days when she had darned the tatteredtapestry in her chamber, and changed the ribbands and fashions of hergowns.  Being now attired fittingly, though soberly as became her, shewas not in these days--at least, as far as outward seeming went--anawkward blot upon the scene when she appeared among her sister\'s company;but at heart she was as timid and shrinking as ever, and never mingledwith the guests in the great rooms when she could avoid so doing.  Onceor twice she went forth with Clorinda in her coach and six, and saw theglittering world, while she drew back into her corner of the equipage andgazed with all a country-bred woman\'s timorous admiration.""\'Twas grand and like a beautiful show!"" she said, when she came home thefirst time.  ""But do not take me often, sister; I am too plain and shy,and feel that I am naught in it.""But though she kept as much apart from the great World of Fashion as shecould, she contrived to know of all her sister\'s triumphs; to see herwhen she went forth in her bravery, though \'twere but to drive in theMall; to be in her closet with her on great nights when her tirewomenwere decking her in brocades and jewels, that she might show her highestbeauty at some assembly or ball of State.  And at all these times, asalso at all others, she knew that she but shared her own love and dazzledadmiration with my Lord Dunstanwolde, whose tenderness, being so fed byhis lady\'s unfailing graciousness of bearing and kindly looks and words,grew with every hour that passed.They held one night a splendid assembly at which a member of the RoyalHouse was present.  That night Clorinda bade her sister appear.""Sometimes--I do not command it always--but sometimes you must showyourself to our guests.  My lord will not be pleased else.  He says it isnot fitting that his wife\'s sister should remain unseen as if we hid heraway through ungraciousness.  Your woman will prepare for you all thingsneedful.  I myself will see that your dress becomes you.  I havecommanded it already, and given much thought to its shape and colour.  Iwould have you very comely, Anne.""  And she kissed her lightly on hercheek--almost as gently as she sometimes kissed her lord\'s grey hair.  Intruth, though she was still a proud lady and stately in her ways, therehad come upon her some strange subtle change Anne could not understand.On the day on which the assembly was held, Mistress Anne\'s woman broughtto her a beautiful robe.  \'Twas flowered satin of the sheen and softnessof a dove\'s breast, and the lace adorning it was like a spider\'s web forgossamer fineness.  The robe was sweetly fashioned, fitting her shapewondrously; and when she was attired in it at night a little colour cameinto her cheeks to see herself so far beyond all comeliness she had everknown before.  When she found herself in the midst of the dazzling scenein the rooms of entertainment, she was glad when at last she could feelherself lost among the crowd of guests.  Her only pleasure in such sceneswas to withdraw to some hidden corner and look on as at a pageant or aplay.  To-night she placed herself in the shadow of a screen, from whichretreat she could see Clorinda and Dunstanwolde as they received theirguests.  Thus she found enjoyment enough; for, in truth, her love andalmost abject passion of adoration for her sister had grown as hislordship\'s had, with every hour.  For a season there had rested upon hera black shadow beneath which she wept and trembled, bewildered and lost;though even at its darkest the object of her humble love had been a starwhose brightness was not dimmed, because it could not be so whatsoeverpassed before it.  This cloud, however, being it seemed dispelled, thestar had shone but more brilliant in its high place, and she the morepassionately worshipped it.  To sit apart and see her idol\'s radiance, tomark her as she reigned and seemed the more royal when she bent the kneeto royalty itself, to see the shimmer of her jewels crowning her midnighthair and crashing the warm whiteness of her noble neck, to observe theadmiration in all eyes as they dwelt upon her--this was, indeed, enoughof happiness.""She is, as ever,"" she murmured, ""not so much a woman as a proud lovelygoddess who has deigned to descend to earth.  But my lord does not looklike himself.  He seems shrunk in the face and old, and his eyes haverings about them.  I like not that.  He is so kind a gentleman and sohappy that his body should not fail him.  I have marked that he haslooked colourless for days, and Clorinda questioned him kindly on it, buthe said he suffered naught.""\'Twas but a little later than she had thought this, that she remarked agentleman step aside and stand quite near without observing her.  Feelingthat she had no testimony to her fancifulness, she found herself thinkingin a vague fashion that he, too, had come there because he chose to beunobserved.  \'Twould not have been so easy for him to retire as it hadbeen for her smallness and insignificance to do so; and, indeed, she didnot fancy that he meant to conceal himself, but merely to stand for aquiet moment a little apart from the crowd.And as she looked up at him, wondering why this should be, she saw he wasthe noblest and most stately gentleman she had ever beheld.She had never seen him before; he must either be a stranger or a rarevisitor.  As Clorinda was beyond a woman\'s height, he was beyond a man\'s.He carried himself as kingly as she did nobly; he had a countenance ofstrong, manly beauty, and a deep tawny eye, thick-fringed and full offire; orders glittered upon his breast, and he wore a fair periwig, whichbecame him wondrously, and seemed to make his eye more deep and burningby its contrast.Beside his strength and majesty of bearing the stripling beauty of JohnOxon would have seemed slight and paltry, a thing for flippant women totrifle with.Mistress Anne looked at him with an admiration somewhat like reverence,and as she did so a sudden thought rose to her mind, and even as it rose,she marked what his gaze rested on, and how it dwelt upon it, and knewthat he had stepped apart to stand and gaze as she did--only with a man\'shid fervour--at her sister\'s self.\'Twas as if suddenly a strange secret had been told her.  She read it inhis face, because he thought himself unobserved, and for a space had casthis mask aside.  He stood and gazed as a man who, starving at soul, fedhimself through his eyes, having no hope of other sustenance, or as a manweary with long carrying of a burden, for a space laid it down for restand to gather power to go on.  She heard him draw a deep sigh almoststifled in its birth, and there was that in his face which she felt itwas unseemly that a stranger like herself should behold, himselfunknowing of her near presence.She gently rose from her corner, wondering if she could retire from herretreat without attracting his observation; but as she did so, chancecaused him to withdraw himself a little farther within the shadow of thescreen, and doing so, he beheld her.Then his face changed; the mask of noble calmness, for a moment fallen,resumed itself, and he bowed before her with the reverence of a courtlygentleman, undisturbed by the unexpectedness of his recognition of herneighbourhood.""Madam,"" he said, ""pardon my unconsciousness that you were near me.  Youwould pass?""  And he made way for her.She curtseyed, asking his pardon with her dull, soft eyes.""Sir,"" she answered, ""I but retired here for a moment\'s rest from thethrong and gaiety, to which I am unaccustomed.  But chiefly I sat inretirement that I might watch--my sister.""""Your sister, madam?"" he said, as if the questioning echo were almostinvoluntary, and he bowed again in some apology.""My Lady Dunstanwolde,"" she replied.  ""I take such pleasure in herloveliness and in all that pertains to her, it is a happiness to me tobut look on.""Whatsoever the thing was in her loving mood which touched him and foundecho in his own, he was so far moved that he answered to her withsomething less of ceremoniousness; remembering also, in truth, that shewas a lady he had heard of, and recalling her relationship and name.""It is then Mistress Anne Wildairs I am honoured by having speech with,""he said.  ""My Lady Dunstanwolde has spoken of you in my presence.  I ammy lord\'s kinsman the Duke of Osmonde;"" again bowing, and Anne curtseyedlow once more.Despite his greatness, she felt a kindness and grace in him which was notcondescension, and which almost dispelled the timidity which, being partof her nature, so unduly beset her at all times when she addressed or wasaddressed by a stranger.  John Oxon, bowing his bright curls, and seemingever to mock with his smiles, had caused her to be overcome with shyawkwardness and blushes; but this man, who seemed as far above him inperson and rank and mind as a god is above a graceful painted puppet,even appeared to give of his own noble strength to her poor weakness.  Hebore himself towards her with a courtly respect such as no human beinghad ever shown to her before.  He besought her again to be seated in hernook, and stood before her conversing with such delicate sympathy withher mood as seemed to raise her to the pedestal on which stood lesshumble women.  All those who passed before them he knew and could speakeasily of.  The high deeds of those who were statesmen, or men honouredat Court or in the field, he was familiar with; and of those who werebeauties or notable gentlewomen he had always something courtly to say.Her own worship of her sister she knew full well he understood, though hespoke of her but little.""Well may you gaze at her,"" he said.  ""So does all the world, and honoursand adores.""He proffered her at last his arm, and she, having strangely takencourage, let him lead her through the rooms and persuade her to somerefreshment.  Seeing her so wondrously emerge from her chrysalis, andunder the protection of so distinguished a companion, all looked at heras she passed with curious amazement, and indeed Mistress Anne was allbut overpowered by the reverence shown them as they made their way.As they came again into the apartment wherein the host and hostessreceived their guests, Anne felt her escort pause, and looked up at himto see the meaning of his sudden hesitation.  He was gazing intently, notat Clorinda, but at the Earl of Dunstanwolde.""Madam,"" he said, ""pardon me that I seem to detain you, but--but I lookat my kinsman.  Madam,"" with a sudden fear in his voice, ""he is ailing--hesways as he stands.  Let us go to him.  Quickly!  He falls!""And, in sooth, at that very moment there arose a dismayed cry from theguests about them, and there was a surging movement; and as they pressedforward themselves through the throng, Anne saw Dunstanwolde no moreabove the people, for he had indeed fallen and lay outstretched anddeathly on the floor.\'Twas but a few seconds before she and Osmonde were close enough to himto mark his fallen face and ghastly pallor, and a strange dew startingout upon his brow.But \'twas his wife who knelt beside his prostrate body, waving all elseaside with a great majestic gesture of her arm.""Back! back!"" she cried.  ""Air! air! and water!  My lord!  My dear lord!""But he did not answer, or even stir, though she bent close to him andthrust her hand within his breast.  And then the frightened guests behelda strange but beautiful and loving thing, such as might have moved anyheart to tenderness and wonder.  This great beauty, this worshippedcreature, put her arms beneath and about the helpless, awful body--for soits pallor and stillness indeed made it--and lifted it in their powerfulwhiteness as if it had been the body of a child, and so bore it to acouch near and laid it down, kneeling beside it.Anne and Osmonde were beside her.  Osmonde pale himself, but gently calmand strong.  He had despatched for a physician the instant he saw thefall.""My lady,"" he said, bending over her, ""permit me to approach.  I havesome knowledge of these seizures.  Your pardon!""He knelt also and took the moveless hand, feeling the pulse; he, too,thrust his hand within the breast and held it there, looking at thesunken face.""My dear lord,"" her ladyship was saying, as if to the prostrate man\'s earalone, knowing that her tender voice must reach him if aught would--asindeed was truth.  ""Edward!  My dear--dear lord!""Osmonde held his hand steadily over the heart.  The guests shrunk back,stricken with terror.There was that in this corner of the splendid room which turned facespale.Osmonde slowly withdrew his hand, and turning to the kneeling woman--witha pallor like that of marble, but with a noble tenderness and pity in hiseyes--""My lady,"" he said, ""you are a brave woman.  Your great courage mustsustain you.  The heart beats no more.  A noble life is finished.""* * * * *The guests heard, and drew still farther back, a woman or two faintlywhimpering; a hurrying lacquey parted the crowd, and so, way being madefor him, the physician came quickly forward.Anne put her shaking hands up to cover her gaze.  Osmonde stood still,looking down.  My Lady Dunstanwolde knelt by the couch and hid herbeautiful face upon the dead man\'s breast.']"
78,13,Chapter 13,"['XII--Which treats of the obsequies of my Lord of Dunstanwolde, ofhis lady\'s widowhood, and of her return to townAll that remained of my Lord Dunstanwolde was borne back to his ancestralhome, and there laid to rest in the ancient tomb in which his fathersslept.  Many came from town to pay him respect, and the Duke of Osmondewas, as was but fitting, among them.  The countess kept her ownapartments, and none but her sister, Mistress Anne, beheld her.The night before the final ceremonies she spent sitting by her lord\'scoffin, and to Anne it seemed that her mood was a stranger one, than everwoman had before been ruled by.  She did not weep or moan, and only oncekneeled down.  In her sweeping black robes she seemed more a majesticcreature than she had ever been, and her beauty more that of a statuethan of a mortal woman.  She sent away all other watchers, keeping onlyher sister with her, and Anne observed in her a strange protectinggentleness when she spoke of the dead man.""I do not know whether dead men can feel and hear,"" she said.  ""Sometimesthere has come into my mind--and made me shudder--the thought that,though they lie so still, mayhap they know what we do--and how they arespoken of as nothings whom live men and women but wait a moment to thrustaway, that their own living may go on again in its accustomed way, orperchance more merrily.  If my lord knows aught, he will be grateful thatI watch by him to-night in this solemn room.  He was ever grateful, andmoved by any tenderness of mine.""\'Twas as she said, the room was solemn, and this almost to awfulness.  Itwas a huge cold chamber at best, and draped with black, and hung withhatchments; a silent gloom filled it which made it like a tomb.  Tall wax-candles burned in it dimly, but adding to its solemn shadows with theirfaint light; and in his rich coffin the dead man lay in his shroud, hishands like carvings of yellowed ivory clasped upon his breast.Mistress Anne dared not have entered the place alone, and was so overcomeat sight of the pinched nostrils and sunk eyes that she turned cold withfear.  But Clorinda seemed to feel no dread or shrinking.  She went andstood beside the great funeral-draped bed of state on which the coffinlay, and thus standing, looked down with a grave, protecting pity in herface.  Then she stooped and kissed the dead man long upon the brow.""I will sit by you to-night,"" she said.  ""That which lies here will bealone to-morrow.  I will not leave you this last night.  Had I been inyour place you would not leave me.""She sat down beside him and laid her strong warm hand upon his cold waxenones, closing it over them as if she would give them heat.  Anne kneltand prayed--that all might be forgiven, that sins might be blotted out,that this kind poor soul might find love and peace in the kingdom ofHeaven, and might not learn there what might make bitter the memory ofhis last year of rapture and love.  She was so simple that she forgotthat no knowledge of the past could embitter aught when a soul lookedback from Paradise.Throughout the watches of the night her sister sat and held the deadman\'s hand; she saw her more than once smooth his grey hair almost as amother might have touched a sick sleeping child\'s; again she kissed hisforehead, speaking to him gently, as if to tell him he need not fear, forshe was close at hand; just once she knelt, and Anne wondered if sheprayed, and in what manner, knowing that prayer was not her habit.\'Twas just before dawn she knelt so, and when she rose and stood besidehim, looking down again, she drew from the folds of her robe a littlepackage.""Anne,"" she said, as she untied the ribband that bound it, ""when first Iwas his wife I found him one day at his desk looking at these things asthey lay upon his hand.  He thought at first it would offend me to findhim so; but I told him that I was gentler than he thought--though not sogentle as the poor innocent girl who died in giving him his child.  \'Twasher picture he was gazing at, and a little ring and two locks of hair--onea brown ringlet from her head, and one--such a tiny wisp of down--fromthe head of her infant.  I told him to keep them always and look at themoften, remembering how innocent she had been, and that she had died forhim.  There were tears on my hand when he kissed it in thanking me.  Hekept the little package in his desk, and I have brought it to him.""The miniature was of a sweet-faced girl with large loving childish eyes,and cheeks that blushed like the early morning.  Clorinda looked at heralmost with tenderness.""There is no marrying or giving in marriage, \'tis said,"" quoth she; ""butwere there, \'tis you who were his wife--not I.  I was but a lighterthing, though I bore his name and he honoured me.  When you and yourchild greet him he will forget me--and all will be well.""She held the miniature and the soft hair to his cold lips a moment, andAnne saw with wonder that her own mouth worked.  She slipped the ring onhis least finger, and hid the picture and the ringlets within the palmsof his folded hands.""He was a good man,"" she said; ""he was the first good man that I had everknown.""  And she held out her hand to Anne and drew her from the roomwith her, and two crystal tears fell upon the bosom of her black robe andslipped away like jewels.When the funeral obsequies were over, the next of kin who was heir cameto take possession of the estate which had fallen to him, and the widowretired to her father\'s house for seclusion from the world.  The townhouse had been left to her by her deceased lord, but she did not wish toreturn to it until the period of her mourning was over and she laid asideher weeds.  The income the earl had been able to bestow upon her made hera rich woman, and when she chose to appear again in the world it would bewith the power to mingle with it fittingly.During her stay at her father\'s house she did much to make it a moresuitable abode for her, ordering down from London furnishings and workmento set her own apartments and Anne\'s in order.  But she would not occupythe rooms she had lived in heretofore.  For some reason it seemed to beher whim to have begun to have an enmity for them.  The first day sheentered them with Anne she stopped upon the threshold.""I will not stay here,"" she said.  ""I never loved the rooms--and now Ihate them.  It seems to me it was another woman who lived in them--inanother world.  \'Tis so long ago that \'tis ghostly.  Make ready the oldred chambers for me,"" to her woman; ""I will live there.  They have beenlong closed, and are worm-eaten and mouldy perchance; but a great firewill warm them.  And I will have furnishings from London to make them fitfor habitation.""The next day it seemed for a brief space as if she would have changedeven from the red chambers.""I did not know,"" she said, turning with a sudden movement from a sidewindow, ""that one might see the old rose garden from here.  I would nothave taken the room had I guessed it.  It is too dreary a wilderness,with its tangle of briars and its broken sun-dial.""""You cannot see the dial from here,"" said Anne, coming towards her with astrange paleness and haste.  ""One cannot see _within_ the garden from anywindow, surely.""""Nay,"" said Clorinda; ""\'tis not near enough, and the hedges are too high;but one knows \'tis there, and \'tis tiresome.""""Let us draw the curtains and not look, and forget it,"" said poor Anne.And she drew the draperies with a trembling hand; and ever after whilethey dwelt in the room they stayed so.My lady wore her mourning for more than a year, and in her sombretrailing weeds was a wonder to behold.  She lived in her father\'s house,and saw no company, but sat or walked and drove with her sister Anne, andvisited the poor.  The perfect stateliness of her decorum was more talkedabout than any levity would have been; those who were wont to gossipexpecting that having made her fine match and been so soon rid of herlord, she would begin to show her strange wild breeding again, andindulge in fantastical whims.  That she should wear her mourning withunflinching dignity and withdraw from the world as strictly as if she hadbeen a lady of royal blood mourning her prince, was the unexpected thing,and so was talked of everywhere.At the end of the eighteenth month she sent one day for Anne, who, comingat her bidding, found her standing in her chamber surrounded by blackrobes and draperies piled upon the bed, and chairs, and floor, theirsombreness darkening the room like a cloud; but she stood in their midstin a trailing garment of pure white, and in her bosom was a bright redrose tied with a knot of scarlet ribband, whose ends fell floating.  Herwoman was upon her knees before a coffer in which she was laying theweeds as she folded them.Mistress Anne paused within the doorway, her eyes dazzled by the tallradiant shape and blot of scarlet colour as if by the shining of the sun.She knew in that moment that all was changed, and that the world ofdarkness they had been living in for the past months was swept fromexistence.  When her sister had worn her mourning weeds she had seemedsomehow almost pale; but now she stood in the sunlight with the richscarlet on her cheek and lip, and the stars in her great eyes.""Come in, sister Anne,"" she said.  ""I lay aside my weeds, and my woman isfolding them away for me.  Dost know of any poor creature newly left awidow whom some of them would be a help to?  \'Tis a pity that so muchsombreness should lie in chests when there are perhaps poor souls to whomit would be a godsend.""Before the day was over, there was not a shred of black stuff left insight; such as had not been sent out of the house to be distributed,being packed away in coffers in the garrets under the leads.""You will wear it no more, sister?"" Anne asked once.  ""You will wear gaycolours--as if it had never been?""""It _is_ as if it had never been,"" Clorinda answered.  ""Ere now her lordis happy with her, and he is so happy that I am forgot.  I had a fancythat--perhaps at first--well, if he had looked down on earth--remembering--he would have seen I was faithful in my honouring of him.But now, I am sure--""She stopped with a half laugh.  ""\'Twas but a fancy,"" she said.  ""Perchancehe has known naught since that night he fell at my feet--and even so,poor gentleman, he hath a happy fate.  Yes, I will wear gay colours,""flinging up her arms as if she dropped fetters, and stretched herbeauteous limbs for ease--""gay colours--and roses and rich jewels--andall things--_all_ that will make me beautiful!""The next day there came a chest from London, packed close with splendidraiment; when she drove out again in her chariot her servants\'sad-coloured liveries had been laid by, and she was attired in rich hues,amidst which she glowed like some flower new bloomed.Her house in town was thrown open again, and set in order for her coming.She made her journey back in state, Mistress Anne accompanying her in hertravelling-coach.  As she passed over the highroad with her equipage andher retinue, or spent the night for rest at the best inns in the townsand villages, all seemed to know her name and state.""\'Tis the young widow of the Earl of Dunstanwolde,"" people said to eachother--""she that is the great beauty, and of such a wit and spirit thatshe is scarce like a mere young lady.  \'Twas said she wed him for hisrank; but afterwards \'twas known she made him a happy gentleman, thoughshe gave him no heir.  She wore weeds for him beyond the accustomed time,and is but now issuing from her retirement.""Mistress Anne felt as if she were attending some royal lady\'s progress,people so gazed at them and nudged each other, wondered and admired.""You do not mind that all eyes rest on you,"" she said to her sister; ""youare accustomed to be gazed at.""""I have been gazed at all my life,"" my lady answered; ""I scarce take noteof it.""On their arrival at home they met with fitting welcome and reverence.  Thedoors of the town house were thrown open wide, and in the hall theservants stood in line, the housekeeper at the head with her keys at hergirdle, the little jet-black negro page grinning beneath his turban withjoy to see his lady again, he worshipping her as a sort of fetich, afterthe manner of his race.  \'Twas his duty to take heed to the pet dogs, andhe stood holding by their little silver chains a smart-faced pug and apretty spaniel.  His lady stopped a moment to pat them and to speak tohim a word of praise of their condition; and being so favoured, he spokealso, rolling his eyes in his delight at finding somewhat to impart.""Yesterday, ladyship, when I took them out,"" he said, ""a gentleman markedthem, knowing whose they were.  He asked me when my lady came again totown, and I answered him to-day.  \'Twas the fair gentleman in his ownhair.""""\'Twas Sir John Oxon, your ladyship,"" said the lacquey nearest to him.Her ladyship left caressing her spaniel and stood upright.  Little Nerowas frightened, fearing she was angered; she stood so straight and tall,but she said nothing and passed on.At the top of the staircase she turned to Mistress Anne with a laugh.""Thy favourite again, Anne,"" she said.  ""He means to haunt me, now we arealone.  \'Tis thee he comes after.""']"
78,14,Chapter 14,"['XIII--Wherein a deadly war beginsThe town and the World of Fashion greeted her on her return with openarms.  Those who looked on when she bent the knee to kiss the hand ofRoyalty at the next drawing-room, whispered among themselves thatbereavement had not dimmed her charms, which were even more radiant thanthey had been at her presentation on her marriage, and that the mind ofno man or woman could dwell on aught as mournful as widowhood inconnection with her, or, indeed, could think of anything but herbrilliant beauty.  \'Twas as if from this time she was launched into a newlife.  Being rich, of high rank, and no longer an unmarried woman, herposition had a dignity and freedom which there was no creature but mighthave envied.  As the wife of Dunstanwolde she had been the fashion, andadored by all who dared adore her; but as his widow she was surroundedand besieged.  A fortune, a toast, a wit, and a beauty, she combined allthe things either man or woman could desire to attach themselves to thetrain of; and had her air been less regal, and her wit less keen of edge,she would have been so beset by flatterers and toadies that life wouldhave been burdensome.  But this she would not have, and was swift enoughto detect the man whose debts drove him to the expedient of daring toprivately think of the usefulness of her fortune, or the woman whomanoeuvred to gain reputation or success by means of her position andpower.""They would be about me like vultures if I were weak fool enough to letthem,"" she said to Anne.  ""They cringe and grovel like spaniels, andflatter till \'tis like to make one sick.  \'Tis always so with toadies;they have not the wit to see that their flattery is an insolence, sinceit supposes adulation so rare that one may be moved by it.  The men withempty pockets would marry me, forsooth, and the women be dragged intocompany clinging to my petticoats.  But they are learning.  I do notshrink from giving them sharp lessons.""This she did without mercy, and in time cleared herself of hangers-on, sothat her banquets and assemblies were the most distinguished of the time,and the men who paid their court to her were of such place and fortunethat their worship could but be disinterested.Among the earliest to wait upon her was his Grace of Osmonde, who foundher one day alone, save for the presence of Mistress Anne, whom she keptoften with her.  When the lacquey announced him, Anne, who sat upon thesame seat with her, felt her slightly start, and looking up, saw in hercountenance a thing she had never beheld before, nor had indeed everdreamed of beholding.  It was a strange, sweet crimson which flowed overher face, and seemed to give a wondrous deepness to her lovely orbs.  Sherose as a queen might have risen had a king come to her, but never hadthere been such pulsing softness in her look before.  \'Twas in somecurious fashion like the look of a girl; and, in sooth, she was but agirl in years, but so different to all others of her age, and had livedso singular a life, that no one ever thought of her but as a woman, orwould have deemed it aught but folly to credit her with any tenderemotion or blushing warmth girlhood might be allowed.His Grace was as courtly of bearing as he had ever been.  He stayed notlong, and during his visit conversed but on such subjects as a kinsmanmay graciously touch upon; but Anne noted in him a new look also, thoughshe could scarce have told what it might be.  She thought that he lookedhappier, and her fancy was that some burden had fallen from him.Before he went away he bent low and long over Clorinda\'s hand, pressinghis lips to it with a tenderness which strove not to conceal itself.  Andthe hand was not withdrawn, her ladyship standing in sweet yielding, thetender crimson trembling on her cheek.  Anne herself trembled, watchingher new, strange loveliness with a sense of fascination; she could scarcewithdraw her eyes, it seemed so as if the woman had been reborn.""Your Grace will come to us again,"" my lady said, in a soft voice.  ""Weare two lonely women,"" with her radiant compelling smile, ""and need yourkindly countenancing.""His eyes dwelt deep in hers as he answered, and there was a flush uponhis own cheek, man and warrior though he was.""If I might come as often as I would,"" he said, ""I should be at yourdoor, perhaps, with too great frequency.""""Nay, your Grace,"" she answered.  ""Come as often as _we_ would--and seewho wearies first.  \'Twill not be ourselves.""He kissed her hand again, and this time \'twas passionately, and when heleft her presence it was with a look of radiance on his noble face, andwith the bearing of a king new crowned.For a few moments\' space she stood where he had parted from her, lookingas though listening to the sound of his step, as if she would not lose afootfall; then she went to the window, and stood among the flowers there,looking down into the street, and Anne saw that she watched his equipage.\'Twas early summer, and the sunshine flooded her from head to foot; thewindow and balcony were full of flowers--yellow jonquils and daffodils,white narcissus, and all things fragrant of the spring.  The scent ofthem floated about her like an incense, and a straying zephyr blew greatpuffs of their sweetness back into the room.  Anne felt it all about her,and remembered it until she was an aged woman.Clorinda\'s bosom rose high in an exultant, rapturous sigh.""\'Tis the Spring that comes,"" she murmured breathlessly.  ""Never hath itcome to me before.""Even as she said the words, at the very moment of her speaking, Fate--astrange Fate indeed--brought to her yet another visitor.  The door wasthrown open wide, and in he came, a lacquey crying aloud his name.  \'TwasSir John Oxon.* * * * *Those of the World of Fashion who were wont to gossip, had bestowed uponthem a fruitful subject for discussion over their tea-tables, in thefuture of the widowed Lady Dunstanwolde.  All the men being enamoured ofher, \'twas not likely that she would long remain unmarried, her period ofmourning being over; and, accordingly, forthwith there was every daychosen for her a new husband by those who concerned themselves in heraffairs, and they were many.  One week \'twas a great general she was saidto smile on; again, a great beau and female conqueror, it being arguedthat, having made her first marriage for rank and wealth, and being apassionate and fantastic beauty, she would this time allow herself to beruled by her caprice, and wed for love; again, a certain marquis wasnamed, and after him a young earl renowned for both beauty and wealth;but though each and all of those selected were known to have laidthemselves at her feet, none of them seemed to have met with the favourthey besought for.There were two men, however, who were more spoken of than all the rest,and whose court awakened a more lively interest; indeed, \'twas aninterest which was lively enough at times to become almost a matter ofcontention, for those who upheld the cause of the one man would not hearof the success of the other, the claims of each being considered of suchdifferent nature.  These two men were the Duke of Osmonde and Sir JohnOxon.  \'Twas the soberer and more dignified who were sure his Grace hadbut to proffer his suit to gain it, and their sole wonder lay in that hedid not speak more quickly.""But being a man of such noble mind, it may be that he would leave her toher freedom yet a few months, because, despite her stateliness, she isbut young, and \'twould be like his honourableness to wish that she shouldsee many men while she is free to choose, as she has never been before.For these days she is not a poor beauty as she was when she tookDunstanwolde.""The less serious, or less worldly, especially the sentimental spinstersand matrons and romantic young, who had heard and enjoyed the rumours ofMistress Clorinda Wildairs\' strange early days, were prone to build muchupon a certain story of that time.""Sir John Oxon was her first love,"" they said.  ""He went to her father\'shouse a beautiful young man in his earliest bloom, and she had neverencountered such an one before, having only known country dolts and herfather\'s friends.  \'Twas said they loved each other, but were bothpassionate and proud, and quarrelled bitterly.  Sir John went to Franceto strive to forget her in gay living; he even obeyed his mother and paidcourt to another woman, and Mistress Clorinda, being of fiercehaughtiness, revenged herself by marrying Lord Dunstanwolde.""""But she has never deigned to forgive him,"" \'twas also said.  ""She is toohaughty and of too high a temper to forgive easily that a man should seemto desert her for another woman\'s favour.  Even when \'twas whispered thatshe favoured him, she was disdainful, and sometimes flouted him bitterly,as was her way with all men.  She was never gentle, and had always acutting wit.  She will use him hardly before she relents; but if he suespatiently enough with such grace as he uses with other women, love willconquer her at last, for \'twas her first.""She showed him no great favour, it was true; and yet it seemed shegranted him more privilege than she had done during her lord\'s life, forhe was persistent in his following her, and would come to her housewhether of her will or of his own.  Sometimes he came there when the Dukeof Osmonde was with her--this happened more than once--and then herladyship\'s face, which was ever warmly beautiful when Osmonde was near,would curiously change.  It would grow pale and cold; but in her eyeswould burn a strange light which one man knew was as the light in theeyes of a tigress lying chained, but crouching to leap.  But it was notOsmonde who felt this, he saw only that she changed colour, and havingheard the story of her girlhood, a little chill of doubt would fall uponhis noble heart.  It was not doubt of her, but of himself, and fear thathis great passion made him blind; for he was the one man chivalrousenough to remember how young she was, and to see the cruelty of the Fatewhich had given her unmothered childhood into the hands of a coarserioter and debauchee, making her his plaything and his whim.  And if inher first hours of bloom she had been thrown with youthful manhood andbeauty, what more in the course of nature than that she should havelearned to love; and being separated from her young lover by their mutualyouthful faults of pride and passionateness of temper, what more naturalthan, being free again, and he suing with all his soul, that her heartshould return to him, even though through a struggle with pride.  In herlord\'s lifetime he had not seen Oxon near her; and in those days when hehad so struggled with his own surging love, and striven to bear himselfnobly, he had kept away from her, knowing that his passion was too greatand strong for any man to always hold at bay and make no sign, because atbrief instants he trembled before the thought that in her eyes he hadseen that which would have sprung to answer the same self in him if shehad been a free woman.  But now when, despite her coldness, which nevermelted to John Oxon, she still turned pale and seemed to fall under arestraint on his coming, a man of sufficient high dignity to besplendidly modest where his own merit was concerned, might well feel thatfor this there must be a reason, and it might be a grave one.So though he would not give up his suit until he was sure that \'twaseither useless or unfair, he did not press it as he would have done, butsaw his lady when he could, and watched with all the tenderness ofpassion her lovely face and eyes.  But one short town season passedbefore he won his prize; but to poor Anne it seemed that in its passingshe lived years.Poor woman, as she had grown thin and large-eyed in those days gone by,she grew so again.  Time in passing had taught her so much that othersdid not know; and as she served her sister, and waited on her wishes, shesaw that of which no other dreamed, and saw without daring to speak, orshow by any sign, her knowledge.The day when Lady Dunstanwolde had turned from standing among herdaffodils, and had found herself confronting the open door of her saloon,and John Oxon passing through it, Mistress Anne had seen that in her faceand his which had given to her a shock of terror.  In John Oxon\'s blueeyes there had been a set fierce look, and in Clorinda\'s a blaze whichhad been like a declaration of war; and these same looks she had seensince that day, again and again.  Gradually it had become her sister\'shabit to take Anne with her into the world as she had not done before herwidowhood, and Anne knew whence this custom came.  There were times when,by use of her presence, she could avoid those she wished to thrust aside,and Anne noted, with a cold sinking of the spirit, that the one she wouldplan to elude most frequently was Sir John Oxon; and this was not doneeasily.  The young man\'s gay lightness of demeanour had changed.  The fewyears that had passed since he had come to pay his courts to the youngbeauty in male attire, had brought experiences to him which had beenbitter enough.  He had squandered his fortune, and failed to reinstatehimself by marriage; his dissipations had told upon him, and he had losthis spirit and good-humour; his mocking wit had gained a bitterness; hisgallantry had no longer the gaiety of youth.  And the woman he had lovedfor an hour with youthful passion, and had dared to dream of castingaside in boyish insolence, had risen like a phoenix, and soared high andtriumphant to the very sun itself.  ""He was ever base,"" Clorinda hadsaid.  ""As he was at first he is now,"" and in the saying there was truth.If she had been helpless and heartbroken, and had pined for him, he wouldhave treated her as a victim, and disdained her humiliation and grief;magnificent, powerful, rich, in fullest beauty, and disdaining himself,she filled him with a mad passion of love which was strangely mixed withhatred and cruelty.  To see her surrounded by her worshippers, courted bythe Court itself, all eyes drawn towards her as she moved, all heartslaid at her feet, was torture to him.  In such cases as his and hers, itwas the woman who should sue for love\'s return, and watch the avertedface, longing for the moment when it would deign to turn and she couldcatch the cold eye and plead piteously with her own.  This he had seen;this, men like himself, but older, had taught him with vicious art; buthere was a woman who had scorned him at the hour which should have beenthe moment of his greatest powerfulness, who had mocked at and lashed himin the face with the high derision of a creature above law, and who neverfor one instant had bent her neck to the yoke which women must bear.  Shehad laughed it to scorn--and him--and all things--and gone on her way,crowned with her scarlet roses, to wealth, and rank, and power, andadulation; while he--the man, whose right it was to be transgressor--hadfallen upon hard fortune, and was losing step by step all she had won.  Inhis way he loved her madly--as he had loved her before, and as he wouldhave loved any woman who embodied triumph and beauty; and burning withdesire for both, and with jealous rage of all, he swore he would not beoutdone, befooled, cast aside, and trampled on.At the playhouse when she looked from her box, she saw him leaningagainst some pillar or stationed in some noticeable spot, his bold blueeyes fixed burningly upon her; at fashionable assemblies he made his wayto her side and stood near her, gazing, or dropping words into her ear;at church he placed himself in some pew near by, that she and all theworld might behold him; when she left her coach and walked in the Mall hejoined her or walked behind.  At such times in my lady\'s close-fringedeyes there shone a steady gleam; but they were ever eyes that glowed, andthere were none who had ever come close enough to her to know her well,and so there were none who read its meaning.  Only Anne knew as no othercreature could, and looked on with secret terror and dismay.  The worldbut said that he was a man mad with love, and desperate at the knowledgeof the powerfulness of his rivals, could not live beyond sight of her.They did not hear the words that passed between them at times when hestood near her in some crowd, and dropped, as \'twas thought, words ofburning prayer and love into her ear.  \'Twas said that it was like her tolisten with unchanging face, and when she deigned reply, to answerwithout turning towards him.  But such words and replies it had more thanonce been Anne\'s ill-fortune to be near enough to catch, and hearing themshe had shuddered.One night at a grand rout, the Duke of Osmonde but just having left thereigning beauty\'s side, she heard the voice she hated close by her,speaking.""You think you can disdain me to the end,"" it said.  ""Your ladyship is_sure_ so?""She did not turn or answer, and there followed a low laugh.""You think a man will lie beneath your feet and be trodden upon withoutspeaking.  You are too high and bold.""She waved her painted fan, and gazed steadily before her at the crowd,now and then bending her head in gracious greeting and smiling at somepasser-by.""If I could tell the story of the rose garden, and of what the sun-dialsaw, and what the moon shone on--"" he said.He heard her draw her breath sharply through her teeth, he saw her whitebosom lift as if a wild beast leapt within it, and he laughed again.""His Grace of Osmonde returns,"" he said; and then marking, as he neverfailed to do, bitterly against his will, the grace and majesty of thisrival, who was one of the greatest and bravest of England\'s gentlemen,and knowing that she marked it too, his rage so mounted that it overcamehim.""Sometimes,"" he said, ""methinks that I shall _kill_ you!""""Would you gain your end thereby?"" she answered, in a voice as low anddeadly.""I would frustrate his--and yours.""""Do it, then,"" she hissed back, ""some day when you think I fear you.""""\'Twould be too easy,"" he answered.  ""You fear it too little.  There arebitterer things.""She rose and met his Grace, who had approached her.  Always to hisgreatness and his noble heart she turned with that new feeling ofdependence which her whole life had never brought to her before.  Hisdeep eyes, falling on her tenderly as she rose, were filled withprotecting concern.  Involuntarily he hastened his steps.""Will your Grace take me to my coach?"" she said.  ""I am not well.  MayI--go?"" as gently as a tender, appealing girl.And moved by this, as by her pallor, more than his man\'s words could havetold, he gave her his arm and drew her quickly and supportingly away.Mistress Anne did not sleep well that night, having much to distract hermind and keep her awake, as was often in these days the case.  When atlength she closed her eyes her slumber was fitful and broken by dreams,and in the mid hour of the darkness she wakened with a start as if somesound had aroused her.  Perhaps there had been some sound, though all wasstill when she opened her eyes; but in the chair by her bedside satClorinda in her night-rail, her hands wrung hard together on her knee,her black eyes staring under a brow knit into straight deep lines.""Sister!"" cried Anne, starting up in bed.  ""Sister!""Clorinda slowly turned her head towards her, whereupon Anne saw that inher face there was a look as if of horror which struggled with a grief, awoe, too monstrous to be borne.""Lie down, Anne,"" she said.  ""Be not afraid--\'tis only I,"" bitterly--""whoneed fear?""Anne cowered among the pillows and hid her face in her thin hands.  Sheknew so well that this was true.""I never thought the time would come,"" her sister said, ""when I shouldseek you for protection.  A thing has come upon me--perhaps I shall gomad--to-night, alone in my room, I wanted to sit near a woman--\'twas notlike me, was it?""Mistress Anne crept near the bed\'s edge, and stretching forth a hand,touched hers, which were as cold as marble.""Stay with me, sister,"" she prayed.  ""Sister, do not go!  What--what canI say?""""Naught,"" was the steady answer.  ""There is naught to be said.  You werealways a woman--I was never one--till now.""She rose up from her chair and threw up her arms, pacing to and fro.""I am a desperate creature,"" she cried.  ""Why was I born?""She walked the room almost like a thing mad and caged.""Why was I thrown into the world?"" striking her breast.  ""Why was I madeso--and not one to watch or care through those mad years?  To be given abody like this--and tossed to the wolves.""She turned to Anne, her arms outstretched, and so stood white and strangeand beauteous as a statue, with drops like great pearls running down herlovely cheeks, and she caught her breath sobbingly, like a child.""I was thrown to them,"" she wailed piteously, ""and they harried me--andleft the marks of their great teeth--and of the scars I cannot ridmyself--and since it was my fate--pronounced from my first hour--why wasnot this,"" clutching her breast, ""left hard as \'twas at first?  Not awoman\'s--not a woman\'s, but a she-cub\'s.  Ah! \'twas not just--not justthat it should be so!""Anne slipped from her bed and ran to her, falling upon her knees andclinging to her, weeping bitterly.""Poor heart!"" she cried.  ""Poor, dearest heart!""Her touch and words seemed to recall Clorinda to herself.  She started asif wakened from a dream, and drew her form up rigid.""I have gone mad,"" she said.  ""What is it I do?""  She passed her handacross her brow and laughed a little wild laugh.  ""Yes,"" she said; ""thisit is to be a woman--to turn weak and run to other women--and weep andtalk.  Yes, by these signs I _am_ a woman!""  She stood with her clenchedhands pressed against her breast.  ""In any fair fight,"" she said, ""Icould have struck back blow for blow--and mine would have been theheaviest; but being changed into a woman, my arms are taken from me.  Hewho strikes, aims at my bared breast--and that he knows and triumphs in.""She set her teeth together, and ground them, and the look, which was likethat of a chained and harried tigress, lit itself in her eyes.""But there is _none_ shall beat me,"" she said through these fierce shutteeth.  ""Nay I there is _none_!  Get up, Anne,"" bending to raise her.""Get up, or I shall be kneeling too--and I must stand upon my feet.""She made a motion as if she would have turned and gone from the roomwithout further explanation, but Anne still clung to her.  She was afraidof her again, but her piteous love was stronger than her fear.""Let me go with you,"" she cried.  ""Let me but go and lie in your closetthat I may be near, if you should call.""Clorinda put her hands upon her shoulders, and stooping, kissed her,which in all their lives she had done but once or twice.""God bless thee, poor Anne,"" she said.  ""I think thou wouldst lie on mythreshold and watch the whole night through, if I should need it; but Ihave given way to womanish vapours too much--I must go and be alone.  Iwas driven by my thoughts to come and sit and look at thy good face--Idid not mean to wake thee.  Go back to bed.""She would be obeyed, and led Anne to her couch herself, making her liedown, and drawing the coverlet about her; after which she stood uprightwith a strange smile, laying her hands lightly about her own whitethroat.""When I was a new-born thing and had a little throat and a weak breath,""she cried, ""\'twould have been an easy thing to end me.  I have been toldI lay beneath my mother when they found her dead.  If, when she felt herbreath leaving her, she had laid her hand upon my mouth and stopped mine,I should not,"" with the little laugh again--""I should not lie awake to-night.""And then she went away.']"
78,15,Chapter 15,"['XIV--Containing the history of the breaking of the horse Devil,and relates the returning of his Grace of Osmonde from FranceThere were in this strange nature, depths so awful and profound that itwas not to be sounded or to be judged as others were.  But one thingcould have melted or caused the unconquerable spirit to bend, and thiswas the overwhelming passion of love--not a slight, tender feeling, but agreat and powerful one, such as could be awakened but by a being of asstrong and deep a nature as itself, one who was in all things its peer.""I have been lonely--lonely all my life,"" my Lady Dunstanwolde had oncesaid to her sister, and she had indeed spoken a truth.Even in her childhood she had felt in some strange way she stood apartfrom the world about her.  Before she had been old enough to reason shehad been conscious that she was stronger and had greater power andendurance than any human being about her.  Her strength she used in thesedays in wilful tyranny, and indeed it was so used for many a day when shewas older.  The time had never been when an eye lighted on her withindifference, or when she could not rule and punish as she willed.  As aninfant she had browbeaten the women-servants and the stable-boys andgrooms; but because of her quick wit and clever tongue, and also becauseno humour ever made her aught but a creature well worth looking at, theyhad taken her bullying in good-humour and loved her in their coarse way.She had tyrannised over her father and his companions, and they hadadored and boasted of her; but there had not been one among them whom shecould have turned to if a softer moment had come upon her and she hadfelt the need of a friend, nor indeed one whom she did not regardprivately with contempt.A god or goddess forced upon earth and surrounded by mere human beingswould surely feel a desolateness beyond the power of common words toexpress, and a human being endowed with powers and physical gifts so rareas to be out of all keeping with those of its fellows of ordinary buildand mental stature must needs be lonely too.She had had no companion, because she had found none like herself, andnone with whom she could have aught in common.  Anne she had pitied,being struck by some sense of the unfairness of her lot as compared withher own.  John Oxon had moved her, bringing to her her first knowledge ofbuoyant, ardent youth, and blooming strength and beauty; for Dunstanwoldeshe had felt gratitude and affection; but than these there had been noothers who even distantly had touched her heart.The night she had given her promise to Dunstanwolde, and had made herobeisance before his kinsman as she had met his deep and leonine eye, shehad known that \'twas the only man\'s eye before which her own would falland which held the power to rule her very soul.She did not think this as a romantic girl would have thought it; it wasrevealed to her by a sudden tempestuous leap of her heart, and by a shocklike terror.  Here was the man who was of her own build, whose thews andsinews of mind and body was as powerful as her own--here was he who, hadshe met him one short year before, would have revolutionised her world.In the days of her wifehood when she had read in his noble face somethingof that which he endeavoured to command and which to no other wasapparent, the dignity of his self-restraint had but filled her withtenderness more passionate and grateful.""Had he been a villain and a coward,"" was her thought, ""he would havemade my life a bitter battle; but \'tis me he loves, not himself only, andas I honour him so does he honour me.""Now she beheld the same passion in his eyes, but no more held in leash:his look met hers, hiding from her nothing of what his high soul burnedwith; and she was free--free to answer when he spoke, and only feelingone bitterness in her heart--if he had but come in time--God! why had henot been sent in time?But, late or early, he had come; and what they had to give each othershould not be mocked at and lost.  The night she had ended by going toAnne\'s chamber, she had paced her room saying this again and again, allthe strength of her being rising in revolt.  She had been then a cagedtigress of a verity; she had wrung her hands; she had held her palm hardagainst her leaping heart; she had walked madly to and fro, battling inthought with what seemed awful fate; she had flung herself upon her kneesand wept bitter scalding tears.""He is so noble,"" she had cried--""he is so noble--and I so worship hisnobleness--and I have been so base!""And in her suffering her woman\'s nerves had for a moment betrayed her.Heretofore she had known no weakness of her sex, but the woman soul inher so being moved, she had been broken and conquered for a space, andhad gone to Anne\'s chamber, scarcely knowing what refuge she so sought.It had been a feminine act, and she had realised all it signified whenAnne sank weeping by her.  Women who wept and prated together at midnightin their chambers ended by telling their secrets.  So it was that it fellout that Anne saw not again the changed face to the sight of which shehad that night awakened.  It seemed as if my lady from that time madeplans which should never for a moment leave her alone.  The next day shewas busied arranging a brilliant rout, the next a rich banquet, the nexta great assembly; she drove in the Mall in her stateliest equipages; shewalked upon its promenade, surrounded by her crowd of courtiers, smilingupon them, and answering them with shafts of graceful wit--the charm ofher gaiety had never been so remarked upon, her air never so enchanting.At every notable gathering in the World of Fashion she was to be seen.Being bidden to the Court, which was at Hampton, her brilliant beauty andspirit so enlivened the royal dulness that \'twas said the Queen herselfwas scarce resigned to part with her, and that the ladies and gentlemenin waiting all suffered from the spleen when she withdrew.  She bought atthis time the fiercest but most beautiful beast of a horse she had evermounted.  The creature was superbly handsome, but apparently sounconquerable and so savage that her grooms were afraid to approach it,and indeed it could not be saddled and bitted unless she herself stoodnear.  Even the horse-dealer, rogue though he was, had sold it to herwith some approach to a qualm of conscience, having confessed to her thatit had killed two grooms, and been sentenced to be shot by its firstowner, and was still living only because its great beauty had led him tohesitate for a few days.  It was by chance that during these few daysLady Dunstanwolde heard of it, and going to see it, desired and bought itat once.""It is the very beast I want,"" she said, with a gleam in her eye.  ""Itwill please me to teach it that there is one stronger than itself.""She had much use for her loaded riding-whip; and indeed, not finding itheavy enough, ordered one made which was heavier.  When she rode thebeast in Hyde Park, her first battles with him were the town talk; andthere were those who bribed her footmen to inform them beforehand, whenmy lady was to take out Devil, that they might know in time to be in thePark to see her.  Fops and hunting-men laid wagers as to whether herladyship would kill the horse or be killed by him, and followed hertraining of the creature with an excitement and delight quite wild.""Well may the beast\'s name be Devil,"" said more than one looker-on; ""forhe is not so much horse as demon.  And when he plunges and rears andshows his teeth, there is a look in his eye which flames like her own,and \'tis as if a male and female demon fought together, for surely such awoman never lived before.  She will not let him conquer her, God knows;and it would seem that he was swearing in horse fashion that she shouldnot conquer him.""When he was first bought and brought home, Mistress Anne turned ashy atthe sight of him, and in her heart of hearts grieved bitterly that it hadso fallen out that his Grace of Osmonde had been called away from town byhigh and important matters; for she knew full well, that if he had beenin the neighbourhood, he would have said some discreet and tender word ofwarning to which her ladyship would have listened, though she would havetreated with disdain the caution of any other man or woman.  When sheherself ventured to speak, Clorinda looked only stern.""I have ridden only ill-tempered beasts all my life, and that for themere pleasure of subduing them,"" she said.  ""I have no liking for a horselike a bell-wether; and if this one should break my neck, I need battlewith neither men nor horses again, and I shall die at the high tide oflife and power; and those who think of me afterwards will only rememberthat they loved me--that they loved me.""But the horse did not kill her, nor she it.  Day after day she stood bywhile it was taken from its stall, many a time dealing with it herself,because no groom dare approach; and then she would ride it forth, and inHyde Park force it to obey her; the wondrous strength of her will, herwrist of steel, and the fierce, pitiless punishment she inflicted,actually daunting the devilish creature\'s courage.  She would ride fromthe encounter, through two lines of people who had been watching her--andsome of them found themselves following after her, even to the Parkgate--almost awed as they looked at her, sitting erect and splendid onthe fretted, anguished beast, whose shining skin was covered with lather,whose mouth tossed blood-flecked foam, and whose great eye was sostrangely like her own, but that hers glowed with the light of triumph,and his burned with the agonised protest of the vanquished.  At suchtimes there was somewhat of fear in the glances that followed her beauty,which almost seemed to blaze--her colour was so rich, the curve of herred mouth so imperial, the poise of her head, with its loosening coils ofvelvet black hair, so high.""It is good for me that I do this,"" she said to Anne, with a short laugh,one day.  ""I was growing too soft--and I have need now for all my power.To fight with the demon in this beast, rouses all in me that I have heldin check since I became my poor lord\'s wife.  That the creature shouldhave set his will against all others, and should resist me with suchstrength and devilishness, rouses in me the passion of the days when Icursed and raved and struck at those who angered me.  \'Tis fury thatpossesses me, and I could curse and shriek at him as I flog him, if\'twould be seemly.  As it would not be so, I shut my teeth hard, andshriek and curse within them, and none can hear.""Among those who made it their custom to miss no day when she went forthon Devil that they might stand near and behold her, there was one manever present, and \'twas Sir John Oxon.  He would stand as near as mightbe and watch the battle, a stealthy fire in his eye, and a look as if theoutcome of the fray had deadly meaning to him.  He would gnaw his lipuntil at times the blood started; his face would by turns flush scarletand turn deadly pale; he would move suddenly and restlessly, and breakforth under breath into oaths of exclamation.  One day a man close by himsaw him suddenly lay his hand upon his sword, and having so done, stillkeep it there, though \'twas plain he quickly remembered where he was.As for the horse\'s rider, my Lady Dunstanwolde, whose way it had been toavoid this man and to thrust him from her path by whatsoever adroit meansshe could use, on these occasions made no effort to evade him and hisglances; in sooth, he knew, though none other did so, that when shefought with her horse she did it with a fierce joy in that he beheld her.\'Twas as though the battle was between themselves; and knowing this inthe depths of such soul as he possessed, there were times when the manwould have exulted to see the brute rise and fall upon her, crushing herout of life, or dash her to the earth and set his hoof upon her dazzlingupturned face.  Her scorn and deadly defiance of him, her beauty andmaddening charm, which seemed but to increase with every hour that flewby, had roused his love to fury.  Despite his youth, he was a villain, ashe had ever been; even in his first freshness there had been oldermen--and hardened ones--who had wondered at the selfish mercilessness andblackness of the heart that was but that of a boy.  They had said amongthemselves that at his years they had never known a creature who could beso gaily a dastard, one who could plan with such light remorselessness,and using all the gifts given him by Nature solely for his own ends,would take so much and give so little.  In truth, as time had gone on,men who had been his companions, and had indeed small consciences toboast of, had begun to draw off a little from him, and frequent hiscompany less.  He chose to tell himself that this was because he hadsquandered his fortune and was less good company, being pursued bycreditors and haunted by debts; but though there was somewhat in this,perchance \'twas not the entire truth.""By Gad!"" said one over his cups, ""there are things even a rake-hellfellow like me cannot do; but he does them, and seems not to know thatthey are to his discredit.""There had been a time when without this woman\'s beauty he might havelived--indeed, he had left it of his own free vicious will; but in thesedays, when his fortunes had changed and she represented all that he stoodmost desperately in need of, her beauty drove him mad.  In his hauntingof her, as he followed her from place to place, his passion grew day byday, and all the more gained strength and fierceness because it was somixed with hate.  He tossed upon his bed at night and cursed her; heremembered the wild past, and the memory all but drove him to delirium.He knew of what stern stuff she was made, and that even if her love haddied, she would have held to her compact like grim death, even whileloathing him.  And he had cast all this aside in one mad moment of boyishcupidity and folly; and now that she was so radiant and entrancing athing, and wealth, and splendour, and rank, and luxury lay in the hollowof her hand, she fixed her beauteous devil\'s eyes upon him with a scornin their black depths which seemed to burn like fires of hell.The great brute who dashed, and plunged, and pranced beneath her seemedto have sworn to conquer her as he had sworn himself; but let him plungeand kick as he would, there was no quailing in her eye, she sat like acreature who was superhuman, and her hand was iron, her wrist was steel.She held him so that he could not do his worst without such pain as woulddrive him mad; she lashed him, and rained on him such blows as almostmade him blind.  Once at the very worst, Devil dancing near him, shelooked down from his back into John Oxon\'s face, and he cursed aloud, hereye so told him his own story and hers.  In those days their souls met insuch combat as it seemed must end in murder itself.""You will not conquer him,"" he said to her one morning, forcing himselfnear enough to speak.""I will, unless he kills me,"" she answered, ""and that methinks he willfind it hard to do.""""He will kill you,"" he said.  ""I would, were I in his four shoes.""""You would if you could,"" were her words; ""but you could not with his bitin your mouth and my hand on the snaffle.  And if he killed me, still\'twould be he, not I, was beaten; since he could only kill what anybloody villain could with any knife.  He is a brute beast, and I am thatwhich was given dominion over such.  Look on till I have done with him.""And thus, with other beholders, though in a different mood from theirs,he did, until a day when even the most sceptical saw that the brute cameto the fray with less of courage, as if there had at last come into hisbrain the dawning of a fear of that which rid him, and all his madnesscould not displace from its throne upon his back.""By God!"" cried more than one of the bystanders, seeing this, despite theanimal\'s fury, ""the beast gives way!  He gives way!  She has him!""  AndJohn Oxon, shutting his teeth, cut short an oath and turned pale asdeath.From that moment her victory was a thing assured.  The duel of strengthbecame less desperate, and having once begun to learn his lesson, thebrute was made to learn it well.  His bearing was a thing superb tobehold; once taught obedience, there would scarce be a horse like him inthe whole of England.  And day by day this he learned from her, and beingmastered, was put through his paces, and led to answer to the rein, sothat he trotted, cantered, galloped, and leaped as a bird flies.  Then asthe town had come to see him fight for freedom, it came to see him adornthe victory of the being who had conquered him, and over their dishes oftea in the afternoon beaux and beauties of fashion gossiped of theinteresting and exciting event; and there were vapourish ladies who vowedthey could not have beaten a brute so, and that surely my LadyDunstanwolde must have looked hot and blowzy while she did it, and havehad the air of a great rough man; and there were some pretty tiffs andeven quarrels when the men swore that never had she looked so magnificenta beauty and so inflamed the hearts of all beholding her.On the first day after her ladyship\'s last battle with her horse, the onewhich ended in such victory to her that she rode him home hard throughthe streets without an outbreak, he white with lather, and marked withstripes, but his large eye holding in its velvet a look which seemedalmost like a human thought--on that day after there occurred a thingwhich gave the town new matter to talk of.His Grace of Osmonde had been in France, called there by business of theState, and during his absence the gossip concerning the horse Devil hadtaken the place of that which had before touched on himself.  \'Twas notannounced that he was to return to England, and indeed there were thosewho, speaking with authority, said that for two weeks at least hisaffairs abroad would not be brought to a close; and yet on this morning,as my Lady Dunstanwolde rode \'neath the trees, holding Devil well inhand, and watching him with eagle keenness of eye, many looking on inwait for the moment when the brute might break forth suddenly again, ahorseman was seen approaching at a pace so rapid that \'twas on the vergeof a gallop, and the first man who beheld him looked amazed and liftedhis hat, and the next, seeing him, spoke to another, who bowed with him,and all along the line of loungers hats were removed, and people wore theair of seeing a man unexpectedly, and hearing a name spoken inexclamation by his side, Sir John Oxon looked round and beheld ride by mylord Duke of Osmonde.  The sun was shining brilliantly, and all the Parkwas gay with bright warmth and greenness of turf and trees.  Clorindafelt the glow of the summer morning permeate her being.  She kept herwatch upon her beast; but he was going well, and in her soul she knewthat he was beaten, and that her victory had been beheld by the one manwho knew that it meant to her that which it seemed to mean also tohimself.  And filled with this thought and the joy of it, she rodebeneath the trees, and so was riding with splendid spirit when she hearda horse behind her, and looked up as it drew near, and the rich crimsonswept over her in a sweet flood, so that it seemed to her she felt itwarm on her very shoulders, \'neath her habit, for \'twas Osmonde\'s selfwho had followed and reached her, and uncovered, keeping pace by herside.Ah, what a face he had, and how his eyes burned as they rested on her.  Itwas such a look she met, that for a moment she could not find speech, andhe himself spoke as a man who, through some deep emotion, has almost losthis breath.""My Lady Dunstanwolde,"" he began; and then with a sudden passion,""Clorinda, my beloved!""  The time had come when he could not keepsilence, and with great leapings of her heart she knew.  Yet not one wordsaid she, for she could not; but her beauty, glowing and quivering underhis eyes\' great fire, answered enough.""Were it not that I fear for your sake the beast you ride,"" he said, ""Iwould lay my hand upon his bridle, that I might crush your hand in mine.At post-haste I have come from France, hearing this thing--that youendangered every day that which I love so madly.  My God! beloved, cruel,cruel woman--sure you must know!""She answered with a breathless wild surrender.  ""Yes, yes!"" she gasped,""I know.""""And yet you braved this danger, knowing that you might leave me awidowed man for life.""""But,"" she said, with a smile whose melting radiance seemed akin totears--""but see how I have beaten him--and all is passed.""""Yes, yes,"" he said, ""as you have conquered all--as you have conqueredme--and did from the first hour.  But God forbid that you should make mesuffer so again.""""Your Grace,"" she said, faltering, ""I--I will not!""""Forgive me for the tempest of my passion,"" he said.  ""\'Twas not thus Ihad thought to come to make my suit.  \'Tis scarcely fitting that itshould be so; but I was almost mad when I first heard this rumour,knowing my duty would not loose me to come to you at once--and knowingyou so well, that only if your heart had melted to the one who besoughtyou, you would give up.""""I--give up,"" she answered; ""I give up.""""I worship you,"" he said; ""I worship you.""  And their meeting eyes weredrowned in each other\'s tenderness.They galloped side by side, and the watchers looked on, exchanging wordsand glances, seeing in her beauteous, glowing face, in his joyous one,the final answer to the question they had so often asked each other.\'Twas his Grace of Osmonde who was the happy man, he and no other.  Thatwas a thing plain indeed to be seen, for they were too high above thecommon world to feel that they must play the paltry part of outwardtrifling to deceive it; and as the sun pierces through clouds and isstronger than they, so their love shone like the light of day itselfthrough poor conventions.  They did not know the people gazed andwhispered, and if they had known it, the thing would have counted fornaught with them.""See!"" said my lady, patting her Devil\'s neck--""see, he knows that youhave come, and frets no more.""They rode homeward together, the great beauty and the great duke, and allthe town beheld; and after they had passed him where he stood, John Oxonmounted his own horse and galloped away, white-lipped and with mad eyes.""Let me escort you home,"" the duke had said, ""that I may kneel to youthere, and pour forth my heart as I have so dreamed of doing.  To-morrowI must go back to France, because I left my errand incomplete.  I stolefrom duty the time to come to you, and I must return as quickly as Icame.""  So he took her home; and as they entered the wide hall together,side by side, the attendant lacqueys bowed to the ground in deep,welcoming obeisance, knowing it was their future lord and master theyreceived.Together they went to her own sitting-room, called the Panelled Parlour,a beautiful great room hung with rare pictures, warm with floods of thebright summer sunshine, and perfumed with bowls of summer flowers; and asthe lacquey departed, bowing, and closed the door behind him, they turnedand were enfolded close in each other\'s arms, and stood so, with theirhearts beating as surely it seemed to them human hearts had never beatbefore.""Oh! my dear love, my heavenly love!"" he cried.  ""It has been so long--Ihave lived in prison and in fetters--and it has been so long!""Even as my Lord Dunstanwolde had found cause to wonder at her gentleways, so was this man amazed at her great sweetness, now that he mightcross the threshold of her heart.  She gave of herself as an empressmight give of her store of imperial jewels, with sumptuous lavishness,knowing that the store could not fail.  In truth, it seemed that it mustbe a dream that she so stood before him in all her great, richloveliness, leaning against his heaving breast, her arms as tender as hisown, her regal head thrown backward that they might gaze into the depthsof each other\'s eyes.""From that first hour that I looked up at you,"" she said, ""I knew youwere my lord--my lord!  And a fierce pain stabbed my heart, knowing youhad come too late by but one hour; for had it not been that Dunstanwoldehad led me to you, I knew--ah! how well I knew--that our hearts wouldhave beaten together not as two hearts but as one.""""As they do now,"" he cried.""As they do now,"" she answered--""as they do now!""""And from the moment that your rose fell at my feet and I raised it in myhand,"" he said, ""I knew I held some rapture which was my own.  And whenyou stood before me at Dunstanwolde\'s side and our eyes met, I could notunderstand--nay, I could scarce believe that it had been taken from me.""There, in her arms, among the flowers and in the sweetness of the sun, helived again the past, telling her of the days when, knowing his danger,he had held himself aloof, declining to come to her lord\'s house with thefamiliarity of a kinsman, because the pang of seeing her often was toogreat to bear; and relating to her also the story of the hours when hehad watched her and she had not known his nearness or guessed his pain,when she had passed in her equipage, not seeing him, or giving him but agracious smile.  He had walked outside her window at midnight sometimes,too, coming because he was a despairing man, and could not sleep, andreturning homeward, having found no rest, but only increase of anguish.""Sometimes,"" he said, ""I dared not look into your eyes, fearing my ownwould betray me; but now I can gaze into your soul itself, for themidnight is over--and joy cometh with the morning.""As he had spoken, he had caressed softly with his hand her cheek and hercrown of hair, and such was his great gentleness that \'twas as if hetouched lovingly a child; for into her face there had come that lookwhich it would seem that in the arms of the man she loves every truewoman wears--a look which is somehow like a child\'s in its trusting,sweet surrender and appeal, whatsoever may be her stateliness and thesplendour of her beauty.Yet as he touched her cheek so and her eyes so dwelt on him, suddenly herhead fell heavily upon his breast, hiding her face, even while herunwreathing arms held more closely.""Oh! those mad days before!"" she cried--""Oh! those mad, mad days before!""""Nay, they are long passed, sweet,"" he said, in his deep, noble voice,thinking that she spoke of the wildness of her girlish years--""and allour days of joy are yet to come.""""Yes, yes,"" she cried, clinging closer, yet with shuddering, ""they were_before_--the joy--the joy is all to come.""']"
78,16,Chapter 16,"['XV--In which Sir John Oxon finds again a trophy he had lostHis Grace of Osmonde went back to France to complete his business, andall the world knew that when he returned to England \'twould be to makehis preparations for his marriage with my Lady Dunstanwolde.  It was amarriage not long to be postponed, and her ladyship herself was knownalready to be engaged with lacemen, linen-drapers, toyshop women, andgoldsmiths.  Mercers awaited upon her at her house, accompanied by theirattendants, bearing burdens of brocades and silks, and splendid stuffs ofall sorts.  Her chariot was to be seen standing before their shops, andthe interest in her purchases was so great that fashionable beautieswould contrive to visit the counters at the same hours as herself, sothat they might catch glimpses of what she chose.  In her own great houseall was repressed excitement; her women were enraptured at being allowedthe mere handling and laying away of the glories of her wardrobe; thelacqueys held themselves with greater state, knowing that they were soonto be a duke\'s servants; her little black Nero strutted about, his turbanset upon his pate with a majestic cock, and disdained to enter intobattle with such pages of his own colour as wore only silver collars, hefeeling assured that his own would soon be of gold.The World of Fashion said when her ladyship\'s equipage drove by, that herbeauty was like that of the god of day at morning, and that \'twas plainthat no man or woman had ever beheld her as his Grace of Osmonde would.""She loves at last,"" a wit said.  ""Until the time that such a womanloves, however great her splendour, she is as the sun behind a cloud.""""And now this one hath come forth, and shines so that she warms us inmere passing,"" said another.  ""What eyes, and what a mouth, with thatstrange smile upon it.  Whoever saw such before? and when she came totown with my Lord Dunstanwolde, who, beholding her, would have believedthat she could wear such a look?""In sooth, there was that in her face and in her voice when she spokewhich almost made Anne weep, through its strange sweetness and radiance.\'Twas as if the flood of her joy had swept away all hardness and disdain.Her eyes, which had seemed to mock at all they rested on, mocked no more,but ever seemed to smile at some dear inward thought.One night when she went forth to a Court ball, being all attired inbrocade of white and silver, and glittering with the Dunstanwoldediamonds, which starred her as with great sparkling dewdrops, and yet hadnot the radiance of her eyes and smile, she was so purely wonderful avision that Anne, who had been watching her through all the time when shehad been under the hands of her tirewoman, and beholding her now sodazzling and white a shining creature, fell upon her knees to kiss herhand almost as one who worships.""Oh, sister,"" she said, ""you look like a spirit.  It is as if with theearth you had naught to do--as if your eyes saw Heaven itself and Him whoreigns there.""The lovely orbs of Clorinda shone more still like the great star ofmorning.""Sister Anne,"" she said, laying her hand on her white breast, ""at times Ithink that I must almost be a spirit, I feel such heavenly joy.  It is asif He whom you believe in, and who can forgive and wipe out sins, hasforgiven me, and has granted it to me, that I may begin my poor lifeagain.  Ah!  I will make it better; I will try to make it as near anangel\'s life as a woman can; and I will do no wrong, but only good; and Iwill believe, and pray every day upon my knees--and all my prayers willbe that I may so live that my dear lord--my Gerald--could forgive me allthat I have ever done--and seeing my soul, would know me worthy of him.Oh! we are strange things, we human creatures, Anne,"" with a tremuloussmile; ""we do not believe until we want a thing, and feel that we shalldie if \'tis not granted to us; and then we kneel and kneel and believe,because we _must_ have somewhat to ask help from.""""But all help has been given to you,"" poor tender Anne said, kissing herhand again; ""and I will pray, I will pray--""""Ay, pray, Anne, pray with all thy soul,"" Clorinda answered; ""I need thypraying--and thou didst believe always, and have asked so little that hasbeen given thee.""""Thou wast given me, sister,"" said Anne.  ""Thou hast given me a home andkindness such as I never dared to hope; thou hast been like a great starto me--I have had none other, and I thank Heaven on my knees each nightfor the brightness my star has shed on me.""""Poor Anne, dear Anne!"" Clorinda said, laying her arms about her andkissing her.  ""Pray for thy star, good, tender Anne, that its light maynot be quenched.""  Then with a sudden movement her hand was pressed uponher bosom again.  ""Ah, Anne,"" she cried, and in the music of her voice,agony itself was ringing--""Anne, there is but one thing on this earth Godrules over--but one thing that belongs--_belongs_ to me; and \'tis GeraldMertoun--and he is mine and _shall_ not be taken from me, for he is apart of me, and I a part of him!""""He will not be,"" said Anne--""he will not.""""He cannot,"" Clorinda answered--""he shall not!  \'Twould not be human.""She drew a long breath and was calm again.""Did it reach your ears,"" she said, reclasping a band of jewels on herarm, ""that John Oxon had been offered a place in a foreign Court, andthat \'twas said he would soon leave England?""""I heard some rumour of it,"" Anne answered, her emotion getting thebetter of her usual discreet speech.  ""God grant it may be true!""""Ay!"" said Clorinda, ""would God that he were gone!""But that he was not, for when she entered the assembly that night he wasstanding near the door as though he lay in waiting for her, and his eyesmet hers with a leaping gleam, which was a thing of such exultation thatto encounter it was like having a knife thrust deep into her side andthrough and through it, for she knew full well that he could not wearsuch a look unless he had some strength of which she knew not.This gleam was in his eyes each time she found herself drawn to them, andit seemed as though she could look nowhere without encountering his gaze.He followed her from room to room, placing himself where she could notlift her eyes without beholding him; when she walked a minuet with aroyal duke, he stood and watched her with such a look in his face as drewall eyes towards him.""\'Tis as if he threatens her,"" one said.  ""He has gone mad withdisappointed love.""But \'twas not love that was in his look, but the madness of long-thwartedpassion mixed with hate and mockery; and this she saw, and girded hersoul with all its strength, knowing that she had a fiercer beast to dealwith, and a more vicious and dangerous one, than her horse Devil.  Thathe kept at first at a distance from her, and but looked on with thissecret exultant glow in his bad, beauteous eyes, told her that at last hefelt he held some power in his hands, against which all her defiancewould be as naught.  Till this hour, though she had suffered, and whenalone had writhed in agony of grief and bitter shame, in his presence shehad never flinched.  Her strength she knew was greater than his; but hisbaseness was his weapon, and the depths of that baseness she knew she hadnever reached.At midnight, having just made obeisance before Royalty retiring, she feltthat at length he had drawn near and was standing at her side.""To-night,"" he said, in the low undertone it was his way to keep for suchoccasions, knowing how he could pierce her ear--""to-night you are Juno\'sself--a very Queen of Heaven!""She made no answer.""And I have stood and watched you moving among all lesser goddesses asthe moon sails among the stars, and I have smiled in thinking of whatthese lesser deities would say if they had known what I bear in my breastto-night.""She did not even make a movement--in truth, she felt that at his nextwords she might change to stone.""I have found it,"" he said--""I have it here--the lost treasure--the tressof hair like a raven\'s wing and six feet long.  Is there another woman inEngland who could give a man a lock like it?""She felt then that she had, in sooth, changed to stone; her heart hungwithout moving in her breast; her eyes felt great and hollow and staringas she lifted them to him.""I knew not,"" she said slowly, and with bated breath, for the awfulnessof the moment had even made her body weak as she had never known it feelbefore--""I knew not truly that hell made things like you.""Whereupon he made a movement forward, and the crowd about surged nearerwith hasty exclamations, for the strange weakness of her body hadoverpowered her in a way mysterious to her, and she had changed tomarble, growing too heavy of weight for her sinking limbs.  And those inthe surrounding groups saw a marvellous thing--the same being that myLady Dunstanwolde swayed as she turned, and falling, lay stretched, as ifdead, in her white and silver and flashing jewels at the startledbeholders\' feet.* * * * *She wore no radiant look when she went home that night.  She would gohome alone and unescorted, excepting by her lacqueys, refusing all offersof companionship when once placed in her equipage.  There were, ofcourse, gentlemen who would not be denied leading her to her coach; JohnOxon was among them, and at the last pressed close, with a manner ofgreat ceremony, speaking a final word.""\'Tis useless, your ladyship,"" he murmured, as he made his obeisancegallantly, and though the words were uttered in his lowest tone and withgreat softness, they reached her ear as he intended that they should.  ""To-morrow morning I shall wait upon you.""Anne had forborne going to bed, and waited for her return, longing to seeher spirit\'s face again before she slept; for this poor tender creature,being denied all woman\'s loves and joys by Fate, who had made her as shewas, so lived in her sister\'s beauty and triumphs that \'twas as if insome far-off way she shared them, and herself experienced through themthe joy of being a woman transcendently beautiful and transcendentlybeloved.  To-night she had spent her waiting hours in her closet and uponher knees, praying with all humble adoration of the Being she approached.She was wont to pray long and fervently each day, thanking Heaven for thesmallest things and the most common, and imploring continuance of themercy which bestowed them upon her poor unworthiness.  For her sister herprayers were offered up night and morning, and ofttimes in hours between,and to-night she prayed not for herself at all, but for Clorinda and forhis Grace of Osmonde, that their love might be crowned with happiness,and that no shadow might intervene to cloud its brightness, and thetender rapture in her sister\'s softened look, which was to her a thing sowonderful that she thought of it with reverence as a holy thing.Her prayers being at length ended, she had risen from her knees and satdown, taking a sacred book to read, a book of sermons such as \'twas hersimple habit to pore over with entire respect and child-like faith, andbeing in the midst of her favourite homily, she heard the chariot\'sreturning wheels, and left her chair, surprised, because she had not yetbegun to expect the sound.""\'Tis my sister,"" she said, with a soft, sentimental smile.  ""Osmonde notbeing among the guests, she hath no pleasure in mingling with them.""She went below to the room her ladyship usually went to first on herreturn at night from any gathering, and there she found her sitting asthough she had dropped there in the corner of a great divan, her handshanging clasped before her on her knee, her head hanging forward on herfallen chest, her large eyes staring into space.""Clorinda!  Clorinda!"" Anne cried, running to her and kneeling at herside.  ""Clorinda!  God have mercy!  What is\'t?""Never before had her face worn such a look--\'twas colourless, and sodrawn and fallen in that \'twas indeed almost as if all her great beautywas gone; but the thing most awful to poor Anne was that all the newsoftness seemed as if it had been stamped out, and the fierce hardnesshad come back and was engraven in its place, mingled with a horribledespair.""An hour ago,"" she said, ""I swooned.  That is why I look thus.  \'Tis yetanother sign that I am a woman--a woman!""""You are ill--you swooned?"" cried Anne.  ""I must send for your physician.Have you not ordered that he be sent for yourself?  If Osmonde were here,how perturbed he would be!""""Osmonde!"" said my lady.  ""Gerald!  Is there a Gerald, Anne?""""Sister!"" cried Anne, affrighted by her strange look--""oh, sister!""""I have seen heaven,"" Clorinda said; ""I have stood on the threshold andseen through the part-opened gate--and then have been dragged back tohell.""Anne clung to her, gazing upwards at her eyes, in sheer despair.""But back to hell I will not go,"" she went on saying.  ""Had I not seenHeaven, they might perhaps have dragged me; but now I will not go--I willnot, that I swear!  There is a thing which cannot be endured.  Bear it nowoman should.  Even I, who was not born a woman, but a wolf\'s she-cub, Icannot.  \'Twas not I, \'twas Fate,"" she said--""\'twas not I, \'twasFate--\'twas the great wheel we are bound to, which goes round and roundthat we may be broken on it.  \'Twas not I who bound myself there; and Iwill not be broken so.""She said the words through her clenched teeth, and with all the madpassion of her most lawless years; even at Anne she looked almost in theold ungentle fashion, as though half scorning all weaker than herself,and having small patience with them.""There will be a way,"" she said--""there will be a way.  I shall not swoonagain.""She left her divan and stood upright, the colour having come back to herface; but the look Anne worshipped not having returned with it, \'twas asthough Mistress Clorinda Wildairs had been born again.""To-morrow morning I go forth on Devil,"" she said; ""and I shall be abroadif any visitors come.""What passed in her chamber that night no human being knew.  Anne, wholeft her own apartment and crept into a chamber near hers to lie andwatch, knew that she paced to and fro, but heard no other sound, anddared not intrude upon her.When she came forth in the morning she wore the high look she had beenwont to wear in the years gone by, when she ruled in her father\'s house,and rode to the hunt with a following of gay middle-aged and elderlyrioters.  Her eye was brilliant, and her colour matched it.  She held herhead with the old dauntless carriage, and there was that in her voicebefore which her women quaked, and her lacqueys hurried to do herbidding.Devil himself felt this same thing in the touch of her hand upon hisbridle when she mounted him at the door, and seemed to glance askance ather sideways.She took no servant with her, and did not ride to the Park, but to thecountry.  Once on the highroad, she rode fast and hard, only gallopingstraight before her as the way led, and having no intention.  Where shewas going she knew not; but why she rode on horseback she knew full well,it being because the wild, almost fierce motion was in keeping with thetempest in her soul.  Thoughts rushed through her brain even as sherushed through the air on Devil\'s back, and each leaping after the other,seemed to tear more madly.""What shall I do?"" she was saying to herself.  ""What thing is there forme to do?  I am trapped like a hunted beast, and there is no way forth.""The blood went like a torrent through her veins, so that she seemed tohear it roaring in her ears; her heart thundered in her side, or \'twas soshe thought of it as it bounded, while she recalled the past and lookedupon the present.""What else could have been?"" she groaned.  ""Naught else--naught else.\'Twas a trick--a trick of Fate to ruin me for my punishment.""When she had gone forth it had been with no hope in her breast that herwit might devise a way to free herself from the thing which so beset her,for she had no weak fancies that there dwelt in this base soul any germof honour which might lead it to relenting.  As she had sat in her darkroom at night, crouched upon the floor, and clenching her hands, as themad thoughts went whirling through her brain, she had stared her Fate inthe face and known all its awfulness.  Before her lay the rapture of agreat, sweet, honourable passion, a high and noble life lived in suchbliss as rarely fell to lot of woman--on this one man she knew that shecould lavish all the splendour of her nature, and make his life a heaven,as hers would be.  Behind her lay the mad, uncared-for years, and oneblack memory blighting all to come, though \'twould have been but a blackmemory with no power to blight if the heaven of love had not so opened toher and with its light cast all else into shadow.""If \'twere not love,"" she cried--""if \'twere but ambition, I could defy itto the last; but \'tis love--love--love, and it will kill me to foregoit.""Even as she moaned the words she heard hoof beats near her, and ahorseman leaped the hedge and was at her side.  She set her teeth, andturning, stared into John Oxon\'s face.""Did you think I would not follow you?"" he asked.""No,"" she answered.""I have followed you at a distance hitherto,"" he said; ""now I shallfollow close.""She did not speak, but galloped on.""Think you you can outride me?"" he said grimly, quickening his steed\'space.  ""I go with your ladyship to your own house.  For fear of scandalyou have not openly rebuffed me previous to this time; for a like reasonyou will not order your lacqueys to shut your door when I enter it withyou.""My Lady Dunstanwolde turned to gaze at him again.  The sun shone on hisbright falling locks and his blue eyes as she had seen it shine in dayswhich seemed so strangely long passed by, though they were not five yearsagone.""\'Tis strange,"" she said, with a measure of wonder, ""to live and be soblack a devil.""""Bah! my lady,"" he said, ""these are fine words--and fine words do nothold between us.  Let us leave them.  I would escort you home, and speakto you in private.""  There was that in his mocking that was madness toher, and made her sick and dizzy with the boiling of the blood whichsurged to her brain.  The fury of passion which had been a terror to allabout her when she had been a child was upon her once more, and thoughshe had thought herself freed from its dominion, she knew it again andall it meant.  She felt the thundering beat in her side, the hot floodleaping to her cheek, the flame burning her eyes themselves as if firewas within them.  Had he been other than he was, her face itself wouldhave been a warning.  But he pressed her hard.  As he would have slunkaway a beaten cur if she had held the victory in her hands, so feelingthat the power was his, he exulted over the despairing frenzy which wasin her look.""I pay back old scores,"" he said.  ""There are many to pay.  When youcrowned yourself with roses and set your foot upon my face, your ladyshipthought not of this!  When you gave yourself to Dunstanwolde and spat atme, you did not dream that there could come a time when I might goad asyou did.""She struck Devil with her whip, who leaped forward; but Sir John followedhard behind her.  He had a swift horse too, and urged him fiercely, sothat between these two there was a race as if for life or death.  Thebeasts bounded forward, spurning the earth beneath their feet.  My lady\'sface was set, her eyes were burning flame, her breath came short andpantingly between her teeth.  Oxon\'s fair face was white with passion; hepanted also, but strained every nerve to keep at her side, and keptthere.""Keep back!  I warn thee!"" she cried once, almost gasping.""Keep back!"" he answered, blind with rage.  ""I will follow thee to hell!""And in this wise they galloped over the white road until the hedgesdisappeared and they were in the streets, and people turned to look atthem, and even stood and stared.  Then she drew rein a little and wentslower, knowing with shuddering agony that the trap was closing abouther.""What is it that you would say to me?"" she asked him breathlessly.""That which I would say within four walls that you may hear it all,"" heanswered.  ""This time \'tis not idle threatening.  I have a thing to showyou.""Through the streets they went, and as her horse\'s hoofs beat thepavement, and the passers-by, looking towards her, gazed curiously at sofine a lady on so splendid a brute, she lifted her eyes to the houses,the booths, the faces, and the sky, with a strange fancy that she lookedabout her as a man looks who, doomed to death, is being drawn in his cartto Tyburn tree.  For \'twas to death she went, nor to naught else couldshe compare it, and she was so young and strong, and full of love andlife, and there should have been such bliss and peace before her but forone madness of her all-unknowing days.  And this beside her--this manwith the fair face and looks and beauteous devil\'s eyes, was her hangman,and carried his rope with him, and soon would fit it close about herneck.When they rode through the part of the town where abode the World ofFashion, those who saw them knew them, and marvelled that the two shouldbe together.""But perhaps his love has made him sue for pardon that he has so bornehimself,"" some said, ""and she has chosen to be gracious to him, since sheis gracious in these days to all.""When they reached her house he dismounted with her, wearing an outwardair of courtesy; but his eye mocked her, as she knew.  His horse was in alather of sweat, and he spoke to a servant.""Take my beast home,"" he said.  ""He is too hot to stand, and I shall notsoon be ready.""']"
78,17,Chapter 17,"['XVI--Dealing with that which was done in the Panelled ParlourHe followed her to the Panelled Parlour, the one to which she had takenOsmonde on the day of their bliss, the one in which in the afternoon shereceived those who came to pay court to her over a dish of tea.  In themornings none entered it but herself or some invited guest.  \'Twas notthe room she would have chosen for him; but when he said to her, ""\'Twerebest your ladyship took me to some private place,"" she had known therewas no other so safe.When the door was closed behind them, and they stood face to face, theywere a strange pair to behold--she with mad defiance battling with maddespair in her face; he with the mocking which every woman who had evertrusted him or loved him had lived to see in his face when all was lost.Few men there lived who were as vile as he, his power of villainy lyingin that he knew not the meaning of man\'s shame or honour.""Now,"" she said, ""tell me the worst.""""\'Tis not so bad,"" he answered, ""that a man should claim his own, andswear that no other man shall take it from him.  That I have sworn, andthat I will hold to.""""Your own!"" she said--""your own you call it--villain!""""My own, since I can keep it,"" quoth he.  ""Before you were my Lord ofDunstanwolde\'s you were mine--of your own free will.""""Nay, nay,"" she cried.  ""God! through some madness I knew not theawfulness of--because I was so young and had known naught but evil--andyou were so base and wise.""""Was your ladyship an innocent?"" he answered.  ""It seemed not so to me.""""An innocent of all good,"" she cried--""of all things good on earth--ofall that I know now, having seen manhood and honour.""""His Grace of Osmonde has not been told this,"" he said; ""and I shouldmake it all plain to him.""""What do you ask, devil?"" she broke forth.  ""What is\'t you ask?""""That you shall not be the Duchess of Osmonde,"" he said, drawing near toher; ""that you shall be the wife of Sir John Oxon, as you once calledyourself for a brief space, though no priest had mumbled over us--""""Who was\'t divorced us?"" she said, gasping; ""for I was an honest thing,though I knew no other virtue.  Who was\'t divorced us?""""I confess,"" he answered, bowing, ""that \'twas I--for the time being.  Iwas young, and perhaps fickle--""""And you left me,"" she cried, ""and I found that you had come but for abet--and since I so bore myself that you could not boast, and since I wasnot a rich woman whose fortune would be of use to you, you followedanother and left me--me!""""As his Grace of Osmonde will when I tell him my story,"" he answered.  ""Heis not one to brook that such things can be told of the mother of hisheirs.""She would have shrieked aloud but that she clutched her throat in time.""Tell him!"" she cried, ""tell him, and see if he will hear you.  Your wordagainst mine!""""Think you I do not know that full well,"" he answered, and he broughtforth a little package folded in silk.  ""Why have I done naught butthreaten till this time?  If I went to him without proof, he would run methrough with his sword as I were a mad dog.  But is there another womanin England from whose head her lover could ravish a lock as long andblack as this?""He unfolded the silk, and let other silk unfold itself, a great and thickring of raven hair which uncoiled its serpent length, and though he heldit high, was long enough after surging from his hand to lie upon thefloor.""Merciful God!"" she cried, and shuddering, hid her face.""\'Twas a bet, I own,"" he said; ""I heard too much of the mad beauty andher disdain of men not to be fired by a desire to prove to her andothers, that she was but a woman after all, and so was to be won.  I tookan oath that I would come back some day with a trophy--and this I cutwhen you knew not that I did it.""She clutched her throat again to keep from shrieking in her--impotenthorror.""Devil, craven, and loathsome--and he knows not what he is!"" she gasped.""He is a mad thing who knows not that all his thoughts are of hell.""\'Twas, in sooth, a strange and monstrous thing to see him so unwaveringand bold, flinching before no ignominy, shrinking not to speak openly thething before the mere accusation of which other men\'s blood would haveboiled.""When I bore it away with me,"" he said, ""I lived wildly for a space, andin those days put it in a place of safety, and when I was sober again Ihad forgot where.  Yesterday, by a strange chance, I came upon it.  Thinkyou it can be mistaken for any other woman\'s hair?""At this she held up her hand.""Wait,"" she said.  ""You will go to Osmonde, you will tell him this, youwill--""""I will tell him all the story of the rose garden and of the sun-dial,and the beauty who had wit enough to scorn a man in public that she mightmore safely hold tryst with him alone.  She had great wit and cunning fora beauty of sixteen.  \'Twould be well for her lord to have keen eyes whenshe is twenty.""He should have seen the warning in her eyes, for there was warning enoughin their flaming depths.""All that you can say I know,"" she said--""all that you can say!  And Ilove him.  There is no other man on earth.  Were he a beggar, I wouldtramp the highroad by his side and go hungered with him.  He is my lord,and I his mate--his mate!""""That you will not be,"" he answered, made devilish by her words.  ""He isa high and noble gentleman, and wants no man\'s cast-off plaything for hiswife.""Her breast leaped up and down in her panting as she pressed her hand uponit; her breath came in sharp puffs through her nostrils.""And once,"" she breathed--""and once--I _loved_ thee--cur!""He was mad with exultant villainy and passion, and he broke into a laugh.""Loved me!"" he said.  ""Thou!  As thou lovedst me--and as thou lovesthim--so will Moll Easy love any man--for a crown.""Her whip lay upon the table, she caught and whirled it in the air.  Shewas blind with the surging of her blood, and saw not how she caught orheld it, or what she did--only that she struck!And \'twas his temple that the loaded weapon met, and \'twas wielded by awrist whose sinews were of steel, and even as it struck he gasped,casting up his hands, and thereupon fell, and lay stretched at her feet!But the awful tempest which swept over her had her so under its dominionthat she was like a branch whirled on the wings of the storm.  She scarcenoted that he fell, or noting it, gave it not one thought as she dashedfrom one end of the apartment to the other with the fierce striding of amad woman.""Devil!"" she cried, ""and cur! and for thee I blasted all the years tocome!  To a beast so base I gave all that an empress\' self could give--alllife--all love--for ever.  And he comes back--shameless--to barter like acheating huckster, because his trade goes ill, and I--I could stock hiscounters once again.""She strode towards him, raving.""Think you I do not know, woman\'s bully and poltroon, that you plot tosell yourself, because your day has come, and no woman will bid for suchan outcast, saving one that you may threaten.  Rise, vermin--rise, lest Ikill thee!""In her blind madness she lashed him once across the face again.  And hestirred not--and something in the resistless feeling of the flesh beneaththe whip, and in the quiet of his lying, caused her to pause and standpanting and staring at the thing which lay before her.  For it was aThing, and as she stood staring, with wild heaving breast, this she saw.\'Twas but a thing--a thing lying inert, its fair locks outspread, itseyes rolled upward till the blue was almost lost; a purple indentation onthe right temple from which there oozed a tiny thread of blood.* * * * *""There will be a way,"" she had said, and yet in her most mad despair, ofthis way she had never thought; though strange it had been, consideringher lawless past, that she had not--never of this way--never!Notwithstanding which, in one frenzied moment in which she had knownnaught but her delirium, her loaded whip had found it for her--the way!And yet it being so found, and she stood staring, seeing what she haddone--seeing what had befallen--\'twas as if the blow had been struck notat her own temple but at her heart--a great and heavy shock, which lefther bloodless, and choked, and gasping.""What! what!"" she panted.  ""Nay! nay! nay!"" and her eyes grew wide andwild.She sank upon her knees, so shuddering that her teeth began to chatter.She pushed him and shook him by the shoulder.""Stir!"" she cried in a loud whisper.  ""Move thee!  Why dost thou lie so?Stir!""Yet he stirred not, but lay inert, only with his lips drawn back, showinghis white teeth a little, as if her horrid agony made him begin to laugh.Shuddering, she drew slowly nearer, her eyes more awful than his own.  Herhand crept shaking to his wrist and clutched it.  There was naughtastir--naught!  It stole to his breast, and baring it, pressed close.That was still and moveless as his pulse; for life was ended, and ahundred mouldering years would not bring more of death.""I have _killed_ thee,"" she breathed.  ""I have _killed_ thee--though Imeant it not--even hell itself doth know.  Thou art a dead man--and thisis the worst of all!""His hand fell heavily from hers, and she still knelt staring, such a lookcoming into her face as throughout her life had never been therebefore--for \'twas the look of a creature who, being tortured, the worstat last being reached, begins to smile at Fate.""I have killed him!"" she said, in a low, awful voice; ""and he lieshere--and outside people walk, and know not.  But _he_ knows--and I--andas he lies methinks he smiles--knowing what he has done!""She crouched even lower still, the closer to behold him, and indeed itseemed his still face sneered as if defying her now to rid herself ofhim!  \'Twas as though he lay there mockingly content, saying, ""Now that Ilie here, \'tis for _you_--for _you_ to move me.""She rose and stood up rigid, and all the muscles of her limbs were drawnas though she were a creature stretched upon a rack; for the horror ofthis which had befallen her seemed to fill the place about her, and leaveher no air to breathe nor light to see.""Now!"" she cried, ""if I would give way--and go mad, as I could but do,for there is naught else left--if I would but give way, that which isI--and has lived but a poor score of years--would be done with for alltime.  All whirls before me.  \'Twas I who struck the blow--and I am awoman--and I could go raving--and cry out and call them in, and point tohim, and tell them how \'twas done--all!--all!""She choked, and clutched her bosom, holding its heaving down so fiercelythat her nails bruised it through her habit\'s cloth; for she felt thatshe had begun to rave already, and that the waves of such a tempest werearising as, if not quelled at their first swell, would sweep her from herfeet and engulf her for ever.""That--that!"" she gasped--""nay--that I swear I will not do!  There wasalways One who hated me--and doomed and hunted me from the hour I lay\'neath my dead mother\'s corpse, a new-born thing.  I know not whom itwas--or why--or how--but \'twas so!  I was made evil, and cast helplessamid evil fates, and having done the things that were ordained, and therewas no escape from, I was shown noble manhood and high honour, and taughtto worship, as I worship now.  An angel might so love and be made higher.And at the gate of heaven a devil grins at me and plucks me back, andtaunts and mires me, and I fall--on _this_!""She stretched forth her arms in a great gesture, wherein it seemed thatsurely she defied earth and heaven.""No hope--no mercy--naught but doom and hell,"" she cried, ""unless thething that is tortured be the stronger.  Now--unless Fate bray mesmall--the stronger I will be!""She looked down at the thing before her.  How its stone face sneered, andeven in its sneering seemed to disregard her.  She knelt by it again, herblood surging through her body, which had been cold, speaking as if shewould force her voice to pierce its deadened ear.""Ay, mock!"" she said, setting her teeth, ""thinking that I amconquered--yet am I not!  \'Twas an honest blow struck by a creaturegoaded past all thought!  Ay, mock--and yet, but for one man\'s sake,would I call in those outside and stand before them, crying: \'Here is avillain whom I struck in madness--and he lies dead!  I ask not mercy, butonly justice.\'""She crouched still nearer, her breath and words coming hard and quick.\'Twas indeed as if she spoke to a living man who heard--as if sheanswered what he had said.""There would be men in England who would give it me,"" she raved,whispering.  ""That would there, I swear!  But there would be dullards anddastards who would not.  He would give it--he!  Ay, mock as thou wilt!But between his high honour and love and me thy carrion _shall_ notcome!""By her great divan the dead man had fallen, and so near to it he lay thatone arm was hidden by the draperies; and at this moment this shesaw--before having seemed to see nothing but the death in his face.  Athought came to her like a flame lit on a sudden, and springing high theinstant the match struck the fuel it leaped from.  It was a thought sodaring and so strange that even she gasped once, being appalled, and herhands, stealing to her brow, clutched at the hair that grew there,feeling it seem to rise and stand erect.""Is it madness to so dare?"" she said hoarsely, and for an instant,shuddering, hid her eyes, but then uncovered and showed them burning.""Nay! not as I will dare it,"" she said, ""for it will make me steel.  Youfell well,"" she said to the stone-faced thing, ""and as you lie there,seem to tell me what to do, in your own despite.  You would not have sohelped me had you known.  Now \'tis \'twixt Fate and I--a human thing--whois but a hunted woman.""She put her strong hand forth and thrust him--he was alreadystiffening--backward from the shoulder, there being no shrinking on herface as she felt his flesh yield beneath her touch, for she had passedthe barrier lying between that which is mere life and that which ispitiless hell, and could feel naught that was human.  A poor wild beastat bay, pressed on all sides by dogs, by huntsmen, by resistless weapons,by Nature\'s pitiless self--glaring with bloodshot eyes, panting, withfangs bared in the savagery of its unfriended agony--might feel thus.\'Tis but a hunted beast; but \'tis alone, and faces so the terror andanguish of death.The thing gazing with its set sneer, and moving but stiffly, she putforth another hand upon its side and thrust it farther backward until itlay stretched beneath the great broad seat, its glazed and open eyesseeming to stare upward blankly at the low roof of its strange prison;she thrust it farther backward still, and letting the draperies fall,steadily and with care so rearranged them that all was safe and hid fromsight.""Until to-night,"" she said, ""you will lie well there.  And then--andthen--""She picked up the long silken lock of hair which lay like a serpent ather feet, and threw it into the fire, watching it burn, as all hairburns, with slow hissing, and she watched it till \'twas gone.Then she stood with her hands pressed upon her eyeballs and her brow, herthoughts moving in great leaps.  Although it reeled, the brain which hadworked for her ever, worked clear and strong, setting before her what wasimpending, arguing her case, showing her where dangers would arise, howshe must provide against them, what she must defend and set at defiance.The power of will with which she had been endowed at birth, and which hadbut grown stronger by its exercise, was indeed to be compared to somegreat engine whose lever \'tis not nature should be placed in human hands;but on that lever her hand rested now, and to herself she vowed she wouldcontrol it, since only thus might she be saved.  The torture she hadundergone for months, the warring of the evil past with the noblepresent, of that which was sweet and passionately loving woman with thatwhich was all but devil, had strung her to a pitch so intense and highthat on the falling of this unnatural and unforeseen blow she was leftscarce a human thing.  Looking back, she saw herself a creature doomedfrom birth; and here in one moment seemed to stand a force ranged in madbattle with the fate which had doomed her.""\'Twas ordained that the blow should fall so,"" she said, ""and those whodid it laugh--laugh at me.""\'Twas but a moment, and her sharp breathing became even and regular asthough at her command; her face composed itself, and she turned to thebell and rang it as with imperious haste.When the lacquey entered, she was standing holding papers in her hand asif she had but just been consulting them.""Follow Sir John Oxon,"" she commanded.  ""Tell him I have forgot animportant thing and beg him to return at once.  Lose no time.  He has butjust left me and can scarce be out of sight.""The fellow saw there was no time to lose.  They all feared that imperialeye of hers and fled to obey its glances.  Bowing, he turned, andhastened to do her bidding, fearing to admit that he had not seen theguest leave, because to do so would be to confess that he had been absentfrom his post, which was indeed the truth.She knew he would come back shortly, and thus he did, entering somewhatbreathed by his haste.""My lady,"" he said, ""I went quickly to the street, and indeed to thecorner of it, but Sir John was not within sight.""""Fool, you were not swift enough!"" she said angrily.  ""Wait, you must goto his lodgings with a note.  The matter is of importance.""She went to a table--\'twas close to the divan, so close that if she hadthrust forth her foot she could have touched what lay beneath it--andwrote hastily a few lines.  They were to request that which wasstiffening within three feet of her to return to her as quickly aspossible that she might make inquiries of an important nature which shehad forgotten at his departure.""Take this to Sir John\'s lodgings,"" she said.  ""Let there be no loiteringby the way.  Deliver into his own hands, and bring back at once hisanswer.""Then she was left alone again, and being so left, paced the room slowly,her gaze upon the floor.""That was well done,"" she said.  ""When he returns and has not found him,I will be angered, and send him again to wait.""She stayed her pacing, and passed her hand across her face.""\'Tis like a nightmare,"" she said--""as if one dreamed, and choked, andpanted, and would scream aloud, but could not.  I cannot!  I must not!Would that I might shriek, and dash myself upon the floor, and beat myhead upon it until I lay--as _he_ does.""She stood a moment, breathing fast, her eyes widening, that part of herwhich was weak woman for the moment putting her in parlous danger,realising the which she pressed her sides with hands that were of steel.""Wait! wait!"" she said to herself.  ""This is going mad.  This isloosening hold, and being beaten by that One who hates me and laughs tosee what I have come to.""Naught but that unnatural engine of will could have held her withinbounds and restrained the mounting female weakness that beset her; butthis engine being stronger than all else, it beat her womanish andswooning terrors down.""Through this one day I must live,"" she said, ""and plan, and guard eachmoment that doth pass.  My face must tell no tale, my voice must hintnone.  He will be still--God knows he will be still enough.""Upon the divan itself there had been lying a little dog; \'twas a KingCharles\' spaniel, a delicate pampered thing, which attached itself toher, and was not easily driven away.  Once during the last hour thefierce, ill-hushed voices had disturbed it, and it had given vent to afretted bark, but being a luxurious little beast, it had soon curled upamong its cushions and gone to sleep again.  But as its mistress walkedabout muttering low words and ofttimes breathing sharp breaths, it becamedisturbed again.  Perhaps through some instinct of which naught is knownby human creatures, it felt the strange presence of a thing which rousedit.  It stirred, at first drowsily, and lifted its head and sniffed; thenit stretched its limbs, and having done so, stood up, turning on itsmistress a troubled eye, and this she saw and stopped to meet it.  \'Twasa strange look she bestowed upon it, a startled and fearful one; herthought drew the blood up to her cheek, but backward again it flowed whenthe little beast lifted its nose and gave a low but woeful howl.  Twiceit did this, and then jumped down, and standing before the edge of thecouch, stood there sniffing.There was no mistake, some instinct of which it knew not the meaning hadset it on, and it would not be thrust back.  In all beasts this strangething has been remarked--that they know that which ends them all, and sorevolt against it that they cannot be at rest so long as it is near them,but must roar, or whinny, or howl until \'tis out of the reach of theirscent.  And so \'twas plain this little beast knew and was afraid andrestless.  He would not let it be, but roved about, sniffing and whining,and not daring to thrust his head beneath the falling draperies, butgrowing more and yet more excited and terrified, until at last hestopped, raised head in air, and gave vent to a longer, louder, and moredolorous howl, and albeit to one with so strange and noticeable a soundthat her heart turned over in her breast as she stooped and caught him inher grasp, and shuddered as she stood upright, holding him to her side,her hand over his mouth.  But he would not be hushed, and struggled toget down as if indeed he would go mad unless he might get to the thingand rave at it.""If I send thee from the room thou wilt come back, poor Frisk,"" she said.""There will be no keeping thee away, and I have never ordered thee awaybefore.  Why couldst thou not keep still?  Nay, \'twas not dog nature.""That it was not so was plain by his struggles and the yelps but poorlystifled by her grasp.She put her hand about his little neck, turning, in sooth, very pale.""Thou too, poor little beast,"" she said.  ""Thou too, who art so small athing and never harmed me.""When the lacquey came back he wore an air more timorous than before.""Your ladyship,"" he faltered, ""Sir John had not yet reached his lodgings.His servant knew not when he might expect him.""""In an hour go again and wait,"" she commanded.  ""He must return ere longif he has not left town.""And having said this, pointed to a little silken heap which layoutstretched limp upon the floor.  ""\'Tis poor Frisk, who has had somestrange spasm, and fell, striking his head.  He hath been ailing fordays, and howled loudly but an hour ago.  Take him away, poor beast.""']"
78,18,Chapter 18,"['XVII--Wherein his Grace of Osmonde\'s courier arrives from FranceThe stronghold of her security lay in the fact that her household sostood in awe of her, and that this room, which was one of the richest andmost beautiful, though not the largest, in the mansion, all her servitorshad learned to regard as a sort of sacred place in which none dared toset foot unless invited or commanded to enter.  Within its four walls sheread and wrote in the morning hours, no servant entering unless summonedby her; and the apartment seeming, as it were, a citadel, none approachedwithout previous parley.  In the afternoon the doors were thrown open,and she entertained there such visitors as came with less formality thanstatelier assemblages demanded.  When she went out of it this morning togo to her chamber that her habit might be changed and her toilette made,she glanced about her with a steady countenance.""Until the babblers flock in to chatter of the modes and playhouses,"" shesaid, ""all will be as quiet as the grave.  Then I must stand near, andplan well, and be in such beauty and spirit that they will see naught butme.""In the afternoon \'twas the fashion for those who had naught more seriousin their hands than the killing of time to pay visits to each other\'shouses, and drinking dishes of tea, to dispose of their neighbours\'characters, discuss the playhouses, the latest fashions in furbelows orcommodes, and make love either lightly or with serious intent.  One maybe sure that at my Lady Dunstanwolde\'s many dishes of Bohea were drunk,and many ogling glances and much witticism exchanged.  There was in thesedays even a greater following about her than ever.  A triumphant beautyon the verge of becoming a great duchess is not like to be neglected byher acquaintance, and thus her ladyship held assemblies both gay andbrilliantly varied, which were the delight of the fashionable triflers ofthe day.This afternoon they flocked in greater numbers than usual.  The episodeof the breaking of Devil, the unexpected return of his Grace of Osmonde,the preparations for the union, had given an extra stimulant to thatinterest in her ladyship which was ever great enough to need none.Thereunto was added the piquancy of the stories of the noticeabledemeanour of Sir John Oxon, of what had seemed to be so plain a rebellionagainst his fate, and also of my lady\'s open and cold displeasure at themanner of his bearing himself as a disappointed man who presumed to showanger against that to which he should gallantly have been resigned, asone who is conquered by the chance of war.  Those who had beheld the tworide homeward together in the morning, were full of curiousness, and oneand another, mentioning the matter, exchanged glances, speaking plainlyof desire to know more of what had passed, and of hope that chance mightthrow the two together again in public, where more of interest might begathered.  It seemed indeed not unlikely that Sir John might appear amongthe tea-bibbers, and perchance \'twas for this lively reason that mylady\'s room was this afternoon more than usually full of gay spirits andgossip-loving ones.They found, however, only her ladyship\'s self and her sister, MistressAnne, who, of truth, did not often join her tea-parties, finding them sogiven up to fashionable chatter and worldly witticisms that she feltherself somewhat out of place.  The world knew Mistress Anne but as adull, plain gentlewoman, whom her more brilliant and fortunate sistergave gracious protection to, and none missed her when she was absent, orobserved her greatly when she appeared upon the scene.  To-day she wasperchance more observed than usual, because her pallor was so great acontrast to her ladyship\'s splendour of beauty and colour.  The contrastbetween them was ever a great one; but this afternoon Mistress Anne\'salways pale countenance seemed almost livid, there were rings of pain orillness round her eyes, and her features looked drawn and pinched.  MyLady Dunstanwolde, clad in a great rich petticoat of crimson floweredsatin, with wondrous yellow Mechlin for her ruffles, and with herglorious hair dressed like a tower, looked taller, more goddess-like andfull of splendid fire than ever she had been before beheld, or so hervisitors said to her and to each other; though, to tell the truth, thiswas no new story, she being one of those women having the curious powerof inspiring the beholder with the feeling each time he encountered themthat he had never before seen them in such beauty and bloom.When she had come down the staircase from her chamber, Anne, who had beenstanding at the foot, had indeed started somewhat at the sight of herrich dress and brilliant hues.""Why do you jump as if I were a ghost, Anne?"" she asked.  ""Do I look likeone?  My looking-glass did not tell me so.""""No,"" said Anne; ""you--are so--so crimson and splendid--and I--""Her ladyship came swiftly down the stairs to her.""You are not crimson and splendid,"" she said.  ""\'Tis you who are a ghost.What is it?""Anne let her soft, dull eyes rest upon her for a moment helplessly, andwhen she replied her voice sounded weak.""I think--I am ill, sister,"" she said.  ""I seem to tremble and feelfaint.""""Go then to bed and see the physician.  You must be cared for,"" said herladyship.  ""In sooth, you look ill indeed.""""Nay,"" said Anne; ""I beg you, sister, this afternoon let me be with you;it will sustain me.  You are so strong--let me--""She put out her hand as if to touch her, but it dropped at her side asthough its strength was gone.""But there will be many babbling people,"" said her sister, with a curiouslook.  ""You do not like company, and these days my rooms are full.  \'Twillirk and tire you.""""I care not for the people--I would be with you,"" Anne said, in strangeimploring.  ""I have a sick fancy that I am afraid to sit alone in mychamber.  \'Tis but weakness.  Let me this afternoon be with you.""""Go then and change your robe,"" said Clorinda, ""and put some red uponyour cheeks.  You may come if you will.  You are a strange creature,Anne.""And thus saying, she passed into her apartment.  As there are blows andpain which end in insensibility or delirium, so there are catastrophesand perils which are so great as to produce something near akin to these.As she had stood before her mirror in her chamber watching herreflection, while her woman attired her in her crimson flowered satin andbuilded up her stately head-dress, this other woman had felt that thehour when she could have shrieked and raved and betrayed herself hadpassed by, and left a deadness like a calm behind, as though horror hadstunned all pain and yet left her senses clear.  She forgot not the thingwhich lay staring upward blankly at the under part of the couch which hidit--the look of its fixed eyes, its outspread locks, and the purpleindentation on the temple she saw as clearly as she had seen them in thatfirst mad moment when she had stood staring downward at the thing itself;but the coursing of her blood was stilled, the gallop of her pulses, andthat wild hysteric leaping of her heart into her throat, choking her andforcing her to gasp and pant in that way which in women must ever end inshrieks and cries and sobbing beatings of the air.  But for the femininesoftness to which her nature had given way for the first time, since thepower of love had mastered her, there was no thing of earth could havehappened to her which would have brought this rolling ball to her throat,this tremor to her body--since the hour of her birth she had never beenattacked by such a female folly, as she would indeed have regarded itonce; but now \'twas different--for a while she had been a woman--a womanwho had flung herself upon the bosom of him who was her soul\'s lord, andresting there, her old rigid strength had been relaxed.But \'twas not this woman who had known tender yielding who returned totake her place in the Panelled Parlour, knowing of the companion whowaited near her unseen--for it was as her companion she thought of him,as she had thought of him when he followed her in the Mall, forcedhimself into her box at the play, or stood by her shoulder at assemblies;he had placed himself by her side again, and would stay there until shecould rid herself of him.""After to-night he will be gone, if I act well my part,"" she said, ""andthen may I live a freed woman.""\'Twas always upon the divan she took her place when she received hervisitors, who were accustomed to finding her enthroned there.  Thisafternoon when she came into the room she paused for a space, and stoodbeside it, the parlour being yet empty.  She felt her face grow a littlecold, as if it paled, and her under-lip drew itself tight across herteeth.""In a graveyard,"" she said, ""I have sat upon the stone ledge of a tomb,and beneath there was--worse than this, could I but have seen it.  Thisis no more.""When the Sir Humphreys and Lord Charleses, Lady Bettys and MistressLovelys were announced in flocks, fluttering and chattering, she rosefrom her old place to meet them, and was brilliant graciousness itself.She hearkened to their gossipings, and though \'twas not her way to joinin them, she was this day witty in such way as robbed them of the dulnessin which sometimes gossip ends.  It was a varied company which gatheredabout her; but to each she gave his or her moment, and in that momentsaid that which they would afterwards remember.  With those of the Courtshe talked royalty, the humours of her Majesty, the severities of herGrace of Marlborough; with statesmen she spoke with such intellect anddiscretion that they went away pondering on the good fortune which hadbefallen one man when it seemed that it was of such proportions as mighthave satisfied a dozen, for it seemed not fair to them that his Grace ofOsmonde, having already rank, wealth, and fame, should have added to thema gift of such magnificence as this beauteous woman would bring; withbeaux and wits she made dazzling jests; and to the beauties who desiredtheir flatteries she gave praise so adroit that they were stimulated toplume their feathers afresh and cease to fear the rivalry of herloveliness.And yet while she so bore herself, never once did she cease to feel thepresence of that which, lying near, seemed to her racked soul as one wholay and listened with staring eyes which mocked; for there was a thoughtwhich would not leave her, which was, that it could hear, that it couldsee through the glazing on its blue orbs, and that knowing itself boundby the moveless irons of death and dumbness it impotently raged andcursed that it could not burst them and shriek out its vengeance, rollingforth among her worshippers at their feet and hers.""But he _can_ not,"" she said, within her clenched teeth, again andagain--""_that_ he cannot.""Once as she said this to herself she caught Anne\'s eyes fixed helplesslyupon her, it seeming to be as the poor woman had said, that her weaknesscaused her to desire to abide near her sister\'s strength and draw supportfrom it; for she had remained at my lady\'s side closely since she haddescended to the room, and now seemed to implore some protection forwhich she was too timid to openly make request.""You are too weak to stay, Anne,"" her ladyship said.  ""\'Twould be betterthat you should retire.""""I am weak,"" the poor thing answered, in low tones--""but not too weak tostay.  I am always weak.  Would that I were of your strength and courage.Let me sit down--sister--here.""  She touched the divan\'s cushions with ashaking hand, gazing upward wearily--perchance remembering that thisplace seemed ever a sort of throne none other than the hostess queenherself presumed to encroach upon.""You are too meek, poor sister,"" quoth Clorinda.  ""\'Tis not a chair ofcoronation or the woolsack of a judge.  Sit! sit!--and let me call forwine!""She spoke to a lacquey and bade him bring the drink, for even as she sankinto her place Anne\'s cheeks grew whiter.When \'twas brought, her ladyship poured it forth and gave it to hersister with her own hand, obliging her to drink enough to bring hercolour back.  Having seen to this, she addressed the servant who hadobeyed her order.""Hath Jenfry returned from Sir John Oxon?"" she demanded, in that clear,ringing voice of hers, whose music ever arrested those surrounding her,whether they were concerned in her speech or no; but now all feltsufficient interest to prick up ears and hearken to what was said.""No, my lady,"" the lacquey answered.  ""He said that you had bidden him towait.""""But not all day, poor fool,"" she said, setting down Anne\'s empty glassupon the salver.  ""Did he think I bade him stand about the door allnight?  Bring me his message when he comes.""""\'Tis ever thus with these dull serving folk,"" she said to those nearesther.  ""One cannot pay for wit with wages and livery.  They can but obeythe literal word.  Sir John, leaving me in haste this morning, I forgot aquestion I would have asked, and sent a lacquey to recall him.""Anne sat upright.""Sister--I pray you--another glass of wine.""My lady gave it to her at once, and she drained it eagerly.""Was he overtaken?"" said a curious matron, who wished not to see thesubject closed.""No,"" quoth her ladyship, with a light laugh--""though he must have beenin haste, for the man was sent after him in but a moment\'s time.  \'Twasthen I told the fellow to go later to his lodgings and deliver my messageinto Sir John\'s own hand, whence it seems that he thinks that he mustawait him till he comes.""Upon a table near there lay the loaded whip; for she had felt it bolderto let it lie there as if forgotten, because her pulse had sprung so atfirst sight of it when she came down, and she had so quailed before thedesire to thrust it away, to hide it from her sight.  ""And that I quailbefore,"" she had said, ""I must have the will to face--or I am lost.""  Soshe had let it stay.A languishing beauty, with melting blue eyes and a pretty fashion of everkeeping before the world of her admirers her waxen delicacy, lifted theheavy thing in her frail white hand.""How can your ladyship wield it?"" she said.  ""It is so heavy for awoman--but your ladyship is--is not--""""Not quite a woman,"" said the beautiful creature, standing at her fullgreat height, and smiling down at this blue and white piece of frailtywith the flashing splendour of her eyes.""Not quite a woman,"" cried two wits at once.  ""A goddess rather--anOlympian goddess.""The languisher could not endure comparisons which so seemed to disparageher ethereal charms.  She lifted the weapon with a great effort, whichshowed the slimness of her delicate fair wrist and the sweet tracery ofblue veins upon it.""Nay,"" she said lispingly, ""it needs the muscle of a great man to liftit.  I could not hold it--much less beat with it a horse.""  And to showhow coarse a strength was needed and how far her femininity lacked suchvigour, she dropped it upon the floor--and it rolled beneath the edge ofthe divan.""Now,"" the thought shot through my lady\'s brain, as a bolt shoots fromthe sky--""now--he _laughs_!""She had no time to stir--there were upon their knees three beaux at once,and each would sure have thrust his arm below the seat and rummaged, hadnot God saved her!  Yes, \'twas of God she thought in that terrible madsecond--God!--and only a mind that is not human could have told why.For Anne--poor Mistress Anne--white-faced and shaking, was before themall, and with a strange adroitness stooped,--and thrust her hand below,and drawing the thing forth, held it up to view.""\'Tis here,"" she said, ""and in sooth, sister, I wonder not at itsfalling--its weight is so great.""Clorinda took it from her hand.""I shall break no more beasts like Devil,"" she said, ""and for quieterones it weighs too much; I shall lay it by.""She crossed the room and laid it upon a shelf.""It was ever heavy--but for Devil.  \'Tis done with,"" she said; and therecame back to her face--which for a second had lost hue--a flood ofcrimson so glowing, and a smile so strange, that those who looked andheard, said to themselves that \'twas the thought of Osmonde who had sochanged her, which made her blush.  But a few moments later they beheldthe same glow mount again.  A lacquey entered, bearing a salver on whichlay two letters.  One was a large one, sealed with a ducal coronet, andthis she saw first, and took in her hand even before the man had time tospeak.""His Grace\'s courier has arrived from France,"" he said; ""the package wasordered to be delivered at once.""""It must be that his Grace returns earlier than we had hoped,"" she said,and then the other missive caught her eye.""\'Tis your ladyship\'s own,"" the lacquey explained somewhat anxiously.""\'Twas brought back, Sir John not having yet come home, and Jenfry havingwaited three hours.""""\'Twas long enough,"" quoth her ladyship.  ""\'Twill do to-morrow.""She did not lay Osmonde\'s letter aside, but kept it in her hand, andseeing that she waited for their retirement to read it, her guests beganto make their farewells.  One by one or in groups of twos and threes theyleft her, the men bowing low, and going away fretted by the memory of thepicture she made--a tall and regal figure in her flowered crimson, herstateliness seeming relaxed and softened by the mere holding of thesealed missive in her hand.  But the women were vaguely envious, not ofOsmonde, but of her before whom there lay outspread as far as life\'shorizon reached, a future of such perfect love and joy; for GeraldMertoun had been marked by feminine eyes since his earliest youth, andhad seemed to embody all that woman\'s dreams or woman\'s ambitions or herlove could desire.When the last was gone, Clorinda turned, tore her letter open, and heldit hard to her lips.  Before she read a word she kissed it passionately ascore of times, paying no heed that Anne sate gazing at her; and havingkissed it so, she fell to reading it, her cheeks warm with the glow of asweet and splendid passion, her bosom rising and falling in a tempest oftender, fluttering breaths--and \'twas these words her eyes devoured:   ""If I should head this page I write to you \'Goddess and Queen, and   Empress of my deepest soul,\' what more should I be saying than \'My   Love\' and \'My Clorinda,\' since these express all the soul of man could   crave for or his body desire.  The body and soul of me so long for   thee, sweetheart, and sweetest beautiful woman that the hand of Nature   ever fashioned for the joy of mortals, that I have had need to pray   Heaven\'s help to aid me to endure the passing of the days that lie   between me and the hour which will make me the most strangely,   rapturously, happy man, not in England, not in the world, but in all   God\'s universe.  I must pray Heaven again, and indeed do and will, for   humbleness which shall teach me to remember that I am not deity, but   mere man--mere man--though I shall hold a goddess to my breast and   gaze into eyes which are like deep pools of Paradise, and yet answer   mine with the marvel of such love as none but such a soul could make a   woman\'s, and so fit to mate with man\'s.  In the heavy days when I was   wont to gaze at you from afar with burning heart, my unceasing anguish   was that even high honour itself could not subdue and conquer the   thoughts which leaped within me even as my pulse leaped, and even as   my pulse could not be stilled unless by death.  And one that for ever   haunted--aye, and taunted--me was the image of how your tall, beauteous   body would yield itself to a strong man\'s arm, and your noble head   with its heavy tower of hair resting upon his shoulder--the centres of   his very being would be thrilled and shaken by the uplifting of such   melting eyes as surely man ne\'er gazed within on earth before, and the   ripe and scarlet bow of a mouth so beauteous and so sweet with   womanhood.  This beset me day and night, and with such torture that I   feared betimes my brain might reel and I become a lost and ruined   madman.  And now--it is no more forbidden me to dwell upon it--nay, I   lie waking at night, wooing the picture to me, and at times I rise   from my dreams to kneel by my bedside and thank God that He hath given   me at last what surely is my own!--for so it seems to me, my love, that   each of us is but a part of the other, and that such forces of Nature   rush to meet together in us, that Nature herself would cry out were we   rent apart.  If there were aught to rise like a ghost between us, if   there were aught that could sunder us--noble soul, let us but swear   that it shall weld us but the closer together, and that locked in each   other\'s arms its blows shall not even make our united strength to   sway.  Sweetest lady, your lovely lip will curve in smiles, and you   will say, \'He is mad with his joy--my Gerald\' (for never till my heart   stops at its last beat and leaves me still, a dead man, cold upon my   bed, can I forget the music of your speech when you spoke those words,   \'My Gerald!  My Gerald.\')  And indeed I crave your pardon, for a man   so filled with rapture cannot be quite sane, and sometimes I wonder if   I walk through the palace gardens like one who is drunk, so does my   brain reel.  But soon, my heavenly, noble love, my exile will be over,   and this is in truth what my letter is to tell you, that in four days   your lacqueys will throw open your doors to me and I shall enter, and   being led to you, shall kneel at your feet and kiss the hem of your   robe, and then rise standing to fold her who will so soon be my very   wife to my throbbing breast.""Back to her face had come all the softness which had been lost, the hardlines were gone, the tender curves had returned, her lashes looked as ifthey were moist.  Anne, sitting rigidly and gazing at her, was afraid tospeak, knowing that she was not for the time on earth, but that the soundof a voice would bring her back to it, and that \'twas well she should beaway as long as she might.She read the letter, not once, but thrice, dwelling upon every word,\'twas plain; and when she had reached the last one, turning back thepages and beginning again.  When she looked up at last, \'twas with analmost wild little smile, for she had indeed for that one momentforgotten.""Locked in each other\'s arms,"" she said--""locked in each other\'s arms.  MyGerald!  My Gerald!  \'What surely is my own--my own\'!""Anne rose and came to her, laying her hand on her arm.  She spoke in avoice low, hushed, and strained.""Come away, sister,"" she said, ""for a little while--come away.""']"
78,19,Chapter 19,"['XVIII--My Lady Dunstanwolde sits late alone and writesThat she must leave the Panelled Parlour at her usual hour, or attractattention by doing that to which her household was unaccustomed, she wellknew, her manner of life being ever stately and ceremonious in itsregularity.  When she dined at home she and Anne partook of their repasttogether in the large dining-room, the table loaded with silver dishesand massive glittering glass, their powdered, gold-laced lacqueys inattendance, as though a score of guests had shared the meal with them.Since her lord\'s death there had been nights when her ladyship had satlate writing letters and reading documents pertaining to her estates, themanagement of which, though in a measure controlled by stewards andattorneys, was not left to them, as the business of most great ladies isgenerally left to others.  All papers were examined by her, all leasesand agreements clearly understood before she signed them, and if therewere aught unsatisfactory, both stewards and lawyers were called to herpresence to explain.""Never did I--or any other man--meet with such a head upon a woman\'sshoulders,"" her attorney said.  And the head steward of Dunstanwolde andHelversly learned to quake at the sight of her bold handwriting upon theoutside of a letter.""Such a lady!"" he said--""such a lady!  Lie to her if you can; palter ifyou know how; try upon her the smallest honest shrewd trick, and see howit fares with you.  Were it not that she is generous as she is piercingof eye, no man could serve her and make an honest living.""She went to her chamber and was attired again sumptuously for dinner.Before she descended she dismissed her woman for a space on some errand,and when she was alone, drawing near to her mirror, gazed steadfastlywithin it at her face.  When she had read Osmonde\'s letter her cheeks hadglowed; but when she had come back to earth, and as she had sat under herwoman\'s hands at her toilette, bit by bit the crimson had died out as shehad thought of what was behind her and of what lay before.  The thing wasso stiffly rigid by this time, and its eyes still stared so.  Never hadshe needed to put red upon her cheeks before, Nature having stained themwith such richness of hue; but as no lady of the day was unprovided withher crimson, there was a little pot among her toilette ornaments whichcontained all that any emergency might require.  She opened this smallreceptacle and took from it the red she for the first time was in wantof.""I must not wear a pale face, God knows,"" she said, and rubbed the colouron her cheeks with boldness.It would have seemed that she wore her finest crimson when she went forthfull dressed from her apartment; little Nero grinned to see her, thelacqueys saying among themselves that his Grace\'s courier had surelybrought good news, and that they might expect his master soon.  At thedinner-table \'twas Anne who was pale and ate but little, she having putno red upon her cheeks, and having no appetite for what was spread beforeher.  She looked strangely as though she were withered and shrunken, andher face seemed even wrinkled.  My lady had small leaning towards food,but she sent no food away untouched, forcing herself to eat, and lettingnot the talk flag--though it was indeed true that \'twas she herself whotalked, Mistress Anne speaking rarely; but as it was always her way to besilent, and a listener rather than one who conversed, this was notgreatly noticeable.Her Ladyship of Dunstanwolde talked of her guests of the afternoon, andwas charming and witty in her speech of them; she repeated the _mots_ ofthe wits, and told some brilliant stories of certain modish ladies andgentlemen of fashion; she had things to say of statesmen and politics,and was sparkling indeed in speaking of the lovely languisher whoselittle wrist was too delicate and slender to support the loaded whip.While she talked, Mistress Anne\'s soft, dull eyes were fixed upon herwith a sort of wonder which had some of the quality of bewilderment; butthis was no new thing either, for to the one woman the other was eversomething to marvel at.""It is because you are so quiet a mouse, Anne,"" my lady said, with herdazzling smile, ""that you seem never in the way; and yet I should missyou if I knew you were not within the house.  When the duke takes me toCamylotte you must be with me even then.  It is so great a house that init I can find you a bower in which you can be happy even if you see usbut little.  \'Tis a heavenly place I am told, and of great splendour andbeauty.  The park and flower-gardens are the envy of all England.""""You--will be very happy, sister,"" said Anne, ""and--and like a queen.""""Yes,"" was her sister\'s answer--""yes.""  And \'twas spoken with a deep in-drawn breath.After the repast was ended she went back to the Panelled Parlour.""You may sit with me till bedtime if you desire, Anne,"" she said; ""but\'twill be but dull for you, as I go to sit at work.  I have somedocuments of import to examine and much writing to do.  I shall sit uplate.""  And upon this she turned to the lacquey holding open the door forher passing through.  ""If before half-past ten there comes a message fromSir John Oxon,"" she gave order, ""it must be brought to me at once; butlater I must not be disturbed--it will keep until morning.""Yet as she spoke there was before her as distinct a picture as ever ofwhat lay waiting and gazing in the room to which she went.Until twelve o\'clock she sat at her table, a despatch box by her side,papers outspread before her.  Within three feet of her was the divan, butshe gave no glance to it, sitting writing, reading, and comparingdocuments.  At twelve o\'clock she rose and rang the bell.""I shall be later than I thought,"" she said.  ""I need none of you who arebelow stairs.  Go you all to bed.  Tell my woman that she also may liedown.  I will ring when I come to my chamber and have need of her.  Thereis yet no message from Sir John?""""None, my lady,"" the man answered.He went away with a relieved countenance, as she made no comment.  Heknew that his fellows as well as himself would be pleased enough to bereleased from duty for the night.  They were a pampered lot, and had nofancy for late hours when there were no great entertainments being heldwhich pleased them and gave them chances to receive vails.Mistress Anne sat in a large chair, huddled into a small heap, andlooking colourless and shrunken.  As she heard bolts being shot and barsput up for the closing of the house, she knew that her own dismissal wasat hand.  Doors were shut below stairs, and when all was done the silenceof night reigned as it does in all households when those who work havegone to rest.  \'Twas a common thing enough, and yet this night there wasone woman who felt the stillness so deep that it made her breathing seema sound too loud.""Go to bed, Anne,"" she said.  ""You have stayed up too long.""Anne arose from her chair and drew near to her.""Sister,"" said she, as she had said before, ""let me stay.""She was a poor weak creature, and so she looked with her paleinsignificant face and dull eyes, a wisp of loose hair lying damp on herforehead.  She seemed indeed too weak a thing to stand even for a momentin the way of what must be done this night, and \'twas almost irritatingto be stopped by her.""Nay,"" said my Lady Dunstanwolde, her beautiful brow knitting as shelooked at her.  ""Go to your chamber, Anne, and to sleep.  I must do mywork, and finish to-night what I have begun.""""But--but--"" Anne stammered, dominated again, and made afraid, as sheever was, by this strong nature, ""in this work you must finish--is therenot something I could do to--aid you--even in some small and poor way.  Isthere--naught?""""Naught,"" answered Clorinda, her form drawn to its great full height, herlustrous eyes darkening.  ""What should there be that you couldunderstand?""""Not some small thing--not some poor thing?"" Anne said, her fingersnervously twisting each other, so borne down was she by her awfultimorousness, for awful it was indeed when she saw clouds gather on hersister\'s brow.  ""I have so loved you, sister--I have so loved you that mymind is quickened somehow at times, and I can understand more than wouldbe thought--when I hope to serve you.  Once you said--once you said--""She knew not then nor ever afterwards how it came to pass that in thatmoment she found herself swept into her sister\'s white arms and strainedagainst her breast, wherein she felt the wild heart bounding; nor couldshe, not being given to subtle reasoning, have comprehended the almostfierce kiss on her cheek nor the hot drops that wet it.""I said that I believed that if you saw me commit murder,"" Clorindacried, ""you would love me still, and be my friend and comforter.""""I would, I would!"" cried Anne.""And I believe your word, poor, faithful soul--I do believe it,"" my ladysaid, and kissed her hard again, but the next instant set her free andlaughed.  ""But you will not be put to the test,"" she said, ""for I havedone none.  And in two days\' time my Gerald will be here, and I shall besafe--saved and happy for evermore--for evermore.  There, leave me!  Iwould be alone and end my work.""And she went back to her table and sat beside it, taking her pen towrite, and Anne knew that she dare say no more, and turning, went slowlyfrom the room, seeing for her last sight as she passed through thedoorway, the erect and splendid figure at its task, the light from thecandelabras shining upon the rubies round the snow-white neck andwreathed about the tower of raven hair like lines of crimson.']"
78,20,Chapter 20,"['XIX--A piteous story is told, and the old cellars walled inIt is, indeed, strangely easy in the great world for a man to lose hisimportance, and from having been the target for all eyes and the subjectof all conversation, to step from his place, or find it so taken by somerival that it would seem, judging from the general obliviousness to him,that he had never existed.  But few years before no fashionable gatheringwould have been felt complete had it not been graced by the presence ofthe young and fascinating Lovelace, Sir John Oxon.  Women favoured him,and men made themselves his boon companions; his wit was repeated; thefashion of his hair and the cut of his waistcoat copied.  He was at firstrich and gay enough to be courted and made a favourite; but when hisfortune was squandered, and his marriage with the heiress came to naught,those qualities which were vicious and base in him were more easy to beseen.  Besides, there came new male beauties and new dandies with greaterresources and more of prudence, and these, beginning to set fashion, winladies\' hearts, and make conquests, so drew the attention of the publicmind that he was less noticeable, being only one of many, instead ofruling singly as it had seemed that by some strange chance he did atfirst.  There were indeed so many stories told of his light ways, thattheir novelty being worn off and new ones still repeated, such persons asconcerned themselves with matters of reputation either through conscienceor policy, began to speak of him with less of warmth or leniency.""\'Tis not well for a matron with daughters to marry and with sons to keepan eye to,"" it was said, ""to have in her household too often a younggentleman who has squandered his fortune in dice and drink and wildliving, and who \'twas known was cast off by a reputable young lady offortune.""So there were fine ladies who began to avoid him, and those in power atCourt and in the world who regarded him with lessening favour day by day!In truth, he had such debts, and his creditors pressed him soceaselessly, that even had the world\'s favour continued, his life musthave changed its aspect greatly.  His lodgings were no longer the mostluxurious in the fashionable part of the town, his brocades and laceswere no longer of the richest, nor his habit of the very latest and mostmodish cut; he had no more an equipage attracting every eye as he droveforth, nor a gentleman\'s gentleman whose swagger and pomp outdid that ofall others in his world.  Soon after the breaking of his marriage withthe heiress, his mother had died, and his relatives being few, and thoseof an order strictly averse to the habits of ill-provided and extravagantkinsmen, he had but few family ties.  Other ties he had, \'twas true, butthey were not such as were accounted legal or worthy of attention eitherby himself or those related to him.So it befell that when my Lady Dunstanwolde\'s lacquey could not find himat his lodgings, and as the days went past neither his landlady nor hiscreditors beheld him again, his absence from the scene was not consideredunaccountable by them, nor did it attract the notice it would have donein times gone by.""He hath made his way out of England to escape us,"" said the angrytailors and mercers--who had besieged his door in vain for months, andwho were now infuriated at the thought of their own easiness and theimpudent gay airs which had befooled them.  ""A good four hundred poundsof mine hath he carried with him,"" said one.  ""And two hundred of mine!""""And more of mine, since I am a poor man to whom a pound means twentyguineas!""  ""We are all robbed, and he has cheated the debtors\' prison,wherein, if we had not been fools, he would have been clapped six monthsago.""""Think ye he will not come back, gentlemen?"" quavered his landlady.  ""Godknows when I have seen a guinea of his money--but he was such a handsome,fine young nobleman, and had such a way with a poor body, and ever asmile and a chuck o\' the chin for my Jenny.""""Look well after poor Jenny if he hath left her behind,"" said the tailor.He did not come back, indeed; and hearing the rumour that he had fled hiscreditors, the world of fashion received the news with small disturbance,all modish persons being at that time much engaged in discussion of theapproaching nuptials of her ladyship of Dunstanwolde and the Duke ofOsmonde.  Close upon the discussions of the preparations came thenuptials themselves, and then all the town was agog, and had smallleisure to think of other things.  For those who were bidden to theceremonials and attendant entertainments, there were rich habits andsplendid robes to be prepared; and to those who had not been bidden,there were bitter disappointments and thwarted wishes to think of.""Sir John Oxon has fled England to escape seeing and hearing it all,"" wassaid.""He has fled to escape something more painful than the spleen,"" othersanswered.  ""He had reached his rope\'s end, and finding that my LadyDunstanwolde was not of a mind to lengthen it with her fortune, havingtaken a better man, and that his creditors would have no more patience,he showed them a light pair of heels.""Before my Lady Dunstanwolde left her house she gave orders that it be setin order for closing for some time, having it on her mind that she shouldnot soon return.  It was, however, to be left in such condition that atany moment, should she wish to come to it, all could be made ready in twodays\' time.  To this end various repairs and changes she had planned wereto be carried out as soon as she went away from it.  Among other thingswas the closing with brickwork of the entrance to the passage leading tothe unused cellars.""\'Twill make the servants\' part more wholesome and less damp anddraughty,"" she said; ""and if I should sell the place, will be to itsadvantage.  \'Twas a builder with little wit who planned such passages andblack holes.  In spite of all the lime spread there, they were evermouldy and of evil odour.""It was her command that there should be no time lost, and men were set atwork, carrying bricks and mortar.  It so chanced that one of them, goingin through a back entrance with a hod over his shoulder, and being youngand lively, found his eye caught by the countenance of a pretty,frightened-looking girl, who seemed to be loitering about watching, as ifcurious or anxious.  Seeing her near each time he passed, and observingthat she wished to speak, but was too timid, he addressed her--""Would you know aught, mistress?"" he said.She drew nearer gratefully, and then he saw her eyes were red as if withweeping.""Think you her ladyship would let a poor girl speak a word with her?"" shesaid.  ""Think you I dare ask so much of a servant--or would they flout meand turn me from the door?  Have you seen her?  Does she look like ahard, shrewish lady?""""That she does not, though all stand in awe of her,"" he answered, pleasedto talk with so pretty a creature.  ""I but caught a glimpse of her whenshe gave orders concerning the closing with brick of a passage-way below.She is a tall lady, and grand and stately, but she hath a soft pair ofeyes as ever man would wish to look into, be he duke or ditcher.""The tears began to run down the girl\'s cheeks.""Ay!"" she said; ""all men love her, they say.  Many a poor girl\'ssweetheart has been false through her--and I thought she was cruel andill-natured.  Know you the servants that wait on her?  Would you dare toask one for me, if he thinks she would deign to see a poor girl who wouldcrave the favour to be allowed to speak to her of--of a gentleman sheknows?""""They are but lacqueys, and I would dare to ask what was in my mind,"" heanswered; ""but she is near her wedding-day, and little as I know ofbrides\' ways, I am of the mind that she will not like to be troubled.""""That I stand in fear of,"" she said; ""but, oh! I pray you, ask some oneof them--a kindly one.""The young man looked aside.  ""Luck is with you,"" he said.  ""Here comesone now to air himself in the sun, having naught else to do.  Here is ayoung woman who would speak with her ladyship,"" he said to the strappingpowdered fellow.""She had best begone,"" the lacquey answered, striding towards theapplicant.  ""Think you my lady has time to receive traipsing wenches.""""\'Twas only for a moment I asked,"" the girl said.  ""I come from--I wouldspeak to her of--of Sir John Oxon--whom she knows.""The man\'s face changed.  It was Jenfry.""Sir John Oxon,"" he said.  ""Then I will ask her.  Had you said any othername I would not have gone near her to-day.""Her ladyship was in her new closet with Mistress Anne, and there thelacquey came to her to deliver his errand.""A country-bred young woman, your ladyship,"" he said, ""comes from SirJohn Oxon--""""From Sir John Oxon!"" cried Anne, starting in her chair.My Lady Dunstanwolde made no start, but turned a steady countenancetowards the door, looking into the lacquey\'s face.""Then he hath returned?"" she said.""Returned!"" said Anne.""After the morning he rode home with me,"" my lady answered, ""\'twas saidhe went away.  He left his lodgings without warning.  It seems he hathcome back.  What does the woman want?"" she ended.""To speak with your ladyship,"" replied the man, ""of Sir John himself, shesays.""""Bring her to me,"" her ladyship commanded.The girl was brought in, overawed and trembling.  She was a country-bredyoung creature, as the lacquey had said, being of the simple rose-and-white freshness of seventeen years perhaps, and having childish blue eyesand fair curling locks.She was so frightened by the grandeur of her surroundings, and thesplendid beauty of the lady who was so soon to be a duchess, and wasalready a great earl\'s widow, that she could only stand within thedoorway, curtseying and trembling, with tears welling in her eyes.""Be not afraid,"" said my Lady Dunstanwolde.  ""Come hither, child, andtell me what you want.""  Indeed, she did not look a hard or shrewishlady; she spoke as gently as woman could, and a mildness so unexpectedproduced in the young creature such a revulsion of feeling that she madea few steps forward and fell upon her knees, weeping, and with upliftedhands.""My lady,"" she said, ""I know not how I dared to come, but that I am sodesperate--and your ladyship being so happy, it seemed--it seemed thatyou might pity me, who am so helpless and know not what to do.""Her ladyship leaned forward in her chair, her elbow on her knee, her chinheld in her hand, to gaze at her.""You come from Sir John Oxon?"" she said.Anne, watching, clutched each arm of her chair.""Not _from_ him, asking your ladyship\'s pardon,"" said the child,""but--but--from the country to him,"" her head falling on her breast, ""andI know not where he is.""""You came _to_ him,"" asked my lady.  ""Are you,"" and her speech waspitiful and slow--""are you one of those whom he has--ruined?""The little suppliant looked up with widening orbs.""How could that be, and he so virtuous and pious a gentleman?"" shefaltered.Then did my lady rise with a sudden movement.""Was he so?"" says she.""Had he not been,"" the child answered, ""my mother would have been afraidto trust him.  I am but a poor country widow\'s daughter, but was wellbrought up, and honestly--and when he came to our village my mother wasafraid, because he was a gentleman; but when she saw his piety, and howhe went to church and sang the psalms and prayed for grace, she let melisten to him.""""Did he go to church and sing and pray at first?"" my lady asks.""\'Twas in church he saw me, your ladyship,"" she was answered.  ""He said\'twas his custom to go always when he came to a new place, and that oftenthere he found the most heavenly faces, for \'twas piety and innocencethat made a face like to an angel\'s; and \'twas innocence and virtuestirred his heart to love, and not mere beauty which so fades.""""Go on, innocent thing,"" my lady said; and she turned aside to Anne,flashing from her eyes unseen a great blaze, and speaking in a low andhurried voice.  ""God\'s house,"" she said--""God\'s prayers--God\'s songs ofpraise--he used them all to break a tender heart, and bring an innocentlife to ruin--and yet was he not struck dead?""Anne hid her face and shuddered.""He was a gentleman,"" the poor young thing cried, sobbing--""and I no fitmatch for him, but that he loved me.  \'Tis said love makes all equal; andhe said I was the sweetest, innocent young thing, and without me he couldnot live.  And he told my mother that he was not rich or the fashion now,and had no modish friends or relations to flout any poor beauty he mightchoose to wed.""""And he would marry you?"" my lady\'s voice broke in.  ""He said that hewould marry you?""""A thousand times, your ladyship, and so told my mother, but said I mustcome to town and be married at his lodgings, or \'twould not be counted amarriage by law, he being a town gentleman, and I from the country.""""And you came,"" said Mistress Anne, down whose pale cheeks the tears wererunning--""you came at his command to follow him?""""What day came you up to town?"" demands my lady, breathless and leaningforward.  ""Went you to his lodgings, and stayed you there with him,--evenfor an hour?""The poor child gazed at her, paling.""He was not there!"" she cried.  ""I came alone because he said all must besecret at first; and my heart beat so with joy, my lady, that when thewoman of the house whereat he lodges let me in I scarce could speak.  Butshe was a merry woman and good-natured, and only laughed and cheered mewhen she took me to his rooms, and I sate trembling.""""What said she to you?"" my lady asks, her breast heaving with her breath.""That he was not yet in, but that he would sure come to such a young andpretty thing as I, and I must wait for him, for he would not forgive herif she let me go.  And the while I waited there came a man in bands andcassock, but he had not a holy look, and late in the afternoon I heardhim making jokes with the woman outside, and they both laughed in such anevil way that I was affrighted, and waiting till they had gone to anotherpart of the house, stole away.""""But he came not back that night--thank God!"" my lady said--""he came notback.""The girl rose from her knees, trembling, her hands clasped on her breast.""Why should your ladyship thank God?"" she says, pure drops falling fromher eyes.  ""I am so humble, and had naught else but that great happiness,and it was taken away--and you thank God.""Then drops fell from my lady\'s eyes also, and she came forward and caughtthe child\'s hand, and held it close and warm and strong, and yet with herfull lip quivering.""\'Twas not that your joy was taken away that I thanked God,"" said she.  ""Iam not cruel--God Himself knows that, and when He smites me \'twill not befor cruelty.  I knew not what I said, and yet--tell me what did you then?Tell me?""""I went to a poor house to lodge, having some little money he had givenme,"" the simple young thing answered.  ""\'Twas an honest house, thoughmean and comfortless.  And the next day I went back to his lodgings toquestion, but he had not come, and I would not go in, though the womantried to make me enter, saying, Sir John would surely return soon, as hehad the day before rid with my Lady Dunstanwolde and been to her house;and \'twas plain he had meant to come to his lodgings, for her ladyshiphad sent her lacquey thrice with a message.""The hand with which Mistress Anne sate covering her eyes began to shake.My lady\'s own hand would have shaken had she not been so strong acreature.""And he has not yet returned, then?"" she asked.  ""You have not seen him?""The girl shook her fair locks, weeping with piteous little sobs.""He has not,"" she cried, ""and I know not what to do--and the great townseems full of evil men and wicked women.  I know not which way to turn,for all plot wrong against me, and would drag me down to shamefulness--andback to my poor mother I cannot go.""""Wherefore not, poor child?"" my lady asked her.""I have not been made an honest, wedded woman, and none would believe mystory, and--and he might come back.""""And if he came back?"" said her ladyship.At this question the girl slipped from her grasp and down upon her kneesagain, catching at her rich petticoat and holding it, her eyes searchingthe great lady\'s in imploring piteousness, her own streaming.""I love him,"" she wept--""I love him so--I cannot leave the place where hemight be.  He was so beautiful and grand a gentleman, and, sure, he lovedme better than all else--and I cannot thrust away from me that last nightwhen he held me to his breast near our cottage door, and the nightingalesang in the roses, and he spake such words to me.  I lie and sob allnight on my hard pillow--I so long to see him and to hear his voice--andhearing he had been with you that last morning, I dared to come, prayingthat you might have heard him let drop some word that would tell me wherehe may be, for I cannot go away thinking he may come back longing forme--and I lose him and never see his face again.  Oh! my lady, my lady,this place is so full of wickedness and fierce people--and dark kennelswhere crimes are done.  I am affrighted for him, thinking he may havebeen struck some blow, and murdered, and hid away; and none will look forhim but one who loves him--who loves him.  Could it be so?--could it be?You know the town\'s ways so well.  I pray you, tell me--in God\'s name Ipray you!""""God\'s mercy!"" Anne breathed, and from behind her hands came stifledsobbing.  My Lady Dunstanwolde bent down, her colour dying.""Nay, nay,"" she said, ""there has been no murder done--none!  Hush, poorthing, hush thee.  There is somewhat I must tell thee.""She tried to raise her, but the child would not be raised, and clung toher rich robe, shaking as she knelt gazing upward.""It is a bitter thing,"" my lady said, and \'twas as if her own eyes wereimploring.  ""God help you bear it--God help us all.  He told me nothingof his journey.  I knew not he was about to take it; but wheresoever hehas travelled, \'twas best that he should go.""""Nay! nay!"" the girl cried out--""to leave me helpless.  Nay! it could notbe so.  He loved me--loved me--as the great duke loves you!""""He meant you evil,"" said my lady, shuddering, ""and evil he would havedone you.  He was a villain--a villain who meant to trick you.  Had Godstruck him dead that day, \'twould have been mercy to you.  I knew himwell.""The young thing gave a bitter cry and fell swooning at her feet; and downupon her knees my lady went beside her, loosening her gown, and chafingher poor hands as though they two had been of sister blood.""Call for hartshorn, Anne, and for water,"" she said; ""she will come outof her swooning, poor child, and if she is cared for kindly in time herpain will pass away.  God be thanked she knows no pain that cannot pass!I will protect her--aye, that will I, as I will protect all he hath donewrong to and deserted.""* * * * *She was so strangely kind through the poor victim\'s swoons and weepingthat the very menials who were called to aid her went back to their hallwondering in their talk of the noble grandness of so great a lady, who onthe very brink of her own joy could stoop to protect and comfort acreature so far beneath her, that to most ladies her sorrow and desertionwould have been things which were too trivial to count; for \'twasguessed, and talked over with great freedom and much shrewdness, thatthis was a country victim of Sir John Oxon\'s, and he having deserted hiscreditors, was ready enough to desert his rustic beauty, finding her heavyon his hands.Below stairs the men closing the entrance to the passage with brick,having caught snatches of the servants\' gossip, talked of what they heardamong themselves as they did their work.""Ay, a noble lady indeed,"" they said.  ""For \'tis not a woman\'s way to bekindly with the cast-off fancy of a man, even when she does not want himherself.  He was her own worshipper for many a day, Sir John; and beforeshe took the old earl \'twas said that for a space people believed sheloved him.  She was but fifteen and a high mettled beauty; and he ashandsome as she, and had a blue eye that would melt any woman--but atsixteen he was a town rake, and such tricks as this one he hath playedsince he was a lad.  \'Tis well indeed for this poor thing her ladyshiphath seen her.  She hath promised to protect her, and sends her down toDunstanwolde with her mother this very week.  Would all fine ladies wereof her kind.  To hear such things of her puts a man in the humour to doher work well.""']"
78,21,Chapter 21,"['XX--A noble marriageWhen the duke came back from France, and to pay his first eager visit tohis bride that was to be, her ladyship\'s lacqueys led him not to thePanelled Parlour, but to a room which he had not entered before, it beingone she had had the fancy to have remodelled and made into a beautifulcloset for herself, her great wealth rendering it possible for her toaccomplish changes without the loss of time the owners of limited pursesare subjected to in the carrying out of plans.  This room she had made asunlike the Panelled Parlour as two rooms would be unlike one another.  Itspanellings were white, its furnishings were bright and delicate, itsdraperies flowered with rosebuds tied in clusters with love-knots of pinkand blue; it had a large bow-window, through which the sunlight streamed,and it was blooming with great rose-bowls overrunning with sweetness.From a seat in the morning sunshine among the flowers and plants in thebow-window, there rose a tall figure in a snow-white robe--a figure likethat of a beautiful stately girl who was half an angel.  It was my lady,who came to him with blushing cheeks and radiant shining eyes, and wasswept into his arms in such a passion of love and blessed tenderness asHeaven might have smiled to see.""My love! my love!"" he breathed.  ""My life! my life and soul!""""My Gerald!"" she cried.  ""My Gerald--let me say it on your breast athousand times!""""My wife!"" he said--""so soon my wife and all my own until life\'s end.""""Nay, nay,"" she cried, her cheek pressed to his own, ""through alleternity, for Love\'s life knows no end.""As it had seemed to her poor lord who had died, so it seemed to this manwho lived and so worshipped her--that the wonder of her sweetness was athing to marvel at with passionate reverence.  Being a man of greatermind and poetic imagination than Dunstanwolde, and being himself adoredby her, as that poor gentleman had not had the good fortune to be, he hadten thousand-fold the power and reason to see the tender radiance of her.As she was taller than other women, so her love seemed higher andgreater, and as free from any touch of earthly poverty of feeling as herbeauty was from any flaw.  In it there could be no doubt, no pride; itcould be bounded by no limit, measured by no rule, its depths sounded byno plummet.His very soul was touched by her great longing to give to him thefeeling, and to feel herself, that from the hour that she had become his,her past life was a thing blotted out.""I am a new created thing,"" she said; ""until you called me \'Love\' I hadno life!  All before was darkness.  \'Twas you, my Gerald, who said, \'Letthere be light, and there was light.\'""""Hush, hush, sweet love,"" he said.  ""Your words would make me too nearGod\'s self.""""Sure Love is God,"" she cried, her hands upon his shoulders, her faceuplifted.  ""What else?  Love we know; Love we worship and kneel to; Loveconquers us and gives us Heaven.  Until I knew it, I believed naught.  NowI kneel each night and pray, and pray, but to be pardoned and madeworthy.""Never before, it was true, had she knelt and prayed, but from this timeno nun in her convent knelt oftener or prayed more ardently, and herprayer was ever that the past might be forgiven her, the future blessed,and she taught how to so live that there should be no faintest shadow inthe years to come.""I know not What is above me,"" she said.  ""I cannot lie and say I love Itand believe, but if there is aught, sure It must be a power which isgreat, else had the world not been so strange a thing, and I--and thosewho live in it--and if He made us, He must know He is to blame when Hehas made us weak or evil.  And He must understand why we have been somade, and when we throw ourselves into the dust before Him, and pray forhelp and pardon, surely--surely He will lend an ear!  We know naught, wehave been told naught; we have but an old book which has been handed downthrough strange hands and strange tongues, and may be but poor history.We have so little, and we are threatened so; but for love\'s sake I willpray the poor prayers we are given, and for love\'s sake there is no dusttoo low for me to lie in while I plead.""This was the strange truth--though \'twas not so strange if the worldfeared not to admit such things--that through her Gerald, who was butnoble and high-souled man, she was led to bow before God\'s throne as thehumblest and holiest saint bows, though she had not learned belief andonly had learned love.""But life lasts so short a while,"" she said to Osmonde.  ""It seems soshort when it is spent in such joy as this; and when the day comes--for,oh! Gerald, my soul sees it already--when the day comes that I kneel byyour bedside and see your eyes close, or you kneel by mine, it _must_ bethat the one who waits behind shall know the parting is not all.""""It could not be all, beloved,"" Osmonde said.  ""Love is sure, eternal.""Often in these blissful hours her way was almost like a child\'s, she wasso tender and so clinging.  At times her beauteous, great eyes were fullof an imploring which made them seem soft with tears, and thus they werenow as she looked up at him.""I will do all I can,"" she said.  ""I will obey every law, I will prayoften and give alms, and strive to be dutiful and--holy, that in the endHe will not thrust me from you; that I may stay near--even in the lowestplace, even in the lowest--that I may see your face and know that you seemine.  We are so in His power, He can do aught with us; but I will soobey Him and so pray that He will let me in.""To Anne she went with curious humility, questioning her as to herreligious duties and beliefs, asking her what books she read, and whatservices she attended.""All your life you have been a religious woman,"" she said.  ""I used tothink it folly, but now--""""But now--"" said Anne.""I know not what to think,"" she answered.  ""I would learn.""But when she listened to Anne\'s simple homilies, and read her weightysermons, they but made her restless and unsatisfied.""Nay, \'tis not that,"" she said one day, with a deep sigh.  ""\'Tis morethan that; \'tis deeper, and greater, and your sermons do not hold it.They but set my brain to questioning and rebellion.""But a short time elapsed before the marriage was solemnised, and such awedding the world of fashion had not taken part in for years, \'twas said.Royalty honoured it; the greatest of the land were proud to countthemselves among the guests; the retainers, messengers, and company ofthe two great houses were so numerous that in the west end of the townthe streets wore indeed quite a festal air, with the passing to and froof servants and gentlefolk with favours upon their arms.\'Twas to the Tower of Camylott, the most beautiful and remote of thebridegroom\'s several notable seats, that they removed their household,when the irksomeness of the extended ceremonies and entertainments wereover--for these they were of too distinguished rank to curtail as lesserpersonages might have done.  But when all things were over, the statelytown houses closed, and their equipages rolled out beyond the sight oftown into the country roads, the great duke and his great duchess sathand in hand, gazing into each other\'s eyes with as simple and ardent ajoy as they had been but young \'prentice and country maid, flying to hidefrom the world their love.""There is no other woman who is so like a queen,"" Osmonde said, withtenderest smiling.  ""And yet your eyes wear a look so young in these daysthat they are like a child\'s.  In all their beauty, I have never seenthem so before.""""It is because I am a new created thing, as I have told you, love,"" sheanswered, and leaned towards him.  ""Do you not know I never was a child.I bring myself to you new born.  Make of me then what a woman shouldbe--to be beloved of husband and of God.  Teach me, my Gerald.  I am yourchild and servant.""\'Twas ever thus, that her words when they were such as these were endedupon his breast as she was swept there by his impassioned arm.  She wasso goddess-like and beautiful a being, her life one strangely dominantand brilliant series of triumphs, and yet she came to him with suchsoftness and humility of passion, that scarcely could he think himself awaking man.""Surely,"" he said, ""it is a thing too wondrous and too full of joy\'ssplendour to be true.""In the golden afternoon, when the sun was deepening and mellowing towardsits setting, they and their retinue entered Camylott.  The bells pealedfrom the grey belfry of the old church; the villagers came forth in cleansmocks and Sunday cloaks of scarlet, and stood in the street and by theroadside curtseying and baring their heads with rustic cheers; littlecountry girls with red cheeks threw posies before the horses\' feet, andinto the equipage itself when they were of the bolder sort.  Theirchariot passed beneath archways of flowers and boughs, and from thebattlements of the Tower of Camylott there floated a flag in the softwind.""God save your Graces,"" the simple people cried.  ""God give your Gracesjoy and long life!  Lord, what a beautiful pair they be.  And though herGrace was said to be a proud lady, how sweetly she smiles at a poor body.God love ye, madam!  Madam, God love ye!""Her Grace of Osmonde leaned forward in her equipage and smiled at thepeople with the face of an angel.""I will teach them to love me, Gerald,"" she said.  ""I have not had loveenough.""""Has not all the world loved you?"" he said.""Nay,"" she answered, ""only you, and Dunstanwolde and Anne.""Late at night they walked together on the broad terrace before the Tower.The blue-black vault of heaven above them was studded with myriads ofGod\'s brilliants; below them was spread out the beauty of the land, therolling plains, the soft low hills, the forests and moors folded andhidden in the swathing robe of the night; from the park and gardensfloated upward the freshness of acres of thick sward and deep fernthicket, the fragrance of roses and a thousand flowers, the tendersighing of the wind through the huge oaks and beeches bordering theavenues, and reigning like kings over the seeming boundless grassyspaces.As lovers have walked since the days of Eden they walked together, nolonger duke and duchess, but man and woman--near to Paradise as humanbeings may draw until God breaks the chain binding them to earth; and,indeed, it would seem that such hours are given to the straining humansoul that it may know that somewhere perfect joy must be, since sometimesthe gates are for a moment opened that Heaven\'s light may shine through,so that human eyes may catch glimpses of the white and golden glorieswithin.His arm held her, she leaned against him, their slow steps so harmonisingthe one with the other that they accorded with the harmony of music; thenightingales trilling and bubbling in the rose trees were not affrightedby the low murmur of their voices; perchance, this night they were sonear to Nature that the barriers were o\'erpassed, and they and thesingers were akin.""Oh! to be a woman,"" Clorinda murmured.  ""To be a woman at last.  Allother things I have been, and have been called \'Huntress,\' \'Goddess,\'\'Beauty,\' \'Empress,\' \'Conqueror,\'--but never \'Woman.\'  And had our pathsnot crossed, I think I never could have known what \'twas to be one, forto be a woman one must close with the man who is one\'s mate.  It must notbe that one looks down, or only pities or protects and guides; and onlyto a few a mate seems given.  And I--Gerald, how dare I walk thus at yourside and feel your heart so beat near mine, and know you love me, and soworship you--so worship you--""She turned and threw herself upon his breast, which was so near.""Oh, woman! woman!"" he breathed, straining her close.  ""Oh, woman who ismine, though I am but man.""""We are but one,"" she said; ""one breath, one soul, one thought, and onedesire.  Were it not so, I were not woman and your wife, nor you man andmy soul\'s lover as you are.  If it were not so, we were still apart,though we were wedded a thousand times.  Apart, what are we but likelopped-off limbs; welded together, we are--_this_.""  And for a momentthey spoke not, and a nightingale on the rose vine, clambering o\'er theterrace\'s balustrade, threw up its little head and sang as if to themyriads of golden stars.  They stood and listened, hand in hand, hersweet breast rose and fell, her lovely face was lifted to the bespangledsky.""Of all this,"" she said, ""I am a part, as I am a part of you.  To-night,as the great earth throbs, and as the stars tremble, and as the windsighs, so I, being woman, throb and am tremulous and sigh also.  Theearth lives for the sun, and through strange mysteries blooms forth eachseason with fruits and flowers; love is my sun, and through itssacredness I may bloom too, and be as noble as the earth and that itbears.""']"
78,22,Chapter 22,"['XXI--An heir is bornIn a fair tower whose windows looked out upon spreading woods, and richlovely plains stretching to the freshness of the sea, Mistress Anne hadher abode which her duchess sister had given to her for her own living inas she would.  There she dwelt and prayed and looked on the new lifewhich so beauteously unfolded itself before her day by day, as the leavesof a great tree unfold from buds and become noble branches, housing birdsand their nests, shading the earth and those sheltering beneath them,braving centuries of storms.To this simile her simple mind oft reverted, for indeed it seemed to herthat naught more perfect and more noble in its high likeness to pureNature and the fulfilling of God\'s will than the passing days of thesetwo lives could be.""As the first two lived--Adam and Eve in their garden of Eden--they seemto me,"" she used to say to her own heart; ""but the Tree of Knowledge wasnot forbidden them, and it has taught them naught ignoble.""As she had been wont to watch her sister from behind the ivy of herchamber windows, so she often watched her now, though there was no fearin her hiding, only tenderness, it being a pleasure to her full of wonderand reverence to see this beautiful and stately pair go lovingly and inhigh and gentle converse side by side, up and down the terrace, throughthe paths, among the beds of flowers, under the thick branched trees andover the sward\'s softness.""It is as if I saw Love\'s self, and dwelt with it--the love God\'s naturemade,"" she said, with gentle sighs.For if these two had been great and beauteous before, it seemed in thesedays as if life and love glowed within them, and shone through their merebodies as a radiant light shines through alabaster lamps.  The strengthof each was so the being of the other that no thought could take form inthe brain of one without the other\'s stirring with it.""Neither of us dare be ignoble,"" Osmonde said, ""for \'twould make poor andbase the one who was not so in truth.""""\'Twas not the way of my Lady Dunstanwolde to make a man feel that hestood in church,"" a frivolous court wit once said, ""but in sooth herGrace of Osmonde has a look in her lustrous eyes which accords not withscandalous stories and playhouse jests.""And true it was that when they went to town they carried with them theillumining of the pure fire which burned within their souls, and bore itall unknowing in the midst of the trivial or designing world, which knewnot what it was that glowed about them, making things bright which hadseemed dull, and revealing darkness where there had been brilliant glare.They returned not to the house which had been my Lord of Dunstanwolde\'s,but went to the duke\'s own great mansion, and there lived splendidly andin hospitable state.  Royalty honoured them, and all the wits came there,some of those gentlemen who writ verses and dedications being by no meansaverse to meeting noble lords and ladies, and finding in their loves andgraces material which might be useful.  \'Twas not only Mr. Addison andMr. Steele, Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope, who were made welcome in the statelyrooms, but others who were more humble, not yet having won their spurs,and how these worshipped her Grace for the generous kindness which wasnot the fashion, until she set it, among great ladies, their odes andverses could scarce express.""They are so poor,"" she said to her husband.  ""They are so poor, and yetin their starved souls there is a thing which can less bear flouting thanthe dull content which rules in others.  I know not whether \'tis a curseor a boon to be born so.  \'Tis a bitter thing when the bird that fluttersin them has only little wings.  All the more should those who are strongprotect and comfort them.""She comforted so many creatures.  In strange parts of the town, where noother lady would have dared to go to give alms, it was rumoured that shewent and did noble things privately.  In dark kennels, where thieves hidand vagrants huddled, she carried her beauty and her stateliness, thewhich when they shone on the poor rogues and victims housed there seemedlike the beams of the warm and golden sun.Once in a filthy hovel in a black alley she came upon a poor girl dyingof a loathsome ill, and as she stood by her bed of rags she heard in herdelirium the uttering of one man\'s name again and again, and when shequestioned those about she found that the sufferer had been a littlecountry wench enticed to town by this man for a plaything, and in a fewweeks cast off to give birth to a child in the almshouse, and then godown to the depths of vice in the kennel.""What is the name she says?"" her Grace asked the hag nearest to her, andleast maudlin with liquor.  ""I would be sure I heard it aright.""""\'Tis the name of a gentleman, your ladyship may be sure,"" the beldamanswered; ""\'tis always the name of a gentleman.  And this is one I knowwell, for I have heard more than one poor soul mumbling it and raving athim in her last hours.  One there was, and I knew her, a pretty rosything in her country days, not sixteen, and distraught with love for him,and lay in the street by his door praying him to take her back when hethrew her off, until the watch drove her away.  And she was so mad withlove and grief she killed her girl child when \'twas born i\' the kennel,sobbing and crying that it should not live to be like her and bearothers.  And she was condemned to death, and swung for it on Tyburn Tree.And, Lord! how she cried his name as she jolted on her coffin to thegallows, and when the hangman put the rope round her shuddering littlefair neck.  \'Oh, John,\' screams she, \'John Oxon, God forgive thee!  Nay,\'tis God should be forgiven for letting thee to live and me to die likethis.\'  Aye, \'twas a bitter sight!  She was so little and so young, andso affrighted.  The hangman could scarce hold her.  I was i\' the midst o\'the crowd and cried to her to strive to stand still, \'twould be thesooner over.  But that she could not.  \'Oh, John,\' she screams, \'JohnOxon, God forgive thee!  Nay, \'tis God should be forgiven for lettingthee to live and me to die like this!\'""Till the last hour of the poor creature who lay before her when she heardthis thing, her Grace of Osmonde saw that she was tended, took her fromher filthy hovel, putting her in a decent house and going to her day byday, until she received her last breath, holding her hand while the poorwench lay staring up at her beauteous face and her great deep eyes, whoselustrousness held such power to sustain, protect, and comfort.""Be not afraid, poor soul,"" she said, ""be not afraid.  I will stay nearthee.  Soon all will end in sleep, and if thou wakest, sure there will beChrist who died, and wipes all tears away.  Hear me say it to thee for aprayer,"" and she bent low and said it soft and clear into the deadeningear, ""He wipes all tears away--He wipes all tears away.""The great strength she had used in the old days to conquer and subdue, towin her will and to defend her way, seemed now a power but to protect thesuffering and uphold the weak, and this she did, not alone in hovels butin the brilliant court and world of fashion, for there she foundsuffering and weakness also, all the more bitter and sorrowful since itdared not cry aloud.  The grandeur of her beauty, the elevation of herrank, the splendour of her wealth would have made her a protector ofgreat strength, but that which upheld all those who turned to her wasthat which dwelt within the high soul of her, the courage and power oflove for all things human which bore upon itself, as if upon an eagle\'soutspread wings, the woes dragging themselves broken and halting uponearth.  The starving beggar in the kennel felt it, and, not knowingwherefore, drew a longer, deeper breath, as if of purer, more exaltedair; the poor poet in his garret was fed by it, and having stood near orspoken to her, went back to his lair with lightening eyes and soul warmedto believe that the words his Muse might speak the world might stay tohear.From the hour she stayed the last moments of John Oxon\'s victim she setherself a work to do.  None knew it but herself at first, and later Anne,for \'twas done privately.  From the hag who had told her of the poorgirl\'s hanging upon Tyburn Tree, she learned things by close questioning,which to the old woman\'s dull wit seemed but the curiousness of a greatlady, and from others who stood too deep in awe of her to think of her asa mere human being, she gathered clues which led her far in the tracingof the evils following one wicked, heartless life.  Where she could hearof man, woman, or child on whom John Oxon\'s sins had fallen, or who hadsuffered wrong by him, there she went to help, to give light, to givecomfort and encouragement.  Strangely, as it seemed to them, and as ifdone by the hand of Heaven, the poor tradesmen he had robbed were paidtheir dues, youth he had led into evil ways was checked mysteriously andset in better paths; women he had dragged downward were given aid andchance of peace or happiness; children he had cast upon the world,unfathered, and with no prospect but the education of the gutter, and alife of crime, were cared for by a powerful unseen hand.  The prettycountry girl saved by his death, protected by her Grace, and livinginnocently at Dunstanwolde, memory being merciful to youth, forgot him,gained back her young roses, and learned to smile and hope as though hehad been but a name.""Since \'twas I who killed him,"" said her Grace to her inward soul, ""\'tisI must live his life which I took from him, and making it better I may beforgiven--if there is One who dares to say to the poor thing He made, \'Iwill not forgive.\'""Surely it was said there had never been lives so beautiful and noble asthose the Duke of Osmonde and his lady lived as time went by.  The Towerof Camylott, where they had spent the first months of their wedded life,they loved better than any other of their seats, and there they spent asmuch time as their duties of Court and State allowed them.  It was indeeda splendid and beautiful estate, the stately tower being built upon aneminence, and there rolling out before it the most lovely land inEngland, moorland and hills, thick woods and broad meadows, the edge ofthe heather dipping to show the soft silver of the sea.Here was this beauteous woman chatelaine and queen, wife of her husbandas never before, he thought, had wife blessed and glorified the existenceof mortal man.  All her great beauty she gave to him in tender, joyoustribute; all her great gifts of mind and wit and grace it seemed shevalued but as they were joys to him; in his stately households in townand country she reigned a lovely empress, adored and obeyed withreverence by every man or woman who served her and her lord.  Among thepeople on his various estates she came and went a tender goddess ofbenevolence.  When she appeared amid them in the first months of herwedded life, the humble souls regarded her with awe not unmixed withfear, having heard such wild stories of her youth at her father\'s house,and of her proud state and bitter wit in the great London world when shehad been my Lady Dunstanwolde; but when she came among them all else wasforgotten in their wonder at her graciousness and noble way.""To see her come into a poor body\'s cottage, so tall and grand a lady,and with such a carriage as she hath,"" they said, hobnobbing together intheir talk of her, ""looking as if a crown of gold should sit on her highblack head, and then to hear her gentle speech and see the look in hereyes as if she was but a simple new-married girl, full of her joy, andher heart big with the wish that all other women should be as happy asherself, it is, forsooth, a beauteous sight to see.""""Ay, and no hovel too poor for her, and no man or woman too sinful,"" wassaid again.""Heard ye how she found that poor wench of Haylits lying sobbing amongthe fern in the Tower woods, and stayed and knelt beside her to hear hertrouble?  The poor soul has gone to ruin at fourteen, and her father,finding her out, beat her and thrust her from his door, and her Gracecoming through the wood at sunset--it being her way to walk about formere pleasure as though she had no coach to ride in--the girl says shecame through the golden glow as if she had been one of God\'s angels--andshe kneeled and took the poor wench in her arms--as strong as a man,Betty says, but as soft as a young mother--and she said to her thingssurely no mortal lady ever said before--that she knew naught of a suretyof what God\'s true will might be, or if His laws were those that havebeen made by man concerning marriage by priests saying common words, butthat she surely knew of a man whose name was Christ, and He had taughtlove and helpfulness and pity, and for His sake, He having earned ourtrust in Him, whether He was God or man, because He hung and died inawful torture on the Cross--for His sake all of us must love and help andpity--\'I you, poor Betty,\' were her very words, \'and you me.\'  And thenshe went to the girl\'s father and mother, and so talked to them that shebrought them to weeping, and begging Betty to come home; and also shewent to her sweetheart, Tom Beck, and made so tender a story to him ofthe poor pretty wench whose love for him had brought her to such trouble,that she stirred him up to falling in love again, which is not man\'s wayat such times, and in a week\'s time he and Betty went to church together,her Grace setting them up in a cottage on the estate.""""I used all my wit and all my tenderest words to make a picture thatwould fire and touch him, Gerald,"" her Grace said, sitting at herhusband\'s side, in a great window, from which they often watched thesunset in the valley spread below; ""and that with which I am so strongsometimes--I know not what to call it, but \'tis a power people bend to,that I know--that I used upon him to waken his dull soul and brain.  Whosefault is it that they are dull?  Poor lout, he was born so, as I was bornstrong and passionate, and as you were born noble and pure and high.  Iled his mind back to the past, when he had been made happy by the sightof Betty\'s little smiling, blushing face, and when he had kissed her andmade love in the hayfields.  And this I said--though \'twas not a thing Ihave learned from any chaplain--that when \'twas said he should make anhonest woman of her, it was _my_ thought that she had been honest fromthe first, being too honest to know that the world was not so, and thateven the man a woman loved with all her soul, might be a rogue, and haveno honesty in him.  And at last--\'twas when I talked to him about thechild--and that I put my whole soul\'s strength in--he burst out a-cryinglike a schoolboy, and said indeed she was a fond little thing and hadloved him, and he had loved her, and \'twas a shame he had so done by her,and he had not meant it at the first, but she was so simple, and he hadbeen a villain, but if he married her now, he would be called a fool, andlaughed at for his pains.  Then was I angry, Gerald, and felt my eyesflash, and I stood up tall and spoke fiercely: \'Let them dare,\' Isaid--\'let any man or woman dare, and then will they see what his Gracewill say.\'""Osmonde drew her to his breast, laughing into her lovely eyes.""Nay, \'tis not his Grace who need be called on,"" he said; ""\'tis her Gracethey love and fear, and will obey; though \'tis the sweetest, womanishthing that you should call on me when you are power itself, and can sorule all creatures you come near.""""Nay,"" she said, with softly pleading face, ""let me not rule.  Rule forme, or but help me; I so long to say your name that they may know I speakbut as your wife.""""Who is myself,"" he answered--""my very self.""""Ay,"" she said, with a little nod of her head, ""that I know--that I amyourself; and \'tis because of this that one of us cannot be proud withthe other, for there is no other, there is only one.  And I am wrong tosay, \'Let me not rule,\' for \'tis as if I said, \'You must not rule.\'  Imeant surely, \'God give me strength to be as noble in ruling as our loveshould make me.\'  But just as one tree is a beech and one an oak, just asthe grass stirs when the summer wind blows over it, so a woman is awoman, and \'tis her nature to find her joy in saying such words to theman who loves her, when she loves as I do.  Her heart is so full that shemust joy to say her husband\'s name as that of one she cannot thinkwithout--who is her life as is her blood and her pulses beating.  \'Tis ajoy to say your name, Gerald, as it will be a joy""--and she looked farout across the sun-goldened valley and plains, with a strange, heavenlysweet smile--""as it will be a joy to say our child\'s--and put his littlemouth to my full breast.""""Sweet love,"" he cried, drawing her by the hand that he might meet theradiance of her look--""heart\'s dearest!""She did not withhold her lovely eyes from him, but withdrew them from thesunset\'s mist of gold, and the clouds piled as it were at the gates ofheaven, and they seemed to bring back some of the far-off glory withthem.  Indeed, neither her smile nor she seemed at that moment to bethings of earth.  She held out her fair, noble arms, and he sprang toher, and so they stood, side beating against side.""Yes, love,"" she said--""yes, love--and I have prayed, my Gerald, that Imay give you sons who shall be men like you.  But when I give you womenchildren, I shall pray with all my soul for them--that they may be justand strong and noble, and life begin for them as it began not for me.""* * * * *In the morning of a spring day when the cuckoos cried in the woods, andMay blossomed thick, white and pink, in all the hedges, the bells in thegrey church-steeple at Camylott rang out a joyous, jangling peal, tellingall the village that the heir had been born at the Tower.  Childrenstopped in their play to listen, men at their work in field and barn;good gossips ran out of their cottage door, wiping their arms dry, fromtheir tubs and scrubbing-buckets, their honest red faces broadening intomaternal grins.""Ay, \'tis well over, that means surely,"" one said to the other; ""and ahappy day has begun for the poor lady--though God knows she bore herselfqueenly to the very last, as if she could have carried her burden foranother year, and blenched not a bit as other women do.  Bless mother andchild, say I.""""And \'tis an heir,"" said another.  ""She promised us that we should knowalmost as quick as she did, and commanded old Rowe to ring a peal, andthen strike one bell loud between if \'twere a boy, and two if \'twere agirl child.  \'Tis a boy, heard you, and \'twas like her wit to invent sucha way to tell us.""In four other villages the chimes rang just as loud and merrily, and thewomen talked, and blessed her Grace and her young child, and casks of alewere broached, and oxen roasted, and work stopped, and dancers footed itupon the green.""Surely the new-born thing comes here to happiness,"" \'twas saideverywhere, ""for never yet was woman loved as is his mother.""In her stately bed her Grace the duchess lay, with the face of the MotherMary, and her man-child drinking from her breast.  The duke walked softlyup and down, so full of joy that he could not sit still.  When he hadentered first, it was his wife\'s self who had sate upright in her bed,and herself laid his son within his arms.""None other shall lay him there,"" she said, ""I have given him to you.  Heis a great child, but he has not taken from me my strength.""He was indeed a great child, even at his first hour, of limbs andcountenance so noble that nurses and physicians regarded him amazed.  Hewas the offspring of a great love, of noble bodies and great souls.  Didsuch powers alone create human beings, the earth would be peopled with arace of giants.Amid the veiled spring sunshine and the flower-scented silence, brokenonly by the twittering of birds nesting in the ivy, her Grace lay softasleep, her son resting on her arm, when Anne stole to look at her andher child.  Through the night she had knelt praying in her chamber, andnow she knelt again.  She kissed the new-born thing\'s curled rose-leafhand and the lace frill of his mother\'s night-rail.  She dared notfurther disturb them.""Sure God forgives,"" she breathed--""for Christ\'s sake.  He would not givethis little tender thing a punishment to bear.""']"
78,23,Chapter 23,"['XXII--Mother AnneThere was no punishment.  The tender little creature grew as a blossomgrows from bud to fairest bloom.  His mother flowered as he, and spenther days in noble cherishing of him and tender care.  Such motherhood andwifehood as were hers were as fair statues raised to Nature\'s self.""Once I thought that I was under ban,"" she said to her lord in one oftheir sweetest hours; ""but I have been given love and a life, and so Iknow it cannot be.  Do I fill all your being, Gerald?""""All, all!"" he cried, ""my sweet, sweet woman.""""Leave I no longing unfulfilled, no duty undone, to you, dear love, tothe world, to human suffering I might aid?  I pray Christ with allpassionate humbleness that I may not.""""He grants your prayer,"" he answered, his eyes moist with worshippingtenderness.""And this white soul given to me from the outer bounds we know not--ithas no stain; and the little human body it wakened to life in--think youthat Christ will help me to fold them in love high and pure enough, andteach the human body to do honour to its soul?  \'Tis not monkish scorn ofitself that I would teach the body; it is so beautiful and noble a thing,and so full of the power of joy.  Surely That which made it--in His ownimage--would not that it should despise itself and its own wonders, butdo them reverence, and rejoice in them nobly, knowing all their seasonsand their changes, counting not youth folly, and manhood sinful, or ageaught but gentle ripeness passing onward?  I pray for a great soul, andgreat wit, and greater power to help this fair human thing to grow, andlove, and live.""These had been born and had rested hid within her when she lay a babestruggling \'neath her dead mother\'s corpse.  Through the darkness ofuntaught years they had grown but slowly, being so unfitly and unfairlynourished; but Life\'s sun but falling on her, they seemed to strive tofair fruition with her days.\'Twas not mere love she gave her offspring--for she bore others as yearspassed, until she was the mother of four sons and two girls, children ofstrength and beauty as noted as her own; she gave them of her constantthought, and an honour of their humanity such as taught them reverence ofthemselves as of all other human things.  Their love for her was such apassion as their father bore her.  She was the noblest creature that theyknew; her beauty, her great unswerving love, her truth, were thingsbearing to their child eyes the unchangingness of God\'s stars in heaven.""Why is she not the Queen?"" a younger one asked his father once, havingbeen to London and seen the Court.  ""The Queen is not so beautiful andgrand as she, and she could so well reign over the people.  She is alwaysjust and honourable, and fears nothing.""From her side Mistress Anne was rarely parted.  In her fair retreat atCamylott she had lived a life all undisturbed by outward things.  Whenthe children were born strange joy came to her.""Be his mother also,"" the duchess had said when she had drawn the clothesaside to show her first-born sleeping in her arm.  ""You were made to bethe mother of things, Anne.""""Nay, or they had been given to me,"" Anne had answered.""Mine I will share with you,"" her Grace had said, lifting her Madonnaface.  ""Kiss me, sister--kiss him, too, and bless him.  Your life hasbeen so innocent it must be good that you should love and guard him.""\'Twas sweet to see the wit she showed in giving to poor Anne the feelingthat she shared her motherhood.  She shared her tenderest cares andduties with her.  Together they bathed and clad the child in the morning,this being their high festival, in which the nurses shared but in theperformance of small duties.  Each day they played with him and laughedas women will at such dear times, kissing his grand round limbs, cryingout at their growth, worshipping his little rosy feet, and smothering himwith caresses.  And then they put him to sleep, Anne sitting close whilehis mother fed him from her breast until his small red mouth parted andslowly released her.When he could toddle about and was beginning to say words, there was amorning when she bore him to Anne\'s tower that they might joy in himtogether, as was their way.  It was a beautiful thing to see her walkcarrying him in the strong and lovely curve of her arm as if his sturdybabyhood were of no more weight than a rose, and he cuddling against her,clinging and crowing, his wide brown eyes shining with delight.""He has come to pay thee court, Anne,"" she said.  ""He is a great gallant,and knows how we are his loving slaves.  He comes to say his new wordthat I have taught him.""She set him down where he stood holding to Anne\'s knee and showing hisnew pearl teeth, in a rosy grin; his mother knelt beside him, beginningher coaxing.""Who is she?"" she said, pointing with her finger at Anne\'s face, her ownfull of lovely fear lest the child should not speak rightly his lesson.""What is her name?  Mammy\'s man say--"" and she mumbled softly with hercrimson mouth at his ear.The child looked up at Anne, with baby wit and laughter in his face, andstammered sweetly--""Muz--Muzzer--Anne,"" he said, and then being pleased with his cleverness,danced on his little feet and said it over and over.Clorinda caught him up and set him on Anne\'s lap.""Know you what he calls you?"" she said.  ""\'Tis but a mumble, his littletongue is not nimble enough for clearness, but he says it his prettybest.  \'Tis Mother Anne, he says--\'tis Mother Anne.""And then they were in each other\'s arms, the child between them, hekissing both and clasping both, with little laughs of joy as if they werebut one creature.Each child born they clasped and kissed so, and were so clasped andkissed by; each one calling the tender unwed woman ""Mother Anne,"" andhaving a special lovingness for her, she being the creature each oneseemed to hover about with innocent protection and companionship.The wonder of Anne\'s life grew deeper to her hour by hour, and where shehad before loved, she learned to worship, for \'twas indeed worship thather soul was filled with.  She could not look back and believe that shehad not dreamed a dream of all the fears gone by and that they held.This--this was true--the beauty of these days, the love of them, thegenerous deeds, the sweet courtesies, and gentle words spoken.  Thisbeauteous woman dwelling in her husband\'s heart, giving him all joy oflife and love, ruling queenly and gracious in his house, bearing himnoble children, and tending them with the very genius of tenderness andwisdom.But in Mistress Anne herself life had never been strong; she was of thefibre of her mother, who had died in youth, crushed by its cruel weight,and to her, living had been so great and terrible a thing.  There had notbeen given to her the will to battle with the Fate that fell to her, thebrain to reason and disentangle problems, or the power to set them aside.So while her Grace of Osmonde seemed but to gain greater state and beautyin her ripening, her sister\'s frail body grew more frail, and seemed toshrink and age.  Yet her face put on a strange worn sweetness, and hersoft, dull eyes had a look almost like a saint\'s who looks at heaven.  Sheprayed much, and did many charitable works both in town and country.  Sheread her books of devotion, and went much to church, sitting with areverend face through many a dull and lengthy sermon she would have feltit sacrilegious to think of with aught but pious admiration.  In themiddle of the night it was her custom to rise and offer up prayersthrough the dark hours.  She was an humble soul who greatly feared andtrembled before her God.""I waken in the night sometimes,"" the fair, tall child Daphne said onceto her mother, ""and Mother Anne is there--she kneels and prays beside mybed.  She kneels and prays so by each one of us many a night.""""\'Tis because she is so pious a woman and so loves us,"" said young John,in his stately, generous way.  The house of Osmonde had never had so fineand handsome a creature for its heir.  He o\'ertopped every boy of his agein height, and the bearing of his lovely youthful body was masculinegrace itself.The town and the Court knew these children, and talked of their beautyand growth as they had talked of their mother\'s.""To be the mate of such a woman, the father of such heirs, is a fate aman might pray God for,"" \'twas said.  ""Love has not grown stale withthem.  Their children are the very blossoms of it.  Her eyes are deeperpools of love each year.""']"
78,24,Chapter 24,"['XXIII--""In One who will do justice, and demands that it shall bedone to each thing He has made, by each who bears His image""\'Twas in these days Sir Jeoffry came to his end, it being in such way ashad been often prophesied; and when this final hour came, there was butone who could give him comfort, and this was the daughter whose youth hehad led with such careless evilness to harm.If he had wondered at her when she had been my Lady Dunstanwolde, as herGrace of Osmonde he regarded her with heavy awe.  Never had she been ableto lead him to visit her at her house in town or at any other which washer home.  ""\'Tis all too grand for me, your Grace,"" he would say; ""I am acountry yokel, and have hunted and drank, and lived too hard to look wellamong town gentlemen.  I must be drunk at dinner, and when I am in liquorI am no ornament to a duchess\'s drawing-room.  But what a woman you havegrown,"" he would say, staring at her and shaking his head.  ""Each time Iclap eyes on you \'tis to marvel at you, remembering what a baggage youwere, and how you kept from slipping by the way.  There was Jack Oxon,now,"" he added one day--""after you married Dunstanwolde, I heard a prettytale of Jack--that he had made a wager among his friends in town--he wasa braggart devil, Jack--that he would have you, though you were soscornful; and knowing him to be a liar, his fellows said that unless hecould bring back a raven lock six feet long to show them, he had lost hisbet, for they would believe no other proof.  And finely they scoffed athim when he came back saying that he had had one, but had hid it away forsafety when he was drunk, and could not find it again.  They so floutedand jeered at him that swords were drawn, and blood as well.  But thoughhe was a beauty and a crafty rake-hell fellow, you were too sharp forhim.  Had you not had so shrewd a wit and strong a will, you would nothave been the greatest duchess in England, Clo, as well as the finestwoman.""""Nay,"" she answered--""in those days--nay, let us not speak of them!  Iwould blot them out--out.""As time went by, and the years spent in drink and debauchery began totell even on the big, strong body which should have served any other manbravely long past his threescore and ten, Sir Jeoffry drank harder andlived more wildly, sometimes being driven desperate by dulness, hiscoarse pleasures having lost their potency.""Liquor is not as strong as it once was,"" he used to grumble, ""and thereare fewer things to stir a man to frolic.  Lord, what roaring days andnights a man could have thirty years ago.""So in his efforts to emulate such nights and days, he plunged deeper anddeeper into new orgies; and one night, after a heavy day\'s hunting,sitting at the head of his table with his old companions, he suddenlyleaned forward, staring with starting eyes at an empty chair in a darkcorner.  His face grew purple, and he gasped and gurgled.""What is\'t, Jeoff?"" old Eldershawe cried, touching his shoulder with ashaking hand.  ""What\'s the man staring at, as if he had gone mad?""""Jack,"" cried Sir Jeoffry, his eyes still farther starting from theirsockets.  ""Jack! what say you?  I cannot hear.""The next instant he sprang up, shrieking, and thrusting with his hands asif warding something off.""Keep back!"" he yelled.  ""There is green mould on thee.  Where hast thoubeen to grow mouldy?  Keep back!  Where hast thou been?""His friends at table started up, staring at him and losing colour; heshrieked so loud and strangely, he clutched his hair with his hands, andfell into his chair, raving, clutching, and staring, or dashing his headdown upon the table to hide his face, and then raising it as if he couldnot resist being drawn in his affright to gaze again.  There was nosoothing him.  He shouted, and struggled with those who would have heldhim.  \'Twas Jack Oxon who was there, he swore--Jack, who kept stealingslowly nearer to him, his face and his fine clothes damp and green, hebeat at the air with mad hands, and at last fell upon the floor, androlled, foaming at the mouth.They contrived, after great strugglings, to bear him to his chamber, butit took the united strength of all who would stay near him to keep himfrom making an end of himself.  By the dawn of day his boon companionsstood by him with their garments torn to tatters, their faces drenchedwith sweat, and their own eyes almost starting from their sockets; thedoctor who had been sent for, coming in no hurry, but scowled and shookhis head when he beheld him.""He is a dead man,"" he said, ""and the wonder is that this has not comebefore.  He is sodden with drink and rotten with ill-living, besidesbeing past all the strength of youth.  He dies of the life he has lived.""\'Twas little to be expected that his boon companions could desert theirhomes and pleasures and tend his horrors longer than a night.  Such asight as he presented did not inspire them to cheerful spirits.""Lord,"" said Sir Chris Crowell, ""to see him clutch his flesh and shriekand mouth, is enough to make a man live sober for his remaining days,""and he shook his big shoulders with a shudder.""Ugh!"" he said, ""God grant I may make a better end.  He writhes as inhell-fire.""""There is but one on earth who will do aught for him,"" said Eldershawe.""\'Tis handsome Clo, who is a duchess; but she will come and tend him, Icould swear.  Even when she was a lawless devil of a child she had a wayof standing by her friends and fearing naught.""So after taking counsel together they sent for her, and in as many hoursas it took to drive from London, her coach stood before the door.  Bythis time all the household was panic-stricken and in hopeless disorder,the women-servants scattered and shuddering in far corners of the house;such men as could get out of the way having found work to do afield or inthe kennels, for none had nerve to stay where they could hear themadman\'s shrieks and howls.Her Grace, entering the house, went with her woman straight to herchamber, and shortly emerged therefrom, stripped of her rich apparel, andclad in a gown of strong blue linen, her hair wound close, her whitehands bare of any ornament, save the band of gold which was her wedding-ring.  A serving-woman might have been clad so; but the plainness of hergarb but made her height, and strength, so reveal themselves, that themere sight of her woke somewhat that was like to awe in the eyes of theservants who beheld her as she passed.She needed not to be led, but straightway followed the awful sounds,until she reached the chamber behind whose door they were shut.  Upon thehuge disordered bed, Sir Jeoffry writhed, and tried to tear himself, hisgreat sinewy and hairy body almost stark.  Two of the stable men werestriving to hold him.The duchess went to his bedside and stood there, laying her strong whitehand upon his shuddering shoulder.""Father,"" she said, in a voice so clear, and with such a ring of steadycommand, as, the men said later, might have reached a dead man\'s ear.""Father, \'tis Clo!""Sir Jeoffry writhed his head round and glared at her, with starting eyesand foaming mouth.""Who says \'tis Clo?"" he shouted.  ""\'Tis a lie!  She was ever a biggerdevil than any other, though she was but a handsome wench.  Jack himselfcould not manage her.  She beat him, and would beat him now.  \'Tis alie!""All through that day and night the power of her Grace\'s white arm was thething which saved him from dashing out his brains.  The two men could nothave held him, and at his greatest frenzy they observed that now and thenhis bloodshot eye would glance aside at the beauteous face above him.  Thesound of the word ""Clo"" had struck upon his brain and wakened an echo.She sent away the men to rest, calling for others in their places; butleave the bedside herself she would not.  \'Twas a strange thing to seeher strength and bravery, which could not be beaten down.  When thedoctor came again he found her there, and changed his surly and reluctantmanner in the presence of a duchess, and one who in her close linen gownwore such a mien.""You should not have left him,"" she said to him unbendingly, ""even thoughI myself can see there is little help that can be given.  Thought you hisGrace and I would brook that he should die alone if we could not havereached him?""Those words ""his Grace and I"" put a new face upon the matter, and all wasdone that lay within the man\'s skill; but most was he disturbedconcerning the lady, who would not be sent to rest, and whose nobleconsort would be justly angered if she were allowed to injure her superbhealth.""His Grace knew what I came to do and how I should do it,"" the duchesssaid, unbending still.  ""But for affairs of State which held him, hewould have been here at my side.""She held her place throughout the second night, and that was worse thanthe first--the paroxysms growing more and more awful; for Jack was withina yard, and stretched out a green and mouldy hand, the finger-bonesshowing through the flesh, the while he smiled awfully.At last one pealing scream rang out after another, until after making hisshuddering body into an arc resting on heels and head, the madman fellexhausted, his flesh all quaking before the eye.  Then the duchess wavedthe men who helped, away.  She sat upon the bed\'s edge close--close toher father\'s body, putting her two firm hands on either of his shoulders,holding him so, and bent down, looking into his wild face, as if shefixed upon his very soul all the power of her wondrous will.""Father,"" she said, ""look at my face.  Thou canst if thou wilt.  Look atmy face.  Then wilt thou see \'tis Clo--and she will stand by thee.""She kept her gaze upon his very pupils; and though \'twas at first as ifhis eyes strove to break away from her look, their effort was controlledby her steadfastness, and they wandered back at last, and her great orbsheld them.  He heaved a long breath, half a big, broken sob, and laystill, staring up at her.""Ay,"" he said, ""\'tis Clo! \'tis Clo!""The sweat began to roll from his forehead, and the tears down his cheeks.He broke forth, wailing like a child.""Clo--Clo,"" he said, ""I am in hell.""She put her hand on his breast, keeping will and eyes set on him.""Nay,"" she answered; ""thou art on earth, and in thine own bed, and I amhere, and will not leave thee.""She made another sign to the men who stood and stared aghast in wonder ather, but feeling in the very air about her the spell to which the madnesshad given way.""\'Twas not mere human woman who sat there,"" they said afterwards in thestables among their fellows.  ""\'Twas somewhat more.  Had such a will beenin an evil thing a man\'s hair would have risen on his skull at the seeingof it.""""Go now,"" she said to them, ""and send women to set the place in order.""She had seen delirium and death enough in the doings of her deeds ofmercy, to know that his strength had gone and death was coming.  His bedand room were made orderly, and at last he lay in clean linen, with allmade straight.  Soon his eyes seemed to sink into his head and stare fromhollows, and his skin grew grey, but ever he stared only at hisdaughter\'s face.""Clo,"" he said at last, ""stay by me!  Clo, go not away!""""I shall not go,"" she answered.She drew a seat close to his bed and took his hand.  It lay knotted andgnarled and swollen-veined upon her smooth palm, and with her other handshe stroked it.  His breath came weak and quick, and fear grew in hiseyes.""What is it, Clo?"" he said.  ""What is\'t?""""\'Tis weakness,"" replied she, soothing him.  ""Soon you will sleep.""""Ay,"" he said, with a breath like a sob.  ""\'Tis over.""His big body seemed to collapse, he shrank so in the bed-clothes.""What day o\' the year is it?"" he asked.""The tenth of August,"" was her answer.""Sixty-nine years from this day was I born,"" he said, ""and now \'tisdone.""""Nay,"" said she--""nay--God grant--""""Ay,"" he said, ""done.  Would there were nine and sixty more.  What a manI was at twenty.  I want not to die, Clo.  I want to live--to live--live,and be young,"" gulping, ""with strong muscle and moist flesh.  Sixty-nineyears--and they are gone!""He clung to her hand, and stared at her with awful eyes.  Through all hislife he had been but a great, strong, human carcass; and he was now butthe same carcass worn out, and at death\'s door.  Of not one human thingbut of himself had he ever thought, not one creature but himself had heever loved--and now he lay at the end, harking back only to the wickedyears gone by.""None can bring them back,"" he shuddered.  ""Not even thou, Clo, who artso strong.  None--none!  Canst pray, Clo?"" with the gasp of a craven.""Not as chaplains do,"" she answered.  ""I believe not in a God whoclamours but for praise.""""What dost believe in, then?""""In One who will do justice, and demands that it shall be done to eachthing He has made, by each who bears His image--ay, and mercy too--butjustice always, for justice is mercy\'s highest self.""Who knows the mysteries of the human soul--who knows the workings of thehuman brain?  The God who is just alone.  In this man\'s mind, which wasso near a simple beast\'s in all its movings, some remote, unbornconsciousness was surely reached and vaguely set astir by the clear wordsthus spoken.""Clo, Clo!"" he cried, ""Clo, Clo!"" in terror, clutching her the closer,""what dost thou mean?  In all my nine and sixty years--"" and rolled hishead in agony.In all his nine and sixty years he had shown justice to no man, mercy tono woman, since he had thought of none but Jeoffry Wildairs; and thistruth somehow dimly reached his long-dulled brain and wakened there.""Down on thy knees, Clo!"" he gasped--""down on thy knees!""It was so horrible, the look struggling in his dying face, that she wentdown upon her knees that moment, and so knelt, folding his shaking handswithin her own against her breast.""Thou who didst make him as he was born into Thy world,"" she said, ""dealwith that to which Thou didst give life--and death.  Show him in thishour, which Thou mad\'st also, that Thou art not Man who would havevengeance, but that justice which is God.""""Then--then,"" he gasped--""then will He damn me!""""He will weigh thee,"" she said; ""and that which His own hand created willHe separate from that which was thine own wilful wrong--and this, sure,He will teach thee how to expiate.""""Clo,"" he cried again--""thy mother--she was but a girl, and died alone--Idid no justice to her!--Daphne!  Daphne!""  And he shook beneath the bed-clothes, shuddering to his feet, his face growing more grey and pinched.""She loved thee once,"" Clorinda said.  ""She was a gentle soul, and wouldnot forget.  She will show thee mercy.""""Birth she went through,"" he muttered, ""and death--alone.  Birth anddeath!  Daphne, my girl--""  And his voice trailed off to nothingness, andhe lay staring at space, and panting.The duchess sat by him and held his hand.  She moved not, though at lasthe seemed to fall asleep.  Two hours later he began to stir.  He turnedhis head slowly upon his pillows until his gaze rested upon her, as shesat fronting him.  \'Twas as though he had awakened to look at her.""Clo!"" he cried, and though his voice was but a whisper, there was bothwonder and wild question in it--""Clo!""But she moved not, her great eyes meeting his with steady gaze; and evenas they so looked at each other his body stretched itself, his lidsfell--and he was a dead man.']"
78,25,Chapter 25,"['XXIV--The doves sate upon the window-ledge and lowly cooed andcooedWhen they had had ten years of happiness, Anne died.  \'Twas of no violentillness, it seemed but that through these years of joy she had beengradually losing life.  She had grown thinner and whiter, and her softeyes bigger and more prayerful.  \'Twas in the summer, and they were atCamylott, when one sweet day she came from the flower-garden with herhands full of roses, and sitting down by her sister in her morning-room,swooned away, scattering her blossoms on her lap and at her feet.When she came back to consciousness she looked up at the duchess with astrange, far look, as if her soul had wandered back from some greatdistance.""Let me be borne to bed, sister,"" she said.  ""I would lie still.  I shallnot get up again.""The look in her face was so unearthly and a thing so full of mystery,that her Grace\'s heart stood still, for in some strange way she knew theend had come.They bore her to her tower and laid her in her bed, when she looked onceround the room and then at her sister.""\'Tis a fair, peaceful room,"" she said.  ""And the prayers I have prayedin it have been answered.  To-day I saw my mother, and she told me so.""""Anne!  Anne!"" cried her Grace, leaning over her and gazing fearfullyinto her face; for though her words sounded like delirium, her look hadno wildness in it.  And yet--""Anne, Anne! you wander, love,"" the duchesscried.Anne smiled a strange, sweet smile.  ""Perchance I do,"" she said.  ""I knownot truly, but I am very happy.  She said that all was over, and that Ihad not done wrong.  She had a fair, young face, with eyes that seemed tohave looked always at the stars of heaven.  She said I had done nowrong.""The duchess\'s face laid itself down upon the pillow, a river of cleartears running down her cheeks.""Wrong!"" she said--""you! dear one--woman of Christ\'s heart, if ever livedone.  You were so weak and I so strong, and yet as I look back it seemsthat all of good that made me worthy to be wife and mother I learned fromyour simplicity.""Through the tower window and the ivy closing round it, the blueness ofthe summer sky was heavenly fair; soft, and light white clouds floatedacross the clearness of its sapphire.  On this Anne\'s eyes were fixedwith an uplifted tenderness until she broke her silence.""Soon I shall be away,"" she said.  ""Soon all will be left behind.  And Iwould tell you that my prayers were answered--and so, sure, yours willbe.""No man could tell what made the duchess then fall on her knees, but sheherself knew.  \'Twas that she saw in the exalted dying face that turnedto hers concealing nothing more.""Anne! Anne!"" she cried.  ""Sister Anne!  Mother Anne of my children!  Youhave known--you have known all the years and kept it hid!""She dropped her queenly head and shielded the whiteness of her face inthe coverlid\'s folds.""Ay, sister,"" Anne said, coming a little back to earth, ""and from thefirst.  I found a letter near the sun-dial--I guessed--I loved you--andcould do naught else but guard you.  Many a day have I watched within therose-garden--many a day--and night--God pardon me--and night.  When Iknew a letter was hid, \'twas my wont to linger near, knowing that mypresence would keep others away.  And when you approached--or he--Islipped aside and waited beyond the rose hedge--that if I heard a step, Imight make some sound of warning.  Sister, I was your sentinel, and beingso, knelt while on my guard, and prayed.""""My sentinel!"" Clorinda cried.  ""And knowing all, you so guarded me nightand day, and prayed God\'s pity on my poor madness and girl\'s frenzy!""  Andshe gazed at her in amaze, and with humblest, burning tears.""For my own poor self as well as for you, sister, did I pray God\'s pityas I knelt,"" said Anne.  ""For long I knew it not--being so ignorant--butalas!  I loved him too!--I loved him too!  I have loved no man other allmy days.  He was unworthy any woman\'s love--and I was too lowly for himto cast a glance on; but I was a woman, and God made us so.""Clorinda clutched her pallid hand.""Dear God,"" she cried, ""you loved him!""Anne moved upon her pillow, drawing weakly, slowly near until her whitelips were close upon her sister\'s ear.""The night,"" she panted--""the night you bore him--in your arms--""Then did the other woman give a shuddering start and lift her head,staring with a frozen face.""What! what!"" she cried.""Down the dark stairway,"" the panting voice went on, ""to the far cellar--Ikept watch again.""""You kept watch--you?"" the duchess gasped.""Upon the stair which led to the servants\' place--that I might stop themif--if aught disturbed them, and they oped their doors--that I might sendthem back, telling them--it was I.""Then stooped the duchess nearer to her, her hands clutching the coverlid,her eyes widening.""Anne, Anne,"" she cried, ""you knew the awful thing that I would hide!That too?  You knew that he was _there_!""Anne lay upon her pillow, her own eyes gazing out through the ivy-hungwindow of her tower at the blue sky and the fair, fleecy clouds.  A flockof snow-white doves were flying back and forth across it, and one sateupon the window\'s deep ledge and cooed.  All was warm and perfumed withsummer\'s sweetness.  There seemed naught between her and the upliftingblueness, and naught of the earth was near but the dove\'s deep-throatedcooing and the laughter of her Grace\'s children floating upward from thegarden of flowers below.""I lie upon the brink,"" she said--""upon the brink, sister, and methinksmy soul is too near to God\'s pure justice to fear as human things fear,and judge as earth does.  She said I did no wrong.  Yes, I knew.""""And knowing,"" her sister cried, ""you came to me _that afternoon_!""""To stand by that which lay hidden, that I might keep the rest away.Being a poor creature and timorous and weak--""""Weak! weak!"" the duchess cried, amid a greater flood of streamingtears--""ay, I have dared to call you so, who have the heart of a greatlioness.  Oh, sweet Anne--weak!""""\'Twas love,"" Anne whispered.  ""Your love was strong, and so was mine.That other love was not for me.  I knew that my long woman\'s life wouldpass without it--for woman\'s life is long, alas! if love comes not.  Butyou were love\'s self, and I worshipped you and it; and to myself Isaid--praying forgiveness on my knees--that one woman should know love ifI did not.  And being so poor and imperfect a thing, what mattered if Igave my soul for you--and love, which is so great, and rules the world.Look at the doves, sister, look at them, flying past the heavenlyblueness--and she said I did no wrong.""Her hand was wet with tears fallen upon it, as her duchess sister knelt,and held and kissed it, sobbing.""You knew, poor love, you knew!"" she cried.""Ay, all of it I knew,"" Anne said--""his torture of you and the madness ofyour horror.  And when he forced himself within the Panelled Parlour thatday of fate, I knew he came to strike some deadly blow; and in suchanguish I waited in my chamber for the end, that when it came not, Icrept down, praying that somehow I might come between--and I went in theroom!""""And there--what saw you?"" quoth the duchess, shuddering.  ""Somewhat youmust have seen, or you could not have known.""""Ay,"" said Anne, ""and heard!"" and her chest heaved.""Heard!"" cried Clorinda.  ""Great God of mercy!""""The room was empty, and I stood alone.  It was so still I was afraid; itseemed so like the silence of the grave; and then there came a sound--along and shuddering breath--but one--and then--""The memory brought itself too keenly back, and she fell a-shivering.""I heard a slipping sound, and a dead hand fell on the floor-lyingoutstretched, its palm turned upwards, showing beneath the valance of thecouch.""She threw her frail arms round her sister\'s neck, and as Clorinda claspedher own, breathing gaspingly, they swayed together.""What did you then?"" the duchess cried, in a wild whisper.""I prayed God keep me sane--and knelt--and looked below.  I thrust itback--the dead hand, saying aloud, \'Swoon you must not, swoon you mustnot, swoon you shall not--God help!  God help!\'--and I saw!--the purplemark--his eyes upturned--his fair curls spread; and I lost strength andfell upon my side, and for a minute lay there--knowing that shudder ofbreath had been the very last expelling of his being, and his hand hadfallen by its own weight.""""O God!  O God!  O God!"" Clorinda cried, and over and over said the word,and over again.""How was\'t--how was\'t?"" Anne shuddered, clinging to her.  ""How was\'t\'twas done?  I have so suffered, being weak--I have so prayed!  God willhave mercy--but it has done me to death, this knowledge, and before Idie, I pray you tell me, that I may speak truly at God\'s throne.""""O God!  O God!  O God!"" Clorinda groaned--""O God!"" and having cried so,looking up, was blanched as a thing struck with death, her eyes like agreat stag\'s that stands at bay.""Stay, stay!"" she cried, with a sudden shock of horror, for a new thoughthad come to her which, strangely, she had not had before.  ""You thought I_murdered_ him?""Convulsive sobs heaved Anne\'s poor chest, tears sweeping her hollowcheeks, her thin, soft hands clinging piteously to her sister\'s.""Through all these years I have known nothing,"" she wept--""sister, I haveknown nothing but that I found him hidden there, a dead man, whom you sohated and so feared.""Her hands resting upon the bed\'s edge, Clorinda held her body upright,such passion of wonder, love, and pitying adoring awe in her large eyesas was a thing like to worship.""You thought I _murdered_ him, and loved me still,"" she said.  ""Youthought I murdered him, and still you shielded me, and gave me chance tolive, and to repent, and know love\'s highest sweetness.  You thought Imurdered him, and yet your soul had mercy.  Now do I believe in God, foronly a God could make a heart so noble.""""And you--did not--"" cried out Anne, and raised upon her elbow, herbreast panting, but her eyes growing wide with light as from stars fromheaven.  ""Oh, sister love--thanks be to Christ who died!""The duchess rose, and stood up tall and great, her arms out-thrown.""I think \'twas God Himself who did it,"" she said, ""though \'twas I whostruck the blow.  He drove me mad and blind, he tortured me, and thrustto my heart\'s core.  He taunted me with that vile thing Nature will notlet women bear, and did it in my Gerald\'s name, calling on him.  And thenI struck with my whip, knowing nothing, not seeing, only striking, like agoaded dying thing.  He fell--he fell and lay there--and all was done!""""But not with murderous thought--only through frenzy and a cruel chance--acruel, cruel chance.  And of your own will blood is not upon your hand,""Anne panted, and sank back upon her pillow.""With deepest oaths I swear,"" Clorinda said, and she spoke through herclenched teeth, ""if I had not loved, if Gerald had not been my soul\'slife and I his, I would have stood upright and laughed in his face at thedevil\'s threats.  Should I have feared?  You know me.  Was there a thingon earth or in heaven or hell I feared until love rent me.  \'Twould buthave fired my blood, and made me mad with fury that dares all.  \'Spreadit abroad!\' I would have cried to him.  \'Tell it to all the world, cravenand outcast, whose vileness all men know, and see how I shall bearmyself, and how I shall drive through the town with head erect.  As Ibore myself when I set the rose crown on my head, so shall I bear myselfthen.  And you shall see what comes!\'  This would I have said, and heldto it, and gloried.  But I knew love, and there was an anguish that Icould not endure--that my Gerald should look at me with changed eyes,feeling that somewhat of his rightful meed was gone.  And I was alldistraught and conquered.  Of ending his base life I never thought, neverat my wildest, though I had thought to end my own; but when Fate struckthe blow for me, then I swore that carrion should not taint my whole lifethrough.  It should not--should not--for \'twas Fate\'s self had doomed meto my ruin.  And there it lay until the night; for this I planned, thatbeing of such great strength for a woman, I could bear his body in myarms to the farthest of that labyrinth of cellars I had commanded to becut off from the rest and closed; and so I did when all were sleeping--butyou, poor Anne--but you!  And there I laid him, and there he liesto-day--an evil thing turned to a handful of dust.""""It was not murder,"" whispered Anne--""no, it was not.""  She lifted to hersister\'s gaze a quivering lip.  ""And yet once I had loved him--years Ihad loved him,"" she said, whispering still.  ""And in a woman there isever somewhat that the mother creature feels""--the hand which held hersister\'s shook as with an ague, and her poor lip quivered--""Sister, I--sawhim again!""The duchess drew closer as she gasped, ""Again!""""I could not rest,"" the poor voice said.  ""He had been so base, he was sobeautiful, and so unworthy love--and he was dead,--none knowing,untouched by any hand that even pitied him that he was so base a thing,for that indeed is piteous when death comes and none can be repentant.And he lay so hard, so hard upon the stones.""Her teeth were chattering, and with a breath drawn like a wild sob ofterror, the duchess threw her arm about her and drew her nearer.""Sweet Anne,"" she shuddered--""sweet Anne--come back--you wander!""""Nay, \'tis not wandering,"" Anne said.  ""\'Tis true, sister.  There is nonight these years gone by I have not remembered it again--and seen.  Inthe night after that you bore him there--I prayed until the mid-hours,when all were sleeping fast--and then I stole down--in my bare feet, thatnone could hear me--and at last I found my way in the black dark--feelingthe walls until I reached that farthest door in the stone--and then Ilighted my taper and oped it.""""Anne!"" cried the duchess--""Anne, look through the tower window at theblueness of the sky--at the blueness, Anne!""  But drops of cold water hadstarted out and stood upon her brow.""He lay there in his grave--it was a little black place with its stonewalls--his fair locks were tumbled,"" Anne went on, whispering.  ""The spotwas black upon his brow--and methought he had stopped mocking, and surelylooked upon some great and awful thing which asked of him a question.  Iknelt, and laid his curls straight, and his hands, and tried to shut hiseyes, but close they would not, but stared at that which questioned.  Andhaving loved him so, I kissed his poor cheek as his mother might havedone, that he might not stand outside, having carried not one tenderhuman thought with him.  And, oh, I prayed, sister--I prayed for his poorsoul with all my own.  \'If there is one noble or gentle thing he has everdone through all his life,\' I prayed, \'Jesus remember it--Christ do notforget.\'  We who are human do so few things that are noble--oh, surelyone must count.""The duchess\'s head lay near her sister\'s breast, and she had fallen a-sobbing--a-sobbing and weeping like a young broken child.""Oh, brave and noble, pitiful, strong, fair soul!"" she cried.  ""As Christloved you have loved, and He would hear your praying.  Since you sopleaded, He would find one thing to hang His mercy on.""She lifted her fair, tear-streaming face, clasping her hands as onepraying.""And I--and I,"" she cried--""have I not built a temple on his grave?  HaveI not tried to live a fair life, and be as Christ bade me?  Have I notloved, and pitied, and succoured those in pain?  Have I not filled agreat man\'s days with bliss, and love, and wifely worship?  Have I notgiven him noble children, bred in high lovingness, and taught to love allthings God made, even the very beasts that perish, since they, too,suffer as all do?  Have I left aught undone?  Oh, sister, I have soprayed that I left naught.  Even though I could not believe that therewas One who, ruling all, could yet be pitiless as He is to some, I haveprayed That--which sure it seems must be, though we comprehend it not--toteach me faith in something greater than my poor self, and not of earth.Say this to Christ\'s self when you are face to face--say this to Him, Ipray you!  Anne, Anne, look not so strangely through the window at theblueness of the sky, sweet soul, but look at me.""For Anne lay upon her pillow so smiling that \'twas a strange thing tobehold.  It seemed as she were smiling at the whiteness of the dovesagainst the blue.  A moment her sister stood up watching her, and thenshe stirred, meaning to go to call one of the servants waiting outside;but though she moved not her gaze from the tower window, Mistress Annefaintly spoke.""Nay--stay,"" she breathed.  ""I go--softly--stay.""Clorinda fell upon her knees again and bent her lips close to her ear.This was death, and yet she feared it not--this was the passing of asoul, and while it went it seemed so fair and loving a thing that shecould ask it her last question--her greatest--knowing it was so near toGod that its answer must be rest.""Anne, Anne,"" she whispered, ""must he know--my Gerald?  Must I--must Itell him all?  If so I must, I will--upon my knees.""The doves came flying downward from the blue, and lighted on the windowstone and cooed--Anne\'s answer was as low as her soft breath and herstill eyes were filled with joy at that she saw but which another couldnot.""Nay,"" she breathed.  ""Tell him not.  What need?  Wait, and let God tellhim--who understands.""Then did her soft breath stop, and she lay still, her eyes yet open andsmiling at the blossoms, and the doves who sate upon the window-ledge andlowly cooed and cooed.* * * * *\'Twas her duchess sister who clad her for her last sleeping, and made herchamber fair--the hand of no other touched her; and while \'twas done thetower chamber was full of the golden sunshine, and the doves ceased notto flutter about the window, and coo as if they spoke lovingly to eachother of what lay within the room.Then the children came to look, their arms full of blossoms and floweringsprays.  They had been told only fair things of death, and knowing butthese fair things, thought of it but as the opening of a golden door.They entered softly, as entering the chamber of a queen, and movingtenderly, with low and gentle speech, spread all their flowers about thebed--laying them round her head, on her breast, and in her hands, andstrewing them thick everywhere.""She lies in a bower and smiles at us,"" one said.  ""She hath grownbeautiful like you, mother, and her face seems like a white star in themorning.""""She loves us as she ever did,"" the fair child Daphne said; ""she willnever cease to love us, and will be our angel.  Now have we an angel ofour own.""When the duke returned, who had been absent since the day before, theduchess led him to the tower chamber, and they stood together hand inhand and gazed at her peace.""Gerald,"" the duchess said, in her tender voice, ""she smiles, does notshe?""""Yes,"" was Osmonde\'s answer--""yes, love, as if at God, who has smiled atherself--faithful, tender woman heart!""The hand which he held in his clasp clung closer.  The other crept to hisshoulder and lay there tremblingly.""How faithful and how tender, my Gerald,"" Clorinda said, ""I only know.She is my saint--sweet Anne, whom I dared treat so lightly in my poorwayward days.  Gerald, she knows all my sins, and to-day she has carriedthem in her pure hands to God and asked His mercy on them.  She had noneof her own.""""And so having done, dear heart, she lies amid her flowers, and smiles,""he said, and he drew her white hand to press it against his breast.* * * * *While her body slept beneath soft turf and flowers, and that which washer self was given in God\'s heaven, all joys for which her earthly beinghad yearned, even when unknowing how to name its longing, each year thatpassed made more complete and splendid the lives of those she so hadloved.  Never, \'twas said, had woman done such deeds of gentleness andshown so sweet and generous a wisdom as the great duchess.  None who wereweak were in danger if she used her strength to aid them; no man or womanwas a lost thing whom she tried to save: such tasks she set herself as nolady had ever given herself before; but \'twas not her way to fail--herwill being so powerful, her brain so clear, her heart so purely noble.Pauper and prince, noble and hind honoured her and her lord alike, andall felt wonder at their happiness.  It seemed that they had learnedlife\'s meaning and the honouring of love, and this they taught to theirchildren, to the enriching of a long and noble line.  In the ripeness ofyears they passed from earth in as beauteous peace as the sun sets, andupon a tablet above the resting-place of their ancestors there areinscribed lines like these:--   ""Here sleeps by her husband the purest and noblest lady God e\'er   loved, yet the high and gentle deeds of her chaste sweet life sleep   not, but live and grow, and so will do so long as earth is earth.""

79,2,Chapter 2,"['IOn a cold morning in December, towards the close of the year 1612, ayoung man, whose clothing betrayed his poverty, was standing before thedoor of a house in the Rue des Grands-Augustine, in Paris. After walkingto and fro for some time with the hesitation of a lover who fearsto approach his mistress, however complying she may be, he ended bycrossing the threshold and asking if Maitre Francois Porbus were within.At the affirmative answer of an old woman who was sweeping out one ofthe lower rooms the young man slowly mounted the stairway, stopping fromtime to time and hesitating, like a newly fledged courier doubtful as towhat sort of reception the king might grant him.When he reached the upper landing of the spiral ascent, he paused amoment before laying hold of a grotesque knocker which ornamented thedoor of the atelier where the famous painter of Henry IV.--neglected byMarie de Medicis for Rubens--was probably at work. The young man feltthe strong sensation which vibrates in the soul of great artists when,in the flush of youth and of their ardor for art, they approach a man ofgenius or a masterpiece. In all human sentiments there are, as it were,primeval flowers bred of noble enthusiasms, which droop and fade fromyear to year, till joy is but a memory and glory a lie. Amid suchfleeting emotions nothing so resembles love as the young passion of anartist who tastes the first delicious anguish of his destined fame andwoe,--a passion daring yet timid, full of vague confidence and surediscouragement. Is there a man, slender in fortune, rich in hisspring-time of genius, whose heart has not beaten loudly as heapproached a master of his art? If there be, that man will forever lacksome heart-string, some touch, I know not what, of his brush, somefibre in his creations, some sentiment in his poetry. When braggarts,self-satisfied and in love with themselves, step early into the famewhich belongs rightly to their future achievements, they are menof genius only in the eyes of fools. If talent is to be measured byyouthful shyness, by that indefinable modesty which men born to glorylose in the practice of their art, as a pretty woman loses hers amongthe artifices of coquetry, then this unknown young man might claim tobe possessed of genuine merit. The habit of success lessens doubt; andmodesty, perhaps, is doubt.Worn down with poverty and discouragement, and dismayed at this momentby his own presumption, the young neophyte might not have dared to enterthe presence of the master to whom we owe our admirable portrait ofHenry IV., if chance had not thrown an unexpected assistance in his way.An old man mounted the spiral stairway. The oddity of his dress, themagnificence of his lace ruffles, the solid assurance of his deliberatestep, led the youth to assume that this remarkable personage must be thepatron, or at least the intimate friend, of the painter. He drew backinto a corner of the landing and made room for the new-comer; looking athim attentively and hoping to find either the frank good-nature ofthe artistic temperament, or the serviceable disposition of thosewho promote the arts. But on the contrary he fancied he saw somethingdiabolical in the expression of the old man\'s face,--something, I knownot what, which has the quality of alluring the artistic mind.Imagine a bald head, the brow full and prominent and falling with deepprojection over a little flattened nose turned up at the end like thenoses of Rabelais and Socrates; a laughing, wrinkled mouth; a shortchin boldly chiselled and garnished with a gray beard cut into a point;sea-green eyes, faded perhaps by age, but whose pupils, contrastingwith the pearl-white balls on which they floated, cast at timesmagnetic glances of anger or enthusiasm. The face in other respectswas singularly withered and worn by the weariness of old age, and stillmore, it would seem, by the action of thoughts which had undermined bothsoul and body. The eyes had lost their lashes, and the eyebrows werescarcely traced along the projecting arches where they belonged. Imaginesuch a head upon a lean and feeble body, surround it with lace ofdazzling whiteness worked in meshes like a fish-slice, festoon the blackvelvet doublet of the old man with a heavy gold chain, and you willhave a faint idea of the exterior of this strange individual, to whoseappearance the dusky light of the landing lent fantastic coloring. Youmight have thought that a canvas of Rembrandt without its frame hadwalked silently up the stairway, bringing with it the dark atmospherewhich was the sign-manual of the great master. The old man cast a lookupon the youth which was full of sagacity; then he rapped three timesupon the door, and said, when it was opened by a man in feeble health,apparently about forty years of age, ""Good-morning, maitre.""Porbus bowed respectfully, and made way for his guest, allowing theyouth to pass in at the same time, under the impression that he camewith the old man, and taking no further notice of him; all the lessperhaps because the neophyte stood still beneath the spell which holds aheaven-born painter as he sees for the first time an atelier filled withthe materials and instruments of his art. Daylight came from a casementin the roof and fell, focussed as it were, upon a canvas which rested onan easel in the middle of the room, and which bore, as yet, only threeor four chalk lines. The light thus concentrated did not reach the darkangles of the vast atelier; but a few wandering reflections gleamedthrough the russet shadows on the silvered breastplate of a horseman\'scuirass of the fourteenth century as it hung from the wall, or sentsharp lines of light upon the carved and polished cornice of a dresserwhich held specimens of rare pottery and porcelains, or touched withsparkling points the rough-grained texture of ancient gold-brocadedcurtains, flung in broad folds about the room to serve the painteras models for his drapery. Anatomical casts in plaster, fragmentsand torsos of antique goddesses amorously polished by the kisses ofcenturies, jostled each other upon shelves and brackets. Innumerablesketches, studies in the three crayons, in ink, and in red chalkcovered the walls from floor to ceiling; color-boxes, bottles of oil andturpentine, easels and stools upset or standing at right angles, leftbut a narrow pathway to the circle of light thrown from the window inthe roof, which fell full on the pale face of Porbus and on the ivoryskull of his singular visitor.The attention of the young man was taken exclusively by a picturedestined to become famous after those days of tumult and revolution,and which even then was precious in the sight of certain opinionatedindividuals to whom we owe the preservation of the divine afflatusthrough the dark days when the life of art was in jeopardy. This noblepicture represents the Mary of Egypt as she prepares to pay for herpassage by the ship. It is a masterpiece, painted for Marie de Medicis,and afterwards sold by her in the days of her distress.""I like your saint,"" said the old man to Porbus, ""and I will give youten golden crowns over and above the queen\'s offer; but as to enteringinto competition with her--the devil!""""You do like her, then?""""As for that,"" said the old man, ""yes, and no. The good woman is wellset-up, but--she is not living. You young men think you have done allwhen you have drawn the form correctly, and put everything inplace according to the laws of anatomy. You color the features withflesh-tones, mixed beforehand on your palette,--taking very good care toshade one side of the face darker than the other; and because you drawnow and then from a nude woman standing on a table, you think you cancopy nature; you fancy yourselves painters, and imagine that you havegot at the secret of God\'s creations! Pr-r-r-r!--To be a great poet itis not enough to know the rules of syntax and write faultless grammar.Look at your saint, Porbus. At first sight she is admirable; but at thevery next glance we perceive that she is glued to the canvas, and thatwe cannot walk round her. She is a silhouette with only one side,a semblance cut in outline, an image that can\'t turn nor change herposition. I feel no air between this arm and the background of thepicture; space and depth are wanting. All is in good perspective; theatmospheric gradations are carefully observed, and yet in spite of yourconscientious labor I cannot believe that this beautiful body has thewarm breath of life. If I put my hand on that firm, round throat I shallfind it cold as marble. No, no, my friend, blood does not run beneaththat ivory skin; the purple tide of life does not swell those veins, norstir those fibres which interlace like net-work below the translucentamber of the brow and breast. This part palpitates with life, but thatother part is not living; life and death jostle each other in everydetail. Here, you have a woman; there, a statue; here again, a deadbody. Your creation is incomplete. You have breathed only a part of yoursoul into the well-beloved work. The torch of Prometheus went out inyour hands over and over again; there are several parts of your paintingon which the celestial flame never shone.""""But why is it so, my dear master?"" said Porbus humbly, while the youngman could hardly restrain a strong desire to strike the critic.""Ah! that is the question,"" said the little old man. ""You are floatingbetween two systems,--between drawing and color, between the patientphlegm and honest stiffness of the old Dutch masters and the dazzlingwarmth and abounding joy of the Italians. You have tried to follow, atone and the same time, Hans Holbein and Titian; Albrecht Durier andPaul Veronese. Well, well! it was a glorious ambition, but what isthe result? You have neither the stern attraction of severity nor thedeceptive magic of the chiaroscuro. See! at this place the rich, clearcolor of Titian has forced out the skeleton outline of Albrecht Durier,as molten bronze might burst and overflow a slender mould. Here andthere the outline has resisted the flood, and holds back the magnificenttorrent of Venetian color. Your figure is neither perfectly wellpainted nor perfectly well drawn; it bears throughout the signs of thisunfortunate indecision. If you did not feel that the fire of your geniuswas hot enough to weld into one the rival methods, you ought to havechosen honestly the one or the other, and thus attained the unity whichconveys one aspect, at least, of life. As it is, you are true onlyon your middle plane. Your outlines are false; they do not round uponthemselves; they suggest nothing behind them. There is truth here,"" saidthe old man, pointing to the bosom of the saint; ""and here,"" showing thespot where the shoulder ended against the background; ""but there,"" headded, returning to the throat, ""it is all false. Do not inquire intothe why and wherefore. I should fill you with despair.""The old man sat down on a stool and held his head in his hands for someminutes in silence.""Master,"" said Porbus at length, ""I studied that throat from the nude;but, to our sorrow, there are effects in nature which become false orimpossible when placed on canvas.""""The mission of art is not to copy nature, but to represent it. Youare not an abject copyist, but a poet,"" cried the old man, hastilyinterrupting Porbus with a despotic gesture. ""If it were not so, asculptor could reach the height of his art by merely moulding awoman. Try to mould the hand of your mistress, and see what you willget,--ghastly articulations, without the slightest resemblance to herliving hand; you must have recourse to the chisel of a man who, withoutservilely copying that hand, can give it movement and life. It is ourmission to seize the mind, soul, countenance of things and beings.Effects! effects! what are they? the mere accidents of the life, and notthe life itself. A hand,--since I have taken that as an example,--ahand is not merely a part of the body, it is far more; it expresses andcarries on a thought which we must seize and render. Neither the painternor the poet nor the sculptor should separate the effect from the cause,for they are indissolubly one. The true struggle of art lies there. Manya painter has triumphed through instinct without knowing this theory ofart as a theory.""Yes,"" continued the old man vehemently, ""you draw a woman, but you donot _see_ her. That is not the way to force an entrance into the arcanaof Nature. Your hand reproduces, without an action of your mind, themodel you copied under a master. You do not search out the secretsof form, nor follow its windings and evolutions with enough love andperseverance. Beauty is solemn and severe, and cannot be attained inthat way; we must wait and watch its times and seasons, and clasp itfirmly ere it yields to us. Form is a Proteus less easily captured, moreskilful to double and escape, than the Proteus of fable; it is onlyat the cost of struggle that we compel it to come forth in its trueaspects. You young men are content with the first glimpse you get of it;or, at any rate, with the second or the third. This is not the spiritof the great warriors of art,--invincible powers, not misled bywill-o\'-the-wisps, but advancing always until they force Nature to liebare in her divine integrity. That was Raphael\'s method,"" said the oldman, lifting his velvet cap in homage to the sovereign of art; ""hissuperiority came from the inward essence which seems to break from theinner to the outer of his figures. Form with him was what it is withus,--a medium by which to communicate ideas, sensations, feelings; inshort, the infinite poesy of being. Every figure is a world; a portrait,whose original stands forth like a sublime vision, colored with therainbow tints of light, drawn by the monitions of an inward voice, laidbare by a divine finger which points to the past of its whole existenceas the source of its given expression. You clothe your women withdelicate skins and glorious draperies of hair, but where is the bloodwhich begets the passion or the peace of their souls, and is the causeof what you call \'effects\'? Your saint is a dark woman; but this, mypoor Porbus, belongs to a fair one. Your figures are pale, coloredphantoms, which you present to our eyes; and you call that painting!art! Because you make something which looks more like a woman than ahouse, you think you have touched the goal; proud of not being obligedto write ""currus venustus"" or ""pulcher homo"" on the frame of yourpicture, you think yourselves majestic artists like our greatforefathers. Ha, ha! you have not got there yet, my little men; youwill use up many a crayon and spoil many a canvas before you reach thatheight. Undoubtedly a woman carries her head this way and her petticoatsthat way; her eyes soften and droop with just that look of resignedgentleness; the throbbing shadow of the eyelashes falls exactly thusupon her cheek. That is it, and--that is _not it_. What lacks? A merenothing; but that mere nothing is _all_. You have given the shadow oflife, but you have not given its fulness, its being, its--I know notwhat--soul, perhaps, which floats vaporously about the tabernacle offlesh; in short, that flower of life which Raphael and Titian culled.Start from the point you have now attained, and perhaps you may yetpaint a worthy picture; you grew weary too soon. Mediocrity will extolyour work; but the true artist smiles. O Mabuse! O my master!"" addedthis singular person, ""you were a thief; you have robbed us of yourlife, your knowledge, your art! But at least,"" he resumed after a pause,""this picture is better than the paintings of that rascally Rubens, withhis mountains of Flemish flesh daubed with vermilion, his cascades ofred hair, and his hurly-burly of color. At any rate, you have got theelements of color, drawing, and sentiment,--the three essential parts ofart.""""But the saint is sublime, good sir!"" cried the young man in a loudvoice, waking from a deep reverie. ""These figures, the saint and theboatman, have a subtile meaning which the Italian painters cannot give.I do not know one of them who could have invented that hesitation of theboatman.""""Does the young fellow belong to you?"" asked Porbus of the old man.""Alas, maitre, forgive my boldness,"" said the neophyte, blushing. ""I amall unknown; only a dauber by instinct. I have just come to Paris, thatfountain of art and science.""""Let us see what you can do,"" said Porbus, giving him a red crayon and apiece of paper.The unknown copied the saint with an easy turn of his hand.""Oh! oh!"" exclaimed the old man, ""what is your name?""The youth signed the drawing: Nicolas Poussin.""Not bad for a beginner,"" said the strange being who had discoursed sowildly. ""I see that it is worth while to talk art before you. I don\'tblame you for admiring Porbus\'s saint. It is a masterpiece for the worldat large; only those who are behind the veil of the holy of holies canperceive its errors. But you are worthy of a lesson, and capable ofunderstanding it. I will show you how little is needed to turn thatpicture into a true masterpiece. Give all your eyes and all yourattention; such a chance of instruction may never fall in your wayagain. Your palette, Porbus.""Porbus fetched his palette and brushes. The little old man turned uphis cuffs with convulsive haste, slipped his thumb through the palettecharged with prismatic colors, and snatched, rather than took, thehandful of brushes which Porbus held out to him. As he did so his beard,cut to a point, seemed to quiver with the eagerness of an incontinentfancy; and while he filled his brush he muttered between his teeth:--""Colors fit to fling out of the window with the man who groundthem,--crude, false, revolting! who can paint with them?""Then he dipped the point of his brush with feverish haste into thevarious tints, running through the whole scale with more rapiditythan the organist of a cathedral runs up the gamut of the ""O Filii"" atEaster.Porbus and Poussin stood motionless on either side of the easel, plungedin passionate contemplation.""See, young man,"" said the old man without turning round, ""see how withthree or four touches and a faint bluish glaze you can make the aircirculate round the head of the poor saint, who was suffocating in thatthick atmosphere. Look how the drapery now floats, and you see that thebreeze lifts it; just now it looked like heavy linen held out by pins.Observe that the satiny lustre I am putting on the bosom gives it theplump suppleness of the flesh of a young girl. See how this tone ofmingled reddish-brown and ochre warms up the cold grayness of that largeshadow where the blood seemed to stagnate rather than flow. Young man,young man! what I am showing you now no other master in the world canteach you. Mabuse alone knew the secret of giving life to form. Mabusehad but one pupil, and I am he. I never took a pupil, and I am an oldman now. You are intelligent enough to guess at what should follow fromthe little that I shall show you to-day.""While he was speaking, the extraordinary old man was giving touches hereand there to all parts of the picture. Here two strokes of the brush,there one, but each so telling that together they brought out a newpainting,--a painting steeped, as it were, in light. He worked withsuch passionate ardor that the sweat rolled in great drops from his baldbrow; and his motions seemed to be jerked out of him with such rapidityand impatience that the young Poussin fancied a demon, encased with thebody of this singular being, was working his hands fantastically likethose of a puppet without, or even against, the will of their owner. Theunnatural brightness of his eyes, the convulsive movements which seemedthe result of some mental resistance, gave to this fancy of the youtha semblance of truth which reacted upon his lively imagination. The oldman worked on, muttering half to himself, half to his neophyte:--""Paf! paf! paf! that is how we butter it on, young man. Ah! my littlepats, you are right; warm up that icy tone. Come, come!--pon, pon,pon,--"" he continued, touching up the spots where he had complained of alack of life, hiding under layers of color the conflicting methods, andregaining the unity of tone essential to an ardent Egyptian.""Now see, my little friend, it is only the last touches of the brushthat count for anything. Porbus put on a hundred; I have only put on oneor two. Nobody will thank us for what is underneath, remember that!""At last the demon paused; the old man turned to Porbus and Poussin, whostood mute with admiration, and said to them,--""It is not yet equal to my Beautiful Nut-girl; still, one can put one\'sname to such a work. Yes, I will sign it,"" he added, rising to fetcha mirror in which to look at what he had done. ""Now let us go andbreakfast. Come, both of you, to my house. I have some smoked ham andgood wine. Hey! hey! in spite of the degenerate times we will talkpainting; we are strong ourselves. Here is a little man,"" he continued,striking Nicolas Poussin on the shoulder, ""who has the faculty.""Observing the shabby cap of the youth, he pulled from his belt aleathern purse from which he took two gold pieces and offered them tohim, saying,--""I buy your drawing.""""Take them,"" said Porbus to Poussin, seeing that the latter trembledand blushed with shame, for the young scholar had the pride of poverty;""take them, he has the ransom of two kings in his pouch.""The three left the atelier and proceeded, talking all the way of art,to a handsome wooden house standing near the Pont Saint-Michel, whosewindow-casings and arabesque decoration amazed Poussin. The embryopainter soon found himself in one of the rooms on the ground floorseated, beside a good fire, at a table covered with appetizing dishes,and, by unexpected good fortune, in company with two great artists whotreated him with kindly attention.""Young man,"" said Porbus, observing that he was speechless, with hiseyes fixed on a picture, ""do not look at that too long, or you will fallinto despair.""It was the Adam of Mabuse, painted by that wayward genius to enable himto get out of the prison where his creditors had kept him so long. Thefigure presented such fulness and force of reality that Nicolas Poussinbegan to comprehend the meaning of the bewildering talk of the old man.The latter looked at the picture with a satisfied but not enthusiasticmanner, which seemed to say, ""I have done better myself.""""There is life in the form,"" he remarked. ""My poor master surpassedhimself there; but observe the want of truth in the background. Theman is living, certainly; he rises and is coming towards us; but theatmosphere, the sky, the air that we breathe, see, feel,--where arethey? Besides, that is only a man; and the being who came first fromthe hand of God must needs have had something divine about him whichis lacking here. Mabuse said so himself with vexation in his sobermoments.""Poussin looked alternately at the old man and at Porbus with uneasycuriosity. He turned to the latter as if to ask the name of their host,but the painter laid a finger on his lips with an air of mystery, andthe young man, keenly interested, kept silence, hoping that sooner orlater some word of the conversation might enable him to guess the nameof the old man, whose wealth and genius were sufficiently attested bythe respect which Porbus showed him, and by the marvels of art heapedtogether in the picturesque apartment.Poussin, observing against the dark panelling of the wall a magnificentportrait of a woman, exclaimed aloud, ""What a magnificent Giorgione!""""No,"" remarked the old man, ""that is only one of my early daubs.""""Zounds!"" cried Poussin naively; ""are you the king of painters?""The old man smiled, as if long accustomed to such homage. ""MaitreFrenhofer,"" said Porbus, ""could you order up a little of your good Rhinewine for me?""""Two casks,"" answered the host; ""one to pay for the pleasure oflooking at your pretty sinner this morning, and the other as a mark offriendship.""""Ah! if I were not so feeble,"" resumed Porbus, ""and if you would consentto let me see your Beautiful Nut-girl, I too could paint some loftypicture, grand and yet profound, where the forms should have the livinglife.""""Show my work!"" exclaimed the old man, with deep emotion. ""No, no! Ihave still to bring it to perfection. Yesterday, towards evening, Ithought it was finished. Her eyes were liquid, her flesh trembled, hertresses waved--she breathed! And yet, though I have grasped the secretof rendering on a flat canvas the relief and roundness of nature, thismorning at dawn I saw many errors. Ah! to attain that glorious result,I have studied to their depths the masters of color. I have analyzed andlifted, layer by layer, the colors of Titian, king of light. Like him,great sovereign of art, I have sketched my figure in light clear tonesof supple yet solid color; for shadow is but an accident,--rememberthat, young man. Then I worked backward, as it were; and by means ofhalf-tints, and glazings whose transparency I kept diminishing little bylittle, I was able to cast strong shadows deepening almost to blackness.The shadows of ordinary painters are not of the same texture as theirtones of light. They are wood, brass, iron, anything you please exceptflesh in shadow. We feel that if the figures changed position the shadyplaces would not be wiped off, and would remain dark spots which nevercould be made luminous. I have avoided that blunder, though many of ourmost illustrious painters have fallen into it. In my work you will seewhiteness beneath the opacity of the broadest shadow. Unlike the crowdof ignoramuses, who fancy they draw correctly because they can paint onegood vanishing line, I have not dryly outlined my figures, nor broughtout superstitiously minute anatomical details; for, let me tell you, thehuman body does not end off with a line. In that respect sculptors getnearer to the truth of nature than we do. Nature is all curves, eachwrapping or overlapping another. To speak rigorously, there is no suchthing as drawing. Do not laugh, young man; no matter how strange thatsaying seems to you, you will understand the reasons for it one of thesedays. A line is a means by which man explains to himself the effectof light upon a given object; but there is no such thing as a line innature, where all things are rounded and full. It is only in modellingthat we really draw,--in other words, that we detach things from theirsurroundings and put them in their due relief. The proper distributionof light can alone reveal the whole body. For this reason I do notsharply define lineaments; I diffuse about their outline a haze of warm,light half-tints, so that I defy any one to place a finger on the exactspot where the parts join the groundwork of the picture. If seen nearby this sort of work has a woolly effect, and is wanting in nicety andprecision; but go a few steps off and the parts fall into place; theytake their proper form and detach themselves,--the body turns, the limbsstand out, we feel the air circulating around them.""Nevertheless,"" he continued, sadly, ""I am not satisfied; there aremoments when I have my doubts. Perhaps it would be better not to sketcha single line. I ask myself if I ought not to grasp the figure first byits highest lights, and then work down to the darker portions. Is notthat the method of the sun, divine painter of the universe? O Nature,Nature! who has ever caught thee in thy flights? Alas! the heights ofknowledge, like the depths of ignorance, lead to unbelief. I doubt mywork.""The old man paused, then resumed. ""For ten years I have worked, youngman; but what are ten short years in the long struggle with Nature? Wedo not know the type it cost Pygmalion to make the only statue that everwalked--""He fell into a reverie and remained, with fixed eyes, oblivious of allabout him, playing mechanically with his knife.""See, he is talking to his own soul,"" said Porbus in a low voice.The words acted like a spell on Nicolas Poussin, filling him with theinexplicable curiosity of a true artist. The strange old man, with hiswhite eyes fixed in stupor, became to the wondering youth something morethan a man; he seemed a fantastic spirit inhabiting an unknown sphere,and waking by its touch confused ideas within the soul. We can no moredefine the moral phenomena of this species of fascination than we canrender in words the emotions excited in the heart of an exile by a songwhich recalls his fatherland. The contempt which the old man affectedto pour upon the noblest efforts of art, his wealth, his manners,the respectful deference shown to him by Porbus, his work guarded sosecretly,--a work of patient toil, a work no doubt of genius, judging bythe head of the Virgin which Poussin had so naively admired, and which,beautiful beside even the Adam of Mabuse, betrayed the imperial touch ofa great artist,--in short, everything about the strange old man seemedbeyond the limits of human nature. The rich imagination of the youthfastened upon the one perceptible and clear clew to the mystery of thissupernatural being,--the presence of the artistic nature, that wildimpassioned nature to which such mighty powers have been confided, whichtoo often abuses those powers, and drags cold reason and common souls,and even lovers of art, over stony and arid places, where for suchthere is neither pleasure nor instruction; while to the artistic soulitself,--that white-winged angel of sportive fancy,--epics, works ofart, and visions rise along the way. It is a nature, an essence, mockingyet kind, fruitful though destitute. Thus, for the enthusiastic Poussin,the old man became by sudden transfiguration Art itself,--art with allits secrets, its transports, and its dreams.""Yes, my dear Porbus,"" said Frenhofer, speaking half in reverie, ""I havenever yet beheld a perfect woman; a body whose outlines were faultlessand whose flesh-tints--Ah! where lives she?"" he cried, interrupting hisown words; ""where lives the lost Venus of the ancients, so long soughtfor, whose scattered beauty we snatch by glimpses? Oh! to see for amoment, a single moment, the divine completed nature,--the ideal,--Iwould give my all of fortune. Yes; I would search thee out, celestialBeauty! in thy farthest sphere. Like Orpheus, I would go down to hell towin back the life of art--""""Let us go,"" said Porbus to Poussin; ""he neither sees nor hears us anylonger.""""Let us go to his atelier,"" said the wonder-struck young man.""Oh! the old dragon has guarded the entrance. His treasure is out of ourreach. I have not waited for your wish or urging to attempt an assaulton the mystery.""""Mystery! then there is a mystery?""""Yes,"" answered Porbus. ""Frenhofer was the only pupil Mabuse was willingto teach. He became the friend, saviour, father of that unhappy man, andhe sacrificed the greater part of his wealth to satisfy the mad passionsof his master. In return, Mabuse bequeathed to him the secret of relief,the power of giving life to form,--that flower of nature, our perpetualdespair, which Mabuse had seized so well that once, having sold anddrunk the value of a flowered damask which he should have worn atthe entrance of Charles V., he made his appearance in a paper garmentpainted to resemble damask. The splendor of the stuff attracted theattention of the emperor, who, wishing to compliment the old drunkard,laid a hand upon his shoulder and discovered the deception. Frenhofer isa man carried away by the passion of his art; he sees above and beyondwhat other painters see. He has meditated deeply on color and theabsolute truth of lines; but by dint of much research, much thought,much study, he has come to doubt the object for which he is searching.In his hours of despair he fancies that drawing does not exist, and thatlines can render nothing but geometric figures. That, of course, is nottrue; because with a black line which has no color we can representthe human form. This proves that our art is made up, like nature, of aninfinite number of elements. Drawing gives the skeleton, and color givesthe life; but life without the skeleton is a far more incompletething than the skeleton without the life. But there is a higher truthstill,--namely, that practice and observation are the essentials ofa painter; and that if reason and poesy persist in wrangling with thetools, the brushes, we shall be brought to doubt, like Frenhofer, whois as much excited in brain as he is exalted in art. A sublime painter,indeed; but he had the misfortune to be born rich, and that enables himto stray into theory and conjecture. Do not imitate him. Work! work!painters should theorize with their brushes in their hands.""""We will contrive to get in,"" cried Poussin, not listening to Porbus,and thinking only of the hidden masterpiece.Porbus smiled at the youth\'s enthusiasm, and bade him farewell with akindly invitation to come and visit him.              *     *     *     *     *Nicolas Poussin returned slowly towards the Rue de la Harpe and passed,without observing that he did so, the modest hostelry where he waslodging. Returning presently upon his steps, he ran up the miserablestairway with anxious rapidity until he reached an upper chambernestling between the joists of a roof ""en colombage,""--the plain, slightcovering of the houses of old Paris. Near the single and gloomy windowof the room sat a young girl, who rose quickly as the door opened, witha gesture of love; she had recognized the young man\'s touch upon thelatch.""What is the matter?"" she asked.""It is--it is,"" he cried, choking with joy, ""that I feel myself apainter! I have doubted it till now; but to-day I believe in myself. Ican be a great man. Ah, Gillette, we shall be rich, happy! There is goldin these brushes!""Suddenly he became silent. His grave and earnest face lost itsexpression of joy; he was comparing the immensity of his hopes with themediocrity of his means. The walls of the garret were covered with bitsof paper on which were crayon sketches; he possessed only four cleancanvases. Colors were at that time costly, and the poor gentleman gazedat a palette that was well-nigh bare. In the midst of this povertyhe felt within himself an indescribable wealth of heart and thesuperabundant force of consuming genius. Brought to Paris by a gentlemanof his acquaintance, and perhaps by the monition of his own talent, hehad suddenly found a mistress,--one of those generous and noble soulswho are ready to suffer by the side of a great man; espousing hispoverty, studying to comprehend his caprices, strong to bear deprivationand bestow love, as others are daring in the display of luxury and inparading the insensibility of their hearts. The smile which flickered onher lips brightened as with gold the darkness of the garret and rivalledthe effulgence of the skies; for the sun did not always shine in theheavens, but she was always here,--calm and collected in her passion,living in his happiness, his griefs; sustaining the genius whichoverflowed in love ere it found in art its destined expression.""Listen, Gillette; come!""The obedient, happy girl sprang lightly on the painter\'s knee. She wasall grace and beauty, pretty as the spring-time, decked with the wealthof feminine charm, and lighting all with the fire of a noble soul.""O God!"" he exclaimed, ""I can never tell her!""""A secret!"" she cried; ""then I must know it.""Poussin was lost in thought.""Tell me.""""Gillette, poor, beloved heart!""""Ah! do you want something of me?""""Yes.""""If you want me to pose as I did the other day,"" she said, with a littlepouting air, ""I will not do it. Your eyes say nothing to me, then. Youlook at me, but you do not think of me.""""Would you like me to copy another woman?""""Perhaps,"" she answered, ""if she were very ugly.""""Well,"" continued Poussin, in a grave tone, ""if to make me a greatpainter it were necessary to pose to some one else--""""You are testing me,"" she interrupted; ""you know well that I would notdo it.""Poussin bent his head upon his breast like a man succumbing to joy orgrief too great for his spirit to bear.""Listen,"" she said, pulling him by the sleeve of his worn doublet,""I told you, Nick, that I would give my life for you; but I neversaid--never!--that I, a living woman, would renounce my love.""""Renounce it?"" cried Poussin.""If I showed myself thus to another you would love me no longer; and Imyself, I should feel unworthy of your love. To obey your caprices, ah,that is simple and natural! in spite of myself, I am proud and happy indoing thy dear will; but to another, fy!""""Forgive me, my own Gillette,"" said the painter, throwing himself at herfeet. ""I would rather be loved than famous. To me thou art more preciousthan fortune and honors. Yes, away with these brushes! burn thosesketches! I have been mistaken. My vocation is to love thee,--theealone! I am not a painter, I am thy lover. Perish art and all itssecrets!""She looked at him admiringly, happy and captivated by his passion. Shereigned; she felt instinctively that the arts were forgotten for hersake, and flung at her feet like grains of incense.""Yet he is only an old man,"" resumed Poussin. ""In you he would see onlya woman. You are the perfect woman whom he seeks.""""Love should grant all things!"" she exclaimed, ready to sacrifice love\'sscruples to reward the lover who thus seemed to sacrifice his art toher. ""And yet,"" she added, ""it would be my ruin. Ah, to suffer for thygood! Yes, it is glorious! But thou wilt forget me. How came this cruelthought into thy mind?""""It came there, and yet I love thee,"" he said, with a sort ofcontrition. ""Am I, then, a wretch?""""Let us consult Pere Hardouin.""""No, no! it must be a secret between us.""""Well, I will go; but thou must not be present,"" she said. ""Stay at thedoor, armed with thy dagger. If I cry out, enter and kill the man.""Forgetting all but his art, Poussin clasped her in his arms.""He loves me no longer!"" thought Gillette, when she was once more alone.She regretted her promise. But before long she fell a prey to an anguishfar more cruel than her regret; and she struggled vainly to drive fortha terrible fear which forced its way into her mind. She felt that sheloved him less as the suspicion rose in her heart that he was lessworthy than she had thought him.']"
79,3,Chapter 3,"['IIThree months after the first meeting of Porbus and Poussin, the formerwent to see Maitre Frenhofer. He found the old man a prey to one ofthose deep, self-developed discouragements, whose cause, if we are tobelieve the mathematicians of health, lies in a bad digestion, in thewind, in the weather, in some swelling of the intestines, or else,according to casuists, in the imperfections of our moral nature; thefact being that the good man was simply worn out by the effort tocomplete his mysterious picture. He was seated languidly in a largeoaken chair of vast dimensions covered with black leather; and withoutchanging his melancholy attitude he cast on Porbus the distant glance ofa man sunk in absolute dejection.""Well, maitre,"" said Porbus, ""was the distant ultra-marine, for whichyou journeyed to Brussels, worthless? Are you unable to grind a newwhite? Is the oil bad, or the brushes restive?""""Alas!"" cried the old man, ""I thought for one moment that my work wasaccomplished; but I must have deceived myself in some of the details. Ishall have no peace until I clear up my doubts. I am about to travel;I go to Turkey, Asia, Greece, in search of models. I must compare mypicture with various types of Nature. It may be that I have up _there_,""he added, letting a smile of satisfaction flicker on his lip, ""Natureherself. At times I am half afraid that a brush may wake this woman, andthat she will disappear from sight.""He rose suddenly, as if to depart at once. ""Wait,"" exclaimed Porbus.""I have come in time to spare you the costs and fatigues of such ajourney.""""How so?"" asked Frenhofer, surprised.""Young Poussin is beloved by a woman whose incomparable beauty iswithout imperfection. But, my dear master, if he consents to lend her toyou, at least you must let us see your picture.""The old man remained standing, motionless, in a state bordering onstupefaction. ""What!"" he at last exclaimed, mournfully. ""Show mycreature, my spouse?--tear off the veil with which I have chastelyhidden my joy? It would be prostitution! For ten years I have lived withthis woman; she is mine, mine alone! she loves me! Has she not smiledupon me as, touch by touch, I painted her? She has a soul,--the soulwith which I endowed her. She would blush if other eyes than mine beheldher. Let her be seen?--where is the husband, the lover, so debased as tolend his wife to dishonor? When you paint a picture for the court you donot put your whole soul into it; you sell to courtiers your tricked-outlay-figures. My painting is not a picture; it is a sentiment, a passion!Born in my atelier, she must remain a virgin there. She shall not leaveit unclothed. Poesy and women give themselves bare, like truth, tolovers only. Have we the model of Raphael, the Angelica of Ariosto, theBeatrice of Dante? No, we see but their semblance. Well, the work whichI keep hidden behind bolts and bars is an exception to all other art. Itis not a canvas; it is a woman,--a woman with whom I weep and laughand think and talk. Would you have me resign the joy of ten years, as Imight throw away a worn-out doublet? Shall I, in a moment, cease tobe father, lover, creator?--this woman is not a creature; she is mycreation. Bring your young man; I will give him my treasures,--paintingsof Correggio, Michael-Angelo, Titian; I will kiss the print of his feetin the dust,--but make him my rival? Shame upon me! Ha! I am more alover than I am a painter. I shall have the strength to burn my Nut-girlere I render my last sigh; but suffer her to endure the glance of a man,a young man, a painter?--No, no! I would kill on the morrow the man whopolluted her with a look! I would kill you,--you, my friend,--if you didnot worship her on your knees; and think you I would submit my idol tothe cold eyes and stupid criticisms of fools? Ah, love is a mystery! itslife is in the depths of the soul; it dies when a man says, even to hisfriend, Here is she whom I love.""The old man seemed to renew his youth; his eyes had the brilliancy andfire of life, his pale cheeks blushed a vivid red, his hands trembled.Porbus, amazed by the passionate violence with which he uttered thesewords, knew not how to answer a feeling so novel and yet so profound.Was the old man under the thraldom of an artist\'s fancy? Or did theseideas flow from the unspeakable fanaticism produced at times in everymind by the long gestation of a noble work? Was it possible to bargainwith this strange and whimsical being?Filled with such thoughts, Porbus said to the old man, ""Is it not womanfor woman? Poussin lends his mistress to your eyes.""""What sort of mistress is that?"" cried Frenhofer. ""She will betray himsooner or later. Mine will be to me forever faithful.""""Well,"" returned Porbus, ""then let us say no more. But before you find,even in Asia, a woman as beautiful, as perfect, as the one I speak of,you may be dead, and your picture forever unfinished.""""Oh, it is finished!"" said Frenhofer. ""Whoever sees it will find a womanlying on a velvet bed, beneath curtains; perfumes are exhaling from agolden tripod by her side: he will be tempted to take the tassels ofthe cord that holds back the curtain; he will think he sees the bosom ofCatherine Lescaut,--a model called the Beautiful Nut-girl; he will seeit rise and fall with the movement of her breathing. Yet--I wish I couldbe sure--""""Go to Asia, then,"" said Porbus hastily, fancying he saw some hesitationin the old man\'s eye.Porbus made a few steps towards the door of the room. At this momentGillette and Nicolas Poussin reached the entrance of the house. As theyoung girl was about to enter, she dropped the arm of her lover andshrank back as if overcome by a presentiment. ""What am I doing here?""she said to Poussin, in a deep voice, looking at him fixedly.""Gillette, I leave you mistress of your actions; I will obey your will.You are my conscience, my glory. Come home; I shall be happy, perhaps,if you, yourself--""""Have I a self when you speak thus to me? Oh, no! I am but a child.Come,"" she continued, seeming to make a violent effort. ""If our loveperishes, if I put into my heart a long regret, thy fame shall bethe guerdon of my obedience to thy will. Let us enter. I may yet liveagain,--a memory on thy palette.""Opening the door of the house the two lovers met Porbus coming out.Astonished at the beauty of the young girl, whose eyes were still wetwith tears, he caught her all trembling by the hand and led her to theold master.""There!"" he cried; ""is she not worth all the masterpieces in the world?""Frenhofer quivered. Gillette stood before him in the ingenuous, simpleattitude of a young Georgian, innocent and timid, captured by brigandsand offered to a slave-merchant. A modest blush suffused her cheeks,her eyes were lowered, her hands hung at her sides, strength seemed toabandon her, and her tears protested against the violence done to herpurity. Poussin cursed himself, and repented of his folly in bringingthis treasure from their peaceful garret. Once more he became a loverrather than an artist; scruples convulsed his heart as he saw the eye ofthe old painter regain its youth and, with the artist\'s habit, disrobeas it were the beauteous form of the young girl. He was seized with thejealous frenzy of a true lover.""Gillette!"" he cried; ""let us go.""At this cry, with its accent of love, his mistress raised her eyesjoyfully and looked at him; then she ran into his arms.""Ah! you love me still?"" she whispered, bursting into tears.Though she had had strength to hide her suffering, she had none to hideher joy.""Let me have her for one moment,"" exclaimed the old master, ""and youshall compare her with my Catherine. Yes, yes; I consent!""There was love in the cry of Frenhofer as in that of Poussin, mingledwith jealous coquetry on behalf of his semblance of a woman; he seemedto revel in the triumph which the beauty of his virgin was about to winover the beauty of the living woman.""Do not let him retract,"" cried Porbus, striking Poussin on theshoulder. ""The fruits of love wither in a day; those of art areimmortal.""""Can it be,"" said Gillette, looking steadily at Poussin and at Porbus,""that I am nothing more than a woman to him?""She raised her head proudly; and as she glanced at Frenhofer withflashing eyes she saw her lover gazing once more at the picture he hadformerly taken for a Giorgione.""Ah!"" she cried, ""let us go in; he never looked at me like that!""""Old man!"" said Poussin, roused from his meditation by Gillette\'s voice,""see this sword. I will plunge it into your heart at the first cry ofthat young girl. I will set fire to your house, and no one shall escapefrom it. Do you understand me?""His look was gloomy and the tones of his voice were terrible. Hisattitude, and above all the gesture with which he laid his hand uponthe weapon, comforted the poor girl, who half forgave him for thussacrificing her to his art and to his hopes of a glorious future.Porbus and Poussin remained outside the closed door of the atelier,looking at one another in silence. At first the painter of the EgyptianMary uttered a few exclamations: ""Ah, she unclothes herself!""--""He tellsher to stand in the light!""--""He compares them!"" but he grew silent ashe watched the mournful face of the young man; for though old paintershave none of such petty scruples in presence of their art, yet theyadmire them in others, when they are fresh and pleasing. The young manheld his hand on his sword, and his ear seemed glued to the panel of thedoor. Both men, standing darkly in the shadow, looked like conspiratorswaiting the hour to strike a tyrant.""Come in! come in!"" cried the old man, beaming with happiness. ""My workis perfect; I can show it now with pride. Never shall painter, brushes,colors, canvas, light, produce the rival of Catherine Lescaut, theBeautiful Nut-girl.""Porbus and Poussin, seized with wild curiosity, rushed into the middleof a vast atelier filled with dust, where everything lay in disorder,and where they saw a few paintings hanging here and there upon thewalls. They stopped before the figure of a woman, life-sized and halfnude, which filled them with eager admiration.""Do not look at that,"" said Frenhofer, ""it is only a daub which I madeto study a pose; it is worth nothing. Those are my errors,"" he added,waving his hand towards the enchanting compositions on the walls aroundthem.At these words Porbus and Poussin, amazed at the disdain which themaster showed for such marvels of art, looked about them for the secrettreasure, but could see it nowhere.""There it is!"" said the old man, whose hair fell in disorder about hisface, which was scarlet with supernatural excitement. His eyes sparkled,and his breast heaved like that of a young man beside himself with love.""Ah!"" he cried, ""did you not expect such perfection? You stand before awoman, and you are looking for a picture! There are such depths on thatcanvas, the air within it is so true, that you are unable to distinguishit from the air you breathe. Where is art? Departed, vanished! Here isthe form itself of a young girl. Have I not caught the color, the verylife of the line which seems to terminate the body? The same phenomenonwhich we notice around fishes in the water is also about objects whichfloat in air. See how these outlines spring forth from the background.Do you not feel that you could pass your hand behind those shoulders?For seven years have I studied these effects of light coupled withform. That hair,--is it not bathed in light? Why, she breathes! Thatbosom,--see! Ah! who would not worship it on bended knee? The fleshpalpitates! Wait, she is about to rise; wait!""""Can you see anything?"" whispered Poussin to Porbus.""Nothing. Can you?""""No.""The two painters drew back, leaving the old man absorbed in ecstasy,and tried to see if the light, falling plumb upon the canvas at which hepointed, had neutralized all effects. They examined the picture, movingfrom right to left, standing directly before it, bending, swaying,rising by turns.""Yes, yes; it is really a canvas,"" cried Frenhofer, mistaking thepurpose of their examination. ""See, here is the frame, the easel; theseare my colors, my brushes."" And he caught up a brush which he held outto them with a naive motion.""The old rogue is making game of us,"" said Poussin, coming close to thepretended picture. ""I can see nothing here but a mass of confused color,crossed by a multitude of eccentric lines, making a sort of paintedwall.""""We are mistaken. See!"" returned Porbus.Coming nearer, they perceived in a corner of the canvas the point of anaked foot, which came forth from the chaos of colors, tones, shadowshazy and undefined, misty and without form,--an enchanting foot, aliving foot. They stood lost in admiration before this glorious fragmentbreaking forth from the incredible, slow, progressive destructionaround it. The foot seemed to them like the torso of some Grecian Venus,brought to light amid the ruins of a burned city.""There is a woman beneath it all!"" cried Porbus, calling Poussin\'sattention to the layers of color which the old painter had successivelylaid on, believing that he thus brought his work to perfection. The twomen turned towards him with one accord, beginning to comprehend, thoughvaguely, the ecstasy in which he lived.""He means it in good faith,"" said Porbus.""Yes, my friend,"" answered the old man, rousing from his abstraction,""we need faith; faith in art. We must live with our work for yearsbefore we can produce a creation like that. Some of these shadows havecost me endless toil. See, there on her cheek, below the eyes, a fainthalf-shadow; if you observed it in Nature you might think it couldhardly be rendered. Well, believe me, I took unheard-of pains toreproduce that effect. My dear Porbus, look attentively at my work, andyou will comprehend what I have told you about the manner of treatingform and outline. Look at the light on the bosom, and see how by aseries of touches and higher lights firmly laid on I have managed tograsp light itself, and combine it with the dazzling whiteness of theclearer tones; and then see how, by an opposite method,--smoothing offthe sharp contrasts and the texture of the color,--I have been able,by caressing the outline of my figure and veiling it with cloudyhalf-tints, to do away with the very idea of drawing and all otherartificial means, and give to the form the aspect and roundness ofNature itself. Come nearer, and you will see the work more distinctly;if too far off it disappears. See! there, at that point, it is, I think,most remarkable."" And with the end of his brush he pointed to a spot ofclear light color.Porbus struck the old man on the shoulder, turning to Poussin as he didso, and said, ""Do you know that he is one of our greatest painters?""""He is a poet even more than he is a painter,"" answered Poussin gravely.""There,"" returned Porbus, touching the canvas, ""is the ultimate end ofour art on earth.""""And from thence,"" added Poussin, ""it rises, to enter heaven.""""How much happiness is there!--upon that canvas,"" said Porbus.The absorbed old man gave no heed to their words; he was smiling at hisvisionary woman.""But sooner or later, he will perceive that there is nothing there,""cried Poussin.""Nothing there!--upon my canvas?"" said Frenhofer, looking first at thetwo painters, and then at his imaginary picture.""What have you done?"" cried Porbus, addressing Poussin.The old man seized the arm of the young man violently, and said to him,""You see nothing?--clown, infidel, scoundrel, dolt! Why did you comehere? My good Porbus,"" he added, turning to his friend, ""is it possiblethat you, too, are jesting with me? Answer; I am your friend. Tell me,can it be that I have spoiled my picture?""Porbus hesitated, and feared to speak; but the anxiety painted on thewhite face of the old man was so cruel that he was constrained to pointto the canvas and utter the word, ""See!""Frenhofer looked at his picture for a space of a moment, and staggered.""Nothing! nothing! after toiling ten years!""He sat down and wept.""Am I then a fool, an idiot? Have I neither talent nor capacity? Am Ino better than a rich man who walks, and can only walk? Have I indeedproduced nothing?""He gazed at the canvas through tears. Suddenly he raised himself proudlyand flung a lightning glance upon the two painters.""By the blood, by the body, by the head of Christ, you are envious menwho seek to make me think she is spoiled, that you may steal her fromme. I--I see her!"" he cried. ""She is wondrously beautiful!""At this moment Poussin heard the weeping of Gillette as she stood,forgotten, in a corner.""What troubles thee, my darling?"" asked the painter, becoming once morea lover.""Kill me!"" she answered. ""I should be infamous if I still loved thee,for I despise thee. I admire thee; but thou hast filled me with horror.I love, and yet already I hate thee.""While Poussin listened to Gillette, Frenhofer drew a green curtainbefore his Catherine, with the grave composure of a jeweller lockinghis drawers when he thinks that thieves are near him. He cast at the twopainters a look which was profoundly dissimulating, full of contempt andsuspicion; then, with convulsive haste, he silently pushed them throughthe door of his atelier. When they reached the threshold of his house hesaid to them, ""Adieu, my little friends.""The tone of this farewell chilled the two painters with fear.              *     *     *     *     *On the morrow Porbus, alarmed, went again to visit Frenhofer, and foundthat he had died during the night, after having burned his paintings.End of Project Gutenberg\'s The Hidden Masterpiece, by Honore de Balzac END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HIDDEN MASTERPIECE ** This file should be named 1553.txt or 1553.zip **This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/5/1553/Produced by John Bickers, and DagnyUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

80,2,Chapter 2,"['I. AN OLD MONASTERY""Come, deputy of the Centre, forward! Quick step! march! if we want tobe in time to dine with the others. Jump, marquis! there, that\'s right!why, you can skip across a stubble-field like a deer!""These words were said by a huntsman peacefully seated at the edge of theforest of Ile-Adam, who was finishing an Havana cigar while waiting forhis companion, who had lost his way in the tangled underbrush of thewood. At his side four panting dogs were watching, as he did, thepersonage he addressed. To understand how sarcastic were theseexhortations, repeated at intervals, we should state that theapproaching huntsman was a stout little man whose protuberant stomachwas the evidence of a truly ministerial ""embonpoint."" He was strugglingpainfully across the furrows of a vast wheat-field recently harvested,the stubble of which considerably impeded him; while to add to his othermiseries the sun\'s rays, striking obliquely on his face, collected anabundance of drops of perspiration. Absorbed in the effort to maintainhis equilibrium, he leaned, now forward, now back, in close imitationof the pitching of a carriage when violently jolted. The weather lookedthreatening. Though several spaces of blue sky still parted the thickblack clouds toward the horizon, a flock of fleecy vapors were advancingwith great rapidity and drawing a light gray curtain from east towest. As the wind was acting only on the upper region of the air, theatmosphere below it pressed down the hot vapors of the earth. Surroundedby masses of tall trees, the valley through which the hunter struggledfelt like a furnace. Parched and silent, the forest seemed thirsty. Thebirds, even the insects, were voiceless; the tree-tops scarcely waved.Those persons who may still remember the summer of 1819 can imagine thewoes of the poor deputy, who was struggling along, drenched in sweat,to regain his mocking friend. The latter, while smoking his cigar, hadcalculated from the position of the sun that it must be about five inthe afternoon.""Where the devil are we?"" said the stout huntsman, mopping hisforehead and leaning against the trunk of a tree nearly opposite tohis companion, for he felt unequal to the effort of leaping the ditchbetween them.""That\'s for me to ask you,"" said the other, laughing, as he lay amongthe tall brown brake which crowned the bank. Then, throwing the end ofhis cigar into the ditch, he cried out vehemently: ""I swear by SaintHubert that never again will I trust myself in unknown territory with astatesman, though he be, like you, my dear d\'Albon, a college mate.""""But, Philippe, have you forgotten your French? Or have you left yourwits in Siberia?"" replied the stout man, casting a sorrowfully comiclook at a sign-post about a hundred feet away.""True, true,"" cried Philippe, seizing his gun and springing with a boundinto the field and thence to the post. ""This way, d\'Albon, this way,""he called back to his friend, pointing to a broad paved path and readingaloud the sign: ""\'From Baillet to Ile-Adam.\' We shall certainly findthe path to Cassan, which must branch from this one between here andIle-Adam.""""You are right, colonel,"" said Monsieur d\'Albon, replacing upon his headthe cap with which he had been fanning himself.""Forward then, my respectable privy councillor,"" replied ColonelPhilippe, whistling to the dogs, who seemed more willing to obey himthan the public functionary to whom they belonged.""Are you aware, marquis,"" said the jeering soldier, ""that we still havesix miles to go? That village over there must be Baillet.""""Good heavens!"" cried the marquis, ""go to Cassan if you must, but you\'llgo alone. I prefer to stay here, in spite of the coming storm, andwait for the horse you can send me from the chateau. You\'ve played me atrick, Sucy. We were to have had a nice little hunt not far from Cassan,and beaten the coverts I know. Instead of that, you have kept me runninglike a hare since four o\'clock this morning, and all I\'ve had forbreakfast is a cup of milk. Now, if you ever have a petition before theCourt, I\'ll make you lose it, however just your claim.""The poor discouraged huntsman sat down on a stone that supported thesignpost, relieved himself of his gun and his gamebag, and heaved a longsigh.""France! such are thy deputies!"" exclaimed Colonel de Sucy, laughing.""Ah! my poor d\'Albon, if you had been like me six years in the wilds ofSiberia--""He said no more, but he raised his eyes to heaven as if that anguishwere between himself and God.""Come, march on!"" he added. ""If you sit still you are lost.""""How can I, Philippe? It is an old magisterial habit to sit still. On myhonor! I\'m tired out--If I had only killed a hare!""The two men presented a rather rare contrast: the public functionarywas forty-two years of age and seemed no more than thirty, whereas thesoldier was thirty, and seemed forty at the least. Both wore the redrosette of the officers of the Legion of honor. A few spare locks ofblack hair mixed with white, like the wing of a magpie, escaped fromthe colonel\'s cap, while handsome brown curls adorned the brow of thestatesman. One was tall, gallant, high-strung, and the lines of hispallid face showed terrible passions or frightful griefs. The otherhad a face that was brilliant with health, and jovially worth of anepicurean. Both were deeply sun-burned, and their high gaiters of tannedleather showed signs of the bogs and the thickets they had just comethrough.""Come,"" said Monsieur de Sucy, ""let us get on. A short hour\'s march, andwe shall reach Cassan in time for a good dinner.""""It is easy to see you have never loved,"" replied the councillor, with alook that was pitifully comic; ""you are as relentless as article 304 ofthe penal code.""Philippe de Sucy quivered; his broad brow contracted; his face becameas sombre as the skies above them. Some memory of awful bitternessdistorted for a moment his features, but he said nothing. Like allstrong men, he drove down his emotions to the depths of his heart;thinking perhaps, as simple characters are apt to think, that there wassomething immodest in unveiling griefs when human language cannotrender their depths and may only rouse the mockery of those who do notcomprehend them. Monsieur d\'Albon had one of those delicate natureswhich divine sorrows, and are instantly sympathetic to the emotion theyhave involuntarily aroused. He respected his friend\'s silence, rose,forgot his fatigue, and followed him silently, grieved to have touched awound that was evidently not healed.""Some day, my friend,"" said Philippe, pressing his hand, and thankinghim for his mute repentance by a heart-rending look, ""I will relate toyou my life. To-day I cannot.""They continued their way in silence. When the colonel\'s pain seemedsoothed, the marquis resumed his fatigue; and with the instinct, orrather the will, of a wearied man his eye took in the very depths of theforest; he questioned the tree-tops and examined the branching paths,hoping to discover some dwelling where he could ask hospitality.Arriving at a cross-ways, he thought he noticed a slight smoke risingamong the trees; he stopped, looked more attentively, and saw, in themidst of a vast copse, the dark-green branches of several pine-trees.""A house! a house!"" he cried, with the joy the sailor feels in crying""Land!""Then he sprang quickly into the copse, and the colonel, who had falleninto a deep reverie, followed him mechanically.""I\'d rather get an omelet, some cottage bread, and a chair here,"" hesaid, ""than go to Cassan for sofas, truffles, and Bordeaux.""These words were an exclamation of enthusiasm, elicited from thecouncillor on catching sight of a wall, the white towers of whichglimmered in the distance through the brown masses of the tree trunks.""Ha! ha! this looks to me as if it had once been a priory,"" cried themarquis, as they reached a very old and blackened gate, through whichthey could see, in the midst of a large park, a building constructed inthe style of the monasteries of old. ""How those rascals the monks knewhow to choose their sites!""This last exclamation was an expression of surprise and pleasure at thepoetical hermitage which met his eyes. The house stood on the slope ofthe mountain, at the summit of which is the village of Nerville. Thegreat centennial oaks of the forest which encircled the dwelling madethe place an absolute solitude. The main building, formerly occupied bythe monks, faced south. The park seemed to have about forty acres.Near the house lay a succession of green meadows, charmingly crossed byseveral clear rivulets, with here and there a piece of water naturallyplaced without the least apparent artifice. Trees of elegant shape andvaried foliage were distributed about. Grottos, cleverly managed, andmassive terraces with dilapidated steps and rusty railings, gavea peculiar character to this lone retreat. Art had harmonized herconstructions with the picturesque effects of nature. Human passionsseemed to die at the feet of those great trees, which guarded thisasylum from the tumult of the world as they shaded it from the fires ofthe sun.""How desolate!"" thought Monsieur d\'Albon, observing the sombreexpression which the ancient building gave to the landscape, gloomy asthough a curse were on it. It seemed a fatal spot deserted by man. Ivyhad stretched its tortuous muscles, covered by its rich green mantle,everywhere. Brown or green, red or yellow mosses and lichen spread theirromantic tints on trees and seats and roofs and stones. The crumblingwindow-casings were hollowed by rain, defaced by time; the balconieswere broken, the terraces demolished. Some of the outside shutters hungfrom a single hinge. The rotten doors seemed quite unable to resist anassailant. Covered with shining tufts of mistletoe, the branches of theneglected fruit-trees gave no sign of fruit. Grass grew in the paths.Such ruin and desolation cast a weird poesy on the scene, filling thesouls of the spectators with dreamy thoughts. A poet would have stoodthere long, plunged in a melancholy reverie, admiring this disorderso full of harmony, this destruction which was not without its grace.Suddenly, the brown tiles shone, the mosses glittered, fantastic shadowsdanced upon the meadows and beneath the trees; fading colors revived;striking contrasts developed, the foliage of the trees and shrubsdefined itself more clearly in the light. Then--the light went out. Thelandscape seemed to have spoken, and now was silent, returning to itsgloom, or rather to the soft sad tones of an autumnal twilight.""It is the palace of the Sleeping Beauty,"" said the marquis, beginningto view the house with the eyes of a land owner. ""I wonder to whom itbelongs! He must be a stupid fellow not to live in such an exquisitespot.""At that instant a woman sprang from beneath a chestnut-tree standing tothe right of the gate, and, without making any noise, passed before themarquis as rapidly as the shadow of a cloud. This vision made him mutewith surprise.""Why, Albon, what\'s the matter?"" asked the colonel.""I am rubbing my eyes to know if I am asleep or awake,"" replied themarquis, with his face close to the iron rails as he tried to getanother sight of the phantom.""She must be beneath that fig-tree,"" he said, pointing to the foliage ofa tree which rose above the wall to the left of the gate.""She! who?""""How can I tell?"" replied Monsieur d\'Albon. ""A strange woman rose upthere, just before me,"" he said in a low voice; ""she seemed to come fromthe world of shades rather than from the land of the living. She is soslender, so light, so filmy, she must be diaphanous. Her face was aswhite as milk; her eyes, her clothes, her hair jet black. She lookedat me as she flitted by, and though I may say I\'m no coward, that coldimmovable look froze the blood in my veins.""""Is she pretty?"" asked Philippe.""I don\'t know. I could see nothing but the eyes in that face.""""Well, let the dinner at Cassan go to the devil!"" cried the colonel.""Suppose we stay here. I have a sudden childish desire to enter thatsingular house. Do you see those window-frames painted red, and the redlines on the doors and shutters? Doesn\'t the place look to you as if itbelonged to the devil?--perhaps he inherited it from the monks. Come,let us pursue the black and white lady--forward, march!"" cried Philippe,with forced gaiety.At that instant the two huntsmen heard a cry that was something likethat of a mouse caught in a trap. They listened. The rustle of a fewshrubs sounded in the silence like the murmur of a breaking wave. Invain they listened for other sounds; the earth was dumb, and kept thesecret of those light steps, if, indeed, the unknown woman moved at all.""It is very singular!"" said Philippe, as they skirted the park wall.The two friends presently reached a path in the forest which led to thevillage of Chauvry. After following this path some way toward the mainroad to Paris, they came to another iron gate which led to the principalfacade of the mysterious dwelling. On this side the dilapidation anddisorder of the premises had reached their height. Immense cracksfurrowed the walls of the house, which was built on three sides ofa square. Fragments of tiles and slates lying on the ground, and thedilapidated condition of the roofs, were evidence of a total want ofcare on the part of the owners. The fruit had fallen from the trees andlay rotting on the ground; a cow was feeding on the lawn and treadingdown the flowers in the borders, while a goat browsed on the shoots ofthe vines and munched the unripe grapes.""Here all is harmony; the devastation seems organized,"" said thecolonel, pulling the chain of a bell; but the bell was without aclapper.The huntsmen heard nothing but the curiously sharp noise of a rustyspring. Though very dilapidated, a little door made in the wall besidethe iron gates resisted all their efforts to open it.""Well, well, this is getting to be exciting,"" said de Sucy to hiscompanion.""If I were not a magistrate,"" replied Monsieur d\'Albon, ""I should thinkthat woman was a witch.""As he said the words, the cow came to the iron gate and pushed her warmmuzzle towards them, as if she felt the need of seeing human beings.Then a woman, if that name could be applied to the indefinable being whosuddenly issued from a clump of bushes, pulled away the cow by its rope.This woman wore on her head a red handkerchief, beneath which trailedlong locks of hair in color and shape like the flax on a distaff. Shewore no fichu. A coarse woollen petticoat in black and gray stripes, tooshort by several inches, exposed her legs. She might have belonged tosome tribe of Red-Skins described by Cooper, for her legs, neck, andarms were the color of brick. No ray of intelligence enlivened hervacant face. A few whitish hairs served her for eyebrows; the eyesthemselves, of a dull blue, were cold and wan; and her mouth was soformed as to show the teeth, which were crooked, but as white as thoseof a dog.""Here, my good woman!"" called Monsieur de Sucy.She came very slowly to the gate, looking with a silly expression at thetwo huntsmen, the sight of whom brought a forced and painful smile toher face.""Where are we? Whose house is this? Who are you? Do you belong here?""To these questions and several others which the two friends alternatelyaddressed to her, she answered only with guttural sounds that seemedmore like the growl of an animal than the voice of a human being.""She must be deaf and dumb,"" said the marquis.""Bons-Hommes!"" cried the peasant woman.""Ah! I see. This is, no doubt, the old monastery of the Bons-Hommes,""said the marquis.He renewed his questions. But, like a capricious child, the peasantwoman colored, played with her wooden shoe, twisted the rope of thecow, which was now feeding peaceably, and looked at the two hunters,examining every part of their clothing; then she yelped, growled, andclucked, but did not speak.""What is your name?"" said Philippe, looking at her fixedly, as if hemeant to mesmerize her.""Genevieve,"" she said, laughing with a silly air.""The cow is the most intelligent being we have seen so far,"" said themarquis. ""I shall fire my gun and see if that will being some one.""Just as d\'Albon raised his gun, the colonel stopped him with a gesture,and pointed to the form of a woman, probably the one who had so keenlypiqued his curiosity. At this moment she seemed lost in the deepestmeditation, and was coming with slow steps along a distant pathway, sothat the two friends had ample time to examine her.She was dressed in a ragged gown of black satin. Her long hair fell inmasses of curls over her forehead, around her shoulders, and below herwaist, serving her for a shawl. Accustomed no doubt to this disorder,she seldom pushed her hair from her forehead; and when she did so, itwas with a sudden toss of her head which only for a moment cleared herforehead and eyes from the thick veil. Her gesture, like that of ananimal, had a remarkable mechanical precision, the quickness of whichseemed wonderful in a woman. The huntsmen were amazed to see hersuddenly leap up on the branch of an apple-tree, and sit there with theease of a bird. She gathered an apple and ate it; then she dropped tothe ground with the graceful ease we admire in a squirrel. Her limbspossessed an elasticity which took from every movement the slightestappearance of effort or constraint. She played upon the turf, rollingherself about like a child; then, suddenly, she flung her feet and handsforward, and lay at full length on the grass, with the grace and naturalease of a young cat asleep in the sun. Thunder sounded in the distance,and she turned suddenly, rising on her hands and knees with the rapidityof a dog which hears a coming footstep.The effects of this singular attitude was to separate into two heavymasses the volume of her black hair, which now fell on either side ofher head, and allowed the two spectators to admire the white shouldersglistening like daisies in a field, and the throat, the perfection ofwhich allowed them to judge of the other beauties of her figure.Suddenly she uttered a distressful cry and rose to her feet. Hermovements succeeded each other with such airiness and grace that sheseemed not a creature of this world but a daughter of the atmosphere, assung in the poems of Ossian. She ran toward a piece of water, shook oneof her legs lightly to cast off her shoe, and began to dabble her foot,white as alabaster, in the current, admiring, perhaps, the undulationsshe thus produced upon the surface of the water. Then she knelt down atthe edge of the stream and amused herself, like a child, in casting inher long tresses and pulling them abruptly out, to watch the shower ofdrops that glittered down, looking, as the sunlight struck athwart them,like a chaplet of pearls.""That woman is mad!"" cried the marquis.A hoarse cry, uttered by Genevieve, seemed uttered as a warning to theunknown woman, who turned suddenly, throwing back her hair from eitherside of her face. At this instant the colonel and Monsieur d\'Albon coulddistinctly see her features; she, herself, perceiving the two friends,sprang to the iron railing with the lightness and rapidity of a deer.""Adieu!"" she said, in a soft, harmonious voice, the melody of which didnot convey the slightest feeling or the slightest thought.Monsieur d\'Albon admired the long lashes of her eyelids, the blacknessof her eyebrows, and the dazzling whiteness of a skin devoid of even thefaintest tinge of color. Tiny blue veins alone broke the uniformity ofits pure white tones. When the marquis turned to his friend as if toshare with him his amazement at the sight of this singular creature, hefound him stretched on the ground as if dead. D\'Albon fired his gunin the air to summon assistance, crying out ""Help! help!"" and thenendeavored to revive the colonel. At the sound of the shot, the unknownwoman, who had hitherto stood motionless, fled away with the rapidityof an arrow, uttering cries of fear like a wounded animal, and runninghither and thither about the meadow with every sign of the greatestterror.Monsieur d\'Albon, hearing the rumbling of a carriage on the high-roadto Ile-Adam, waved his handkerchief and shouted to its occupants forassistance. The carriage was immediately driven up to the old monastery,and the marquis recognized his neighbors, Monsieur and Madame deGranville, who at once gave up their carriage to the service of thetwo gentlemen. Madame de Granville had with her, by chance, a bottle ofsalts, which revived the colonel for a moment. When he opened his eyeshe turned them to the meadow, where the unknown woman was still runningand uttering her distressing cries. A smothered exclamation escapedhim, which seemed to express a sense of horror; then he closed his eyesagain, and made a gesture as if to implore his friend to remove him fromthat sight.Monsieur and Madame de Granville placed their carriage entirely at thedisposal of the marquis, assuring him courteously that they would liketo continue their way on foot.""Who is that lady?"" asked the marquis, signing toward the unknown woman.""I believe she comes from Moulins,"" replied Monsieur de Granville. ""Sheis the Comtesse de Vandieres, and they say she is mad; but as shehas only been here two months I will not vouch for the truth of thesehearsays.""Monsieur d\'Albon thanked his friends, and placing the colonel in thecarriage, started with him for Cassan.""It is she!"" cried Philippe, recovering his senses.""Who is she?"" asked d\'Albon.""Stephanie. Ah, dead and living, living and mad! I fancied I was dying.""The prudent marquis, appreciating the gravity of the crisis throughwhich his friend was passing, was careful not to question or excite him;he was only anxious to reach the chateau, for the change which had takenplace in the colonel\'s features, in fact in his whole person, made himfear for his friend\'s reason. As soon, therefore, as the carriage hadreached the main street of Ile-Adam, he dispatched the footman to thevillage doctor, so that the colonel was no sooner fairly in his bed atthe chateau than the physician was beside him.""If monsieur had not been many hours without food the shock would havekilled him,"" said the doctor.After naming the first precautions, the doctor left the room, toprepare, himself, a calming potion. The next day, Monsieur de Sucy wasbetter, but the doctor still watched him carefully.""I will admit to you, monsieur le marquis,"" he said, ""that I have fearedsome affection of the brain. Monsieur de Sucy has received a violentshock; his passions are strong; but, in him, the first blow decides all.To-morrow he may be entirely out of danger.""The doctor was not mistaken; and the following day he allowed themarquis to see his friend.""My dear d\'Albon,"" said Philippe, pressing his hand, ""I am going to aska kindness of you. Go to the Bons-Hommes, and find out all you can ofthe lady we saw there; and return to me as quickly as you can; I shallcount the minutes.""Monsieur d\'Albon mounted his horse at once, and galloped to the oldabbey. When he arrived there, he saw before the iron gate a tall, spareman with a very kindly face, who answered in the affirmative when askedif he lived there. Monsieur d\'Albon then informed him of the reasons forhis visit.""What! monsieur,"" said the other, ""was it you who fired that fatal shot?You very nearly killed my poor patient.""""But, monsieur, I fired in the air.""""You would have done the countess less harm had you fired at her.""""Then we must not reproach each other, monsieur, for the sight of thecountess has almost killed my friend, Monsieur de Sucy.""""Heavens! can you mean Baron Philippe de Sucy?"" cried the doctor,clasping his hands. ""Did he go to Russia; was he at the passage of theBeresina?""""Yes,"" replied d\'Albon, ""he was captured by the Cossacks and kept forfive years in Siberia; he recovered his liberty a few months ago.""""Come in, monsieur,"" said the master of the house, leading the marquisinto a room on the lower floor where everything bore the marks ofcapricious destruction. The silken curtains beside the windows weretorn, while those of muslin remained intact.""You see,"" said the tall old man, as they entered, ""the ravagescommitted by that dear creature, to whom I devote myself. She is myniece; in spite of the impotence of my art, I hope some day torestore her reason by attempting a method which can only be employed,unfortunately, by very rich people.""Then, like all persons living in solitude who are afflicted with an everpresent and ever renewed grief, he related to the marquis at length thefollowing narrative, which is here condensed, and relieved of the manydigressions made by both the narrator and the listener.']"
80,3,Chapter 3,"['II. THE PASSAGE OF THE BERESINAMarechal Victor, when he started, about nine at night, from theheights of Studzianka, which he had defended, as the rear-guard of theretreating army, during the whole day of November 28th, 1812, left athousand men behind him, with orders to protect to the last possiblemoment whichever of the two bridges across the Beresina might stillexist. This rear-guard had devoted itself to the task of saving afrightful multitude of stragglers overcome by the cold, who obstinatelyrefused to leave the bivouacs of the army. The heroism of this generoustroop proved useless. The stragglers who flocked in masses to the banksof the Beresina found there, unhappily, an immense number of carriages,caissons, and articles of all kinds which the army had been forced toabandon when effecting its passage of the river on the 27th and 28th ofNovember. Heirs to such unlooked-for riches, the unfortunate men, stupidwith cold, took up their abode in the deserted bivouacs, broke up thematerial which they found there to build themselves cabins, made fuel ofeverything that came to hand, cut up the frozen carcasses of thehorses for food, tore the cloth and the curtains from the carriagesfor coverlets, and went to sleep, instead of continuing their wayand crossing quietly during the night that cruel Beresina, which anincredible fatality had already made so destructive to the army.The apathy of these poor soldiers can only be conceived by those whoremember to have crossed vast deserts of snow without other perspectivethan a snow horizon, without other drink than snow, without other bedthan snow, without other food than snow or a few frozen beet-roots, afew handfuls of flour, or a little horseflesh. Dying of hunger, thirst,fatigue, and want of sleep, these unfortunates reached a shore wherethey saw before them wood, provisions, innumerable camp equipages,and carriages,--in short a whole town at their service. The village ofStudzianka had been wholly taken to pieces and conveyed from the heightson which it stood to the plain. However forlorn and dangerous thatrefuge might be, its miseries and its perils only courted men who hadlately seen nothing before them but the awful deserts of Russia. It was,in fact, a vast asylum which had an existence of twenty-four hours only.Utter lassitude, and the sense of unexpected comfort, made that mass ofmen inaccessible to every thought but that of rest. Though theartillery of the left wing of the Russians kept up a steady fire on thismass,--visible like a stain now black, now flaming, in the midst of thetrackless snow,--this shot and shell seemed to the torpid creatures onlyone inconvenience the more. It was like a thunderstorm, despised by allbecause the lightning strikes so few; the balls struck only here andthere, the dying, the sick, the dead sometimes! Stragglers arrived ingroups continually; but once here those perambulating corpses separated;each begged for himself a place near a fire; repulsed repeatedly, theymet again, to obtain by force the hospitality already refused to them.Deaf to the voice of some of their officers, who warned them of probabledestruction on the morrow, they spent the amount of courage necessary tocross the river in building that asylum of a night, in making one mealthat they themselves doomed to be their last. The death that awaitedthem they considered no evil, provided they could have that one night\'ssleep. They thought nothing evil but hunger, thirst, and cold. Whenthere was no more wood or food or fire, horrible struggles took placebetween fresh-comers and the rich who possessed a shelter. The weakestsuccumbed.At last there came a moment when a number, pursued by the Russians,found only snow on which to bivouac, and these lay down to rise no more.Insensibly this mass of almost annihilated beings became so compact, sodeaf, so torpid, so happy perhaps, that Marechal Victor, who hadbeen their heroic defender by holding twenty thousand Russians underWittgenstein at bay, was forced to open a passage by main force throughthis forest of men in order to cross the Beresina with five thousandgallant fellows whom he was taking to the emperor. The unfortunatemalingerers allowed themselves to be crushed rather than stir; theyperished in silence, smiling at their extinguished fires, without athought of France.It was not until ten o\'clock that night that Marechal Victor reached thebank of the river. Before crossing the bridge which led to Zembin, heconfided the fate of his own rear-guard now left in Studzianka to Eble,the savior of all those who survived the calamities of the Beresina.It was towards midnight when this great general, followed by one braveofficer, left the cabin he occupied near the bridge, and studied thespectacle of that improvised camp placed between the bank of the riverand Studzianka. The Russian cannon had ceased to thunder. Innumerablefires, which, amid that trackless waste of snow, burned pale andscarcely sent out any gleams, illumined here and there by sudden flashesforms and faces that were barely human. Thirty thousand poor wretches,belonging to all nations, from whom Napoleon had recruited his Russianarmy, were trifling away their lives with brutish indifference.""Let us save them!"" said General Eble to the officer who accompaniedhim. ""To-morrow morning the Russians will be masters of Studzianka. Wemust burn the bridge the moment they appear. Therefore, my friend, takeyour courage in your hand! Go to the heights. Tell General Fournierhe has barely time to evacuate his position, force a way through thiscrowd, and cross the bridge. When you have seen him in motion followhim. Find men you can trust, and the moment Fournier had crossedthe bridge, burn, without pity, huts, equipages, caissons,carriages,--EVERYTHING! Drive that mass of men to the bridge. Compel allthat has two legs to get to the other side of the river. The burning ofeverything--EVERYTHING--is now our last resource. If Berthier had letme destroy those damned camp equipages, this river would swallow onlymy poor pontoniers, those fifty heroes who will save the army, but whothemselves will be forgotten.""The general laid his hand on his forehead and was silent. He felt thatPoland would be his grave, and that no voice would rise to do justiceto those noble men who stood in the water, the icy water of Beresina, todestroy the buttresses of the bridges. One alone of those heroes stilllives--or, to speak more correctly, suffers--in a village, totallyignored.The aide-de-camp started. Hardly had this generous officer gone ahundred yards towards Studzianka than General Eble wakened a numberof his weary pontoniers, and began the work,--the charitable work ofburning the bivouacs set up about the bridge, and forcing the sleepers,thus dislodged, to cross the river.Meanwhile the young aide-de-camp reached, not without difficulty, theonly wooden house still left standing in Studzianka.""This barrack seems pretty full, comrade,"" he said to a man whom he sawby the doorway.""If you can get in you\'ll be a clever trooper,"" replied the officer,without turning his head or ceasing to slice off with his sabre the barkof the logs of which the house was built.""Is that you, Philippe?"" said the aide-de-camp, recognizing a friend bythe tones of his voice.""Yes. Ha, ha! is it you, old fellow?"" replied Monsieur de Sucy, lookingat the aide-de-camp, who, like himself, was only twenty-three years ofage. ""I thought you were the other side of that cursed river. What areyou here for? Have you brought cakes and wine for our dessert? You\'ll bewelcome,"" and he went on slicing off the bark, which he gave as a sortof provender to his horse.""I am looking for your commander to tell him, from General Eble, to makefor Zembin. You\'ll have barely enough time to get through that crowd ofmen below. I am going presently to set fire to their camp and force themto march.""""You warm me up--almost! That news makes me perspire. I have two friendsI MUST save. Ah! without those two to cling to me, I should be deadalready. It is for them that I feed my horse and don\'t eat myself. Haveyou any food,--a mere crust? It is thirty hours since anything has goneinto my stomach, and yet I have fought like a madman--just to keep alittle warmth and courage in me.""""Poor Philippe, I have nothing--nothing! But where\'s your general,--inthis house?""""No, don\'t go there; the place is full of wounded. Go up the street;you\'ll find on your left a sort of pig-pen; the general is there.Good-bye, old fellow. If we ever dance a trenis on a Paris floor--""He did not end his sentence; the north wind blew at that moment withsuch ferocity that the aide-de-camp hurried on to escape being frozen,and the lips of Major de Sucy stiffened. Silence reigned, broken onlyby the moans which came from the house, and the dull sound made by themajor\'s horse as it chewed in a fury of hunger the icy bark of the treeswith which the house was built. Monsieur de Sucy replaced his sabre inits scabbard, took the bridle of the precious horse he had hitherto beenable to preserve, and led it, in spite of the animal\'s resistance, fromthe wretched fodder it appeared to think excellent.""We\'ll start, Bichette, we\'ll start! There\'s none but you, my beauty,who can save Stephanie. Ha! by and bye you and I may be able torest--and die,"" he added.Philippe, wrapped in a fur pelisse, to which he owed his preservationand his energy, began to run, striking his feet hard upon the frozensnow to keep them warm. Scarcely had he gone a few hundred yards fromthe village than he saw a blaze in the direction of the place where,since morning, he had left his carriage in charge of his former orderly,an old soldier. Horrible anxiety laid hold of him. Like all others whowere controlled during this fatal retreat by some powerful sentiment, hefound a strength to save his friends which he could not have put forthto save himself.Presently he reached a slight declivity at the foot of which, in aspot sheltered from the enemy\'s balls, he had stationed the carriage,containing a young woman, the companion of his childhood, the being mostdear to him on earth. At a few steps distant from the vehicle he nowfound a company of some thirty stragglers collected around an immensefire, which they were feeding with planks, caisson covers, wheels, andbroken carriages. These soldiers were, no doubt, the last comers of thatcrowd who, from the base of the hill of Studzianka to the fatal river,formed an ocean of heads intermingled with fires and huts,--a livingsea, swayed by motions that were almost imperceptible, and giving fortha murmuring sound that rose at times to frightful outbursts. Driven byfamine and despair, these poor wretches must have rifled the carriagebefore de Sucy reached it. The old general and his young wife, whom hehad left lying in piles of clothes and wrapped in mantles and pelisses,were now on the snow, crouching before the fire. One door of thecarriage was already torn off.No sooner did the men about the fire hear the tread of the major\'s horsethan a hoarse cry, the cry of famine, arose,--""A horse! a horse!""Those voices formed but one voice.""Back! back! look out for yourself!"" cried two or three soldiers, aimingat the mare. Philippe threw himself before his animal, crying out,--""You villains! I\'ll throw you into your own fire. There are plenty ofdead horses up there. Go and fetch them.""""Isn\'t he a joker, that officer! One, two--get out of the way,"" cried acolossal grenadier. ""No, you won\'t, hey! Well, as you please, then.""A woman\'s cry rose higher than the report of the musket. Philippefortunately was not touched, but Bichette, mortally wounded, wasstruggling in the throes of death. Three men darted forward anddispatched her with their bayonets.""Cannibals!"" cried Philippe, ""let me at any rate take the horse-clothand my pistols.""""Pistols, yes,"" replied the grenadier. ""But as for that horse-cloth, no!here\'s a poor fellow afoot, with nothing in his stomach for two days,and shivering in his rags. It is our general.""Philippe kept silence as he looked at the man, whose boots were wornout, his trousers torn in a dozen places, while nothing but a raggedfatigue-cap covered with ice was on his head. He hastened, however, totake his pistols. Five men dragged the mare to the fire, and cut herup with the dexterity of a Parisian butcher. The pieces were instantlyseized and flung upon the embers.The major went up to the young woman, who had uttered a cry onrecognizing him. He found her motionless, seated on a cushion beside thefire. She looked at him silently, without smiling. Philippe then sawthe soldier to whom he had confided the carriage; the man was wounded.Overcome by numbers, he had been forced to yield to the malingerers whoattacked him; and, like the dog who defended to the last possible momenthis master\'s dinner, he had taken his share of the booty, and was nowsitting beside the fire, wrapped in a white sheet by way of cloak, andturning carefully on the embers a slice of the mare. Philippe saw uponhis face the joy these preparations gave him. The Comte de Vandieres,who, for the last few days, had fallen into a state of second childhood,was seated on a cushion beside his wife, looking fixedly at the fire,which was beginning to thaw his torpid limbs. He had shown no emotionof any kind, either at Philippe\'s danger, or at the fight which ended inthe pillage of the carriage and their expulsion from it.At first de Sucy took the hand of the young countess, as if to show herhis affection, and the grief he felt at seeing her reduced to such uttermisery; then he grew silent; seated beside her on a heap of snow whichwas turning into a rivulet as it melted, he yielded himself up to thehappiness of being warm, forgetting their peril, forgetting all things.His face assumed, in spite of himself, an expression of almost stupidjoy, and he waited with impatience until the fragment of the mare givento his orderly was cooked. The smell of the roasting flesh increased hishunger, and his hunger silenced his heart, his courage, and his love.He looked, without anger, at the results of the pillage of his carriage.All the men seated around the fire had shared his blankets, cushions,pelisses, robes, also the clothing of the Comte and Comtesse deVandieres and his own. Philippe looked about him to see if there wasanything left in or near the vehicle that was worth saving. By the lightof the flames he saw gold and diamonds and plate scattered everywhere,no one having thought it worth his while to take any.Each of the individuals collected by chance around this fire maintaineda silence that was almost horrible, and did nothing but what he judgednecessary for his own welfare. Their misery was even grotesque. Faces,discolored by cold, were covered with a layer of mud, on which tears hadmade a furrow from the eyes to the beard, showing the thickness of thatmiry mask. The filth of their long beards made these men still morerepulsive. Some were wrapped in the countess\'s shawls, others wore thetrappings of horses and muddy saddlecloths, or masses of rags from whichthe hoar-frost hung; some had a boot on one leg and a shoe on the other;in fact, there were none whose costume did not present some laughablesingularity. But in presence of such amusing sights the men themselveswere grave and gloomy. The silence was broken only by the snapping ofthe wood, the crackling of the flames, the distant murmur of the camps,and the blows of the sabre given to what remained of Bichette in searchof her tenderest morsels. A few miserable creatures, perhaps more wearythan the rest, were sleeping; when one of their number rolled into thefire no one attempted to help him out. These stern logicians argued thatif he were not dead his burns would warn him to find a safer place. Ifthe poor wretch waked in the flames and perished, no one cared. Two orthree soldiers looked at each other to justify their own indifference bythat of others. Twice this scene had taken place before the eyes of thecountess, who said nothing. When the various pieces of Bichette, placedhere and there upon the embers, were sufficiently broiled, each mansatisfied his hunger with the gluttony that disgusts us when we see itin animals.""This is the first time I ever saw thirty infantrymen on one horse,""cried the grenadier who had shot the mare.It was the only jest made that night which proved the nationalcharacter.Soon the great number of these poor soldiers wrapped themselves in whatthey could find and lay down on planks, or whatever would keep them fromcontact with the snow, and slept, heedless of the morrow. When the majorwas warm, and his hunger appeased, an invincible desire to sleep weigheddown his eyelids. During the short moment of his struggle against thatdesire he looked at the young woman, who had turned her face to thefire and was now asleep, leaving her closed eyes and a portion of herforehead exposed to sight. She was wrapped in a furred pelisse and aheavy dragoon\'s cloak; her head rested on a pillow stained with blood;an astrakhan hood, kept in place by a handkerchief knotted round herneck, preserved her face from the cold as much as possible. Her feetwere wrapped in the cloak. Thus rolled into a bundle, as it were, shelooked like nothing at all. Was she the last of the ""vivandieres""?Was she a charming woman, the glory of a lover, the queen of Parisiansalons? Alas! even the eye of her most devoted friend could trace nosign of anything feminine in that mass of rags and tatters. Love hadsuccumbed to cold in the heart of a woman!Through the thick veils of irresistible sleep, the major soon saw thehusband and wife as mere points or formless objects. The flames of thefire, those outstretched figures, the relentless cold, waiting, notthree feet distant from that fugitive heat, became all a dream. Oneimportunate thought terrified Philippe:""If I sleep, we shall all die; I will not sleep,"" he said to himself.And yet he slept.A terrible clamor and an explosion awoke him an hour later. The senseof his duty, the peril of his friend, fell suddenly on his heart. Heuttered a cry that was like a roar. He and his orderly were alone afoot.A sea of fire lay before them in the darkness of the night, licking upthe cabins and the bivouacs; cries of despair, howls, and imprecationsreached their ears; they saw against the flames thousands of humanbeings with agonized or furious faces. In the midst of that hell, acolumn of soldiers was forcing its way to the bridge, between two hedgesof dead bodies.""It is the retreat of the rear-guard!"" cried the major. ""All hope isgone!""""I have saved your carriage, Philippe,"" said a friendly voice.Turning round, de Sucy recognized the young aide-de-camp in the flaringof the flames.""Ah! all is lost!"" replied the major, ""they have eaten my horse; and howcan I make this stupid general and his wife walk?""""Take a brand from the fire and threaten them.""""Threaten the countess!""""Good-bye,"" said the aide-de-camp, ""I have scarcely time to get acrossthat fatal river--and I MUST; I have a mother in France. What a night!These poor wretches prefer to lie here in the snow; half will allowthemselves to perish in those flames rather than rise and move on. It isfour o\'clock, Philippe! In two hours the Russians will begin to move.I assure you you will again see the Beresina choked with corpses.Philippe! think of yourself! You have no horses, you cannot carry thecountess in your arms. Come--come with me!"" he said urgently, pulling deSucy by the arm.""My friend! abandon Stephanie!""De Sucy seized the countess, made her stand upright, shook her with theroughness of a despairing man, and compelled her to wake up. She lookedat him with fixed, dead eyes.""You must walk, Stephanie, or we shall all die here.""For all answer the countess tried to drop again upon the snow and sleep.The aide-de-camp seized a brand from the fire and waved it in her face.""We will save her in spite of herself!"" cried Philippe, lifting thecountess and placing her in the carriage.He returned to implore the help of his friend. Together they lifted theold general, without knowing whether he were dead or alive, and put himbeside his wife. The major then rolled over the men who were sleepingon his blankets, which he tossed into the carriage, together with someroasted fragments of his mare.""What do you mean to do?"" asked the aide-de-camp.""Drag them.""""You are crazy.""""True,"" said Philippe, crossing his arms in despair.Suddenly, he was seized by a last despairing thought.""To you,"" he said, grasping the sound arm of his orderly, ""I confideher for one hour. Remember that you must die sooner than let any oneapproach her.""The major then snatched up the countess\'s diamonds, held them in onehand, drew his sabre with the other, and began to strike with the flatof its blade such of the sleepers as he thought the most intrepid. Hesucceeded in awaking the colossal grenadier, and two other men whoserank it was impossible to tell.""We are done for!"" he said.""I know it,"" said the grenadier, ""but I don\'t care.""""Well, death for death, wouldn\'t you rather sell your life for a prettywoman, and take your chances of seeing France?""""I\'d rather sleep,"" said a man, rolling over on the snow, ""and if youtrouble me again, I\'ll stick my bayonet into your stomach.""""What is the business, my colonel?"" said the grenadier. ""That man isdrunk; he\'s a Parisian; he likes his ease.""""That is yours, my brave grenadier,"" cried the major, offering him astring of diamonds, ""if you will follow me and fight like a madman.The Russians are ten minutes\' march from here; they have horses; we aregoing up to their first battery for a pair.""""But the sentinels?""""One of us three--"" he interrupted himself, and turned to theaide-de-camp. ""You will come, Hippolyte, won\'t you?""Hippolyte nodded.""One of us,"" continued the major, ""will take care of the sentinel.Besides, perhaps they are asleep too, those cursed Russians.""""Forward! major, you\'re a brave one! But you\'ll give me a lift on yourcarriage?"" said the grenadier.""Yes, if you don\'t leave your skin up there--If I fall, Hippolyte, andyou, grenadier, promise me to do your utmost to save the countess.""""Agreed!"" cried the grenadier.They started for the Russian lines, toward one of the batteries whichhad so decimated the hapless wretches lying on the banks of the river.A few moments later, the gallop of two horses echoed over the snow, andthe wakened artillery men poured out a volley which ranged above theheads of the sleeping men. The pace of the horses was so fleet thattheir steps resounded like the blows of a blacksmith on his anvil. Thegenerous aide-de-camp was killed. The athletic grenadier was safe andsound. Philippe in defending Hippolyte had received a bayonet in hisshoulder; but he clung to his horse\'s mane, and clasped him so tightlywith his knees that the animal was held as in a vice.""God be praised!"" cried the major, finding his orderly untouched, andthe carriage in its place.""If you are just, my officer, you will get me the cross for this,"" saidthe man. ""We\'ve played a fine game of guns and sabres here, I can tellyou.""""We have done nothing yet--Harness the horses. Take these ropes.""""They are not long enough.""""Grenadier, turn over those sleepers, and take their shawls and linen,to eke out.""""Tiens! that\'s one dead,"" said the grenadier, stripping the first man hecame to. ""Bless me! what a joke, they are all dead!""""All?""""Yes, all; seems as if horse-meat must be indigestible if eaten withsnow.""The words made Philippe tremble. The cold was increasing.""My God! to lose the woman I have saved a dozen times!""The major shook the countess.""Stephanie! Stephanie!""The young woman opened her eyes.""Madame! we are saved.""""Saved!"" she repeated, sinking down again.The horses were harnessed as best they could. The major, holding hissabre in his well hand, with his pistols in his belt, gathered up thereins with the other hand and mounted one horse while the grenadiermounted the other. The orderly, whose feet were frozen, was throwninside the carriage, across the general and the countess. Excited bypricks from a sabre, the horses drew the carriage rapidly, with a sortof fury, to the plain, where innumerable obstacles awaited it. It wasimpossible to force a way without danger of crushing the sleeping men,women, and even children, who refused to move when the grenadier awokethem. In vain did Monsieur de Sucy endeavor to find the swathe cutby the rear-guard through the mass of human beings; it was alreadyobliterated, like the wake of a vessel through the sea. They could onlycreep along, being often stopped by soldiers who threatened to killtheir horses.""Do you want to reach the bridge?"" said the grenadier.""At the cost of my life--at the cost of the whole world!""""Then forward, march! you can\'t make omelets without breaking eggs.""And the grenadier of the guard urged the horses over men and bivouacswith bloody wheels and a double line of corpses on either side of them.We must do him the justice to say that he never spared his breath inshouting in stentorian tones,--""Look out there, carrion!""""Poor wretches!"" cried the major.""Pooh! that or the cold, that or the cannon,"" said the grenadier,prodding the horses, and urging them on.A catastrophe, which might well have happened to them much sooner, put astop to their advance. The carriage was overturned.""I expected it,"" cried the imperturbable grenadier. ""Ho! ho! your man isdead.""""Poor Laurent!"" said the major.""Laurent? Was he in the 5th chasseurs?""""Yes.""""Then he was my cousin. Oh, well, this dog\'s life isn\'t happy enough towaste any joy in grieving for him.""The carriage could not be raised; the horses were taken out with seriousand, as it proved, irreparable loss of time. The shock of the overturnwas so violent that the young countess, roused from her lethargy, threwoff her coverings and rose.""Philippe, where are we?"" she cried in a gentle voice, looking abouther.""Only five hundred feet from the bridge. We are now going to cross theBeresina, Stephanie, and once across I will not torment you any more;you shall sleep; we shall be in safety, and can reach Wilna easily.--Godgrant that she may never know what her life has cost!"" he thought.""Philippe! you are wounded!""""That is nothing.""Too late! the fatal hour had come. The Russian cannon sounded thereveille. Masters of Studzianka, they could sweep the plain, and bydaylight the major could see two of their columns moving and formingon the heights. A cry of alarm arose from the multitude, who startedto their feet in an instant. Every man now understood his dangerinstinctively, and the whole mass rushed to gain the bridge with themotion of a wave.The Russians came down with the rapidity of a conflagration. Men, women,children, horses,--all rushed tumultuously to the bridge. Fortunatelythe major, who was carrying the countess, was still some distance fromit. General Eble had just set fire to the supports on the other bank. Inspite of the warnings shouted to those who were rushing upon the bridge,not a soul went back. Not only did the bridge go down crowded with humanbeings, but the impetuosity of that flood of men toward the fatal bankwas so furious that a mass of humanity poured itself violently into theriver like an avalanche. Not a cry was heard; the only sound was likethe dropping of monstrous stones into the water. Then the Beresina was amass of floating corpses.The retrograde movement of those who now fell back into the plainto escape the death before them was so violent, and their concussionagainst those who were advancing from the rear so terrible, that numberswere smothered or trampled to death. The Comte and Comtesse de Vandieresowed their lives to their carriage, behind which Philippe forced them,using it as a breastwork. As for the major and the grenadier, they foundtheir safety in their strength. They killed to escape being killed.This hurricane of human beings, the flux and reflux of living bodies,had the effect of leaving for a few short moments the whole bank of theBeresina deserted. The multitude were surging to the plain. If a few menrushed to the river, it was less in the hope of reaching the other bank,which to them was France, than to rush from the horrors of Siberia.Despair proved an aegis to some bold hearts. One officer sprangfrom ice-cake to ice-cake, and reached the opposite shore. A soldierclambered miraculously over mounds of dead bodies and heaps of ice. Themultitude finally comprehended that the Russians would not put to deatha body of twenty thousand men, without arms, torpid, stupid, unableto defend themselves; and each man awaited his fate with horribleresignation. Then the major and the grenadier, the general and his wife,remained almost alone on the river bank, a few steps from the spot wherethe bridge had been. They stood there, with dry eyes, silent, surroundedby heaps of dead. A few sound soldiers, a few officers to whom theemergency had restored their natural energy, were near them. This groupconsisted of some fifty men in all. The major noticed at a distanceof some two hundred yards the remains of another bridge intended forcarriages and destroyed the day before.""Let us make a raft!"" he cried.He had hardly uttered the words before the whole group rushed to theruins, and began to pick up iron bolts, and screws, and pieces of woodand ropes, whatever materials they could find that were suitable forthe construction of a raft. A score of soldiers and officers, who werearmed, formed a guard, commanded by the major, to protect the workersagainst the desperate attacks which might be expected from the crowd,if their scheme was discovered. The instinct of freedom, strong in allprisoners, inspiring them to miraculous acts, can only be compared withthat which now drove to action these unfortunate Frenchmen.""The Russians! the Russians are coming!"" cried the defenders to theworkers; and the work went on, the raft increased in length and breadthand depth. Generals, soldiers, colonel, all put their shoulders to thewheel; it was a true image of the building of Noah\'s ark. The youngcountess, seated beside her husband, watched the progress of the workwith regret that she could not help it; and yet she did assist in makingknots to secure the cordage.At last the raft was finished. Forty men launched it on the river, adozen others holding the cords which moored it to the shore. But nosooner had the builders seen their handiwork afloat, than they sprangfrom the bank with odious selfishness. The major, fearing the fury ofthis first rush, held back the countess and the general, but too latehe saw the whole raft covered, men pressing together like crowds at atheatre.""Savages!"" he cried, ""it was I who gave you the idea of that raft. Ihave saved you, and you deny me a place.""A confused murmur answered him. The men at the edge of the raft, armedwith long sticks, pressed with violence against the shore to send offthe frail construction with sufficient impetus to force its way throughcorpses and ice-floes to the other shore.""Thunder of heaven! I\'ll sweep you into the water if you don\'t take themajor and his two companions,"" cried the stalwart grenadier, who swunghis sabre, stopped the departure, and forced the men to stand closer inspite of furious outcries.""I shall fall,""--""I am falling,""--""Push off! push off!--Forward!""resounded on all sides.The major looked with haggard eyes at Stephanie, who lifted hers toheaven with a feeling of sublime resignation.""To die with thee!"" she said.There was something even comical in the position of the men inpossession of the raft. Though they were uttering awful groans andimprecations, they dared not resist the grenadier, for in truth theywere so closely packed together, that a push to one man might send halfof them overboard. This danger was so pressing that a cavalry captainendeavored to get rid of the grenadier; but the latter, seeing thehostile movement of the officer, seized him round the waist and flunghim into the water, crying out,--""Ha! ha! my duck, do you want to drink? Well, then, drink!--Here aretwo places,"" he cried. ""Come, major, toss me the little woman and followyourself. Leave that old fossil, who\'ll be dead by to-morrow.""""Make haste!"" cried the voice of all, as one man.""Come, major, they are grumbling, and they have a right to do so.""The Comte de Vandieres threw off his wrappings and showed himself in hisgeneral\'s uniform.""Let us save the count,"" said Philippe.Stephanie pressed his hand, and throwing herself on his breast, sheclasped him tightly.""Adieu!"" she said.They had understood each other.The Comte de Vandieres recovered sufficient strength and presence ofmind to spring upon the raft, whither Stephanie followed him, afterturning a last look to Philippe.""Major! will you take my place? I don\'t care a fig for life,"" cried thegrenadier. ""I\'ve neither wife nor child nor mother.""""I confide them to your care,"" said the major, pointing to the count andhis wife.""Then be easy; I\'ll care for them, as though they were my very eyes.""The raft was now sent off with so much violence toward the opposite sideof the river, that as it touched ground, the shock was felt by all. Thecount, who was at the edge of it, lost his balance and fell into theriver; as he fell, a cake of sharp ice caught him, and cut off his head,flinging it to a great distance.""See there! major!"" cried the grenadier.""Adieu!"" said a woman\'s voice.Philippe de Sucy fell to the ground, overcome with horror and fatigue.']"
80,4,Chapter 4,"['III. THE CURE""My poor niece became insane,"" continued the physician, after a fewmoment\'s silence. ""Ah! monsieur,"" he said, seizing the marquis\'s hand,""life has been awful indeed for that poor little woman, so young,so delicate! After being, by dreadful fatality, separated from thegrenadier, whose name was Fleuriot, she was dragged about for two yearsat the heels of the army, the plaything of a crowd of wretches. Shewas often, they tell me, barefooted, and scarcely clothed; for monthstogether, she had no care, no food but what she could pick up; sometimeskept in hospitals, sometimes driven away like an animal, God alone knowsthe horrors that poor unfortunate creature has survived. She waslocked up in a madhouse, in a little town in Germany, at the timeher relatives, thinking her dead, divided her property. In 1816, thegrenadier Fleuriot was at an inn in Strasburg, where she went aftermaking her escape from the madhouse. Several peasants told the grenadierthat she had lived for a whole month in the forest, where they hadtracked her in vain, trying to catch her, but she had always escapedthem. I was then staying a few miles from Strasburg. Hearing much talkof a wild woman caught in the woods, I felt a desire to ascertain thetruth of the ridiculous stories which were current about her. What weremy feelings on beholding my own niece! Fleuriot told me all he knew ofher dreadful history. I took the poor man with my niece back to my homein Auvergne, where, unfortunately, I lost him some months later. He hadsome slight control over Madame de Vandieres; he alone could induce herto wear clothing. \'Adieu,\' that word, which is her only language, sheseldom uttered at that time. Fleuriot had endeavored to awaken in her afew ideas, a few memories of the past; but he failed; all that he gainedwas to make her say that melancholy word a little oftener. Still, thegrenadier knew how to amuse her and play with her; my hope was in him,but--""He was silent for a moment.""Here,"" he continued, ""she has found another creature, with whomshe seems to have some strange understanding. It is a poor idioticpeasant-girl, who, in spite of her ugliness and stupidity, loved a man,a mason. The mason was willing to marry her, as she had some property.Poor Genevieve was happy for a year; she dressed in her best to dancewith her lover on Sunday; she comprehended love; in her heart and soulthere was room for that one sentiment. But the mason, Dallot, reflected.He found a girl with all her senses, and more land than Genevieve,and he deserted the poor creature. Since then she has lost the littleintellect that love developed in her; she can do nothing but watch thecows, or help at harvesting. My niece and this poor girl are friends,apparently by some invisible chain of their common destiny, bythe sentiment in each which has caused their madness. See!"" addedStephanie\'s uncle, leading the marquis to a window.The latter then saw the countess seated on the ground betweenGenevieve\'s legs. The peasant-girl, armed with a huge horn comb, wasgiving her whole attention to the work of disentangling the long blackhair of the poor countess, who was uttering little stifled cries,expressive of some instinctive sense of pleasure. Monsieur d\'Albonshuddered as he saw the utter abandonment of the body, the carelessanimal ease which revealed in the hapless woman a total absence of soul.""Philippe, Philippe!"" he muttered, ""the past horrors are nothing!--Isthere no hope?"" he asked.The old physician raised his eyes to heaven.""Adieu, monsieur,"" said the marquis, pressing his hand. ""My friend isexpecting me. He will soon come to you.""""Then it was really she!"" cried de Sucy at d\'Albon\'s first words. ""Ah!I still doubted it,"" he added, a few tears falling from his eyes, whichwere habitually stern.""Yes, it is the Comtesse de Vandieres,"" replied the marquis.The colonel rose abruptly from his bed and began to dress.""Philippe!"" cried his friend, ""are you mad?""""I am no longer ill,"" replied the colonel, simply. ""This news hasquieted my suffering. What pain can I feel when I think of Stephanie? Iam going to the Bons-Hommes, to see her, speak to her, cure her. She isfree. Well, happiness will smile upon us--or Providence is not inthis world. Think you that that poor woman could hear my voice and notrecover reason?""""She has already seen you and not recognized you,"" said his friend,gently, for he felt the danger of Philippe\'s excited hopes, and tried tocast a salutary doubt upon them.The colonel quivered; then he smiled, and made a motion of incredulity.No one dared to oppose his wish, and within a very short time he reachedthe old priory.""Where is she?"" he cried, on arriving.""Hush!"" said her uncle, ""she is sleeping. See, here she is.""Philippe then saw the poor insane creature lying on a bench in the sun.Her head was protected from the heat by a forest of hair which fell intangled locks over her face. Her arms hung gracefully to the ground; herbody lay easily posed like that of a doe; her feet were folded under herwithout effort; her bosom rose and fell at regular intervals; her skin,her complexion, had that porcelain whiteness, which we admire so much inthe clear transparent faces of children. Standing motionless besideher, Genevieve held in her hand a branch which Stephanie had doubtlessclimbed a tall poplar to obtain, and the poor idiot was gently wavingit above her sleeping companion, to chase away the flies and cool theatmosphere.The peasant-woman gazed at Monsieur Fanjat and the colonel; then, likean animal which recognizes its master, she turned her head slowly tothe countess, and continued to watch her, without giving any signof surprise or intelligence. The air was stifling; the stone benchglittered in the sunlight; the meadow exhaled to heaven those impishvapors which dance and dart above the herbage like silvery dust; butGenevieve seemed not to feel this all-consuming heat.The colonel pressed the hand of the doctor violently in his own. Tearsrolled from his eyes along his manly cheeks, and fell to the earth atthe feet of his Stephanie.""Monsieur,"" said the uncle, ""for two years past, my heart is broken dayby day. Soon you will be like me. You may not always weep, but you willalways feel your sorrow.""The two men understood each other; and again, pressing each other\'shands, they remained motionless, contemplating the exquisite calmnesswhich sleep had cast upon that graceful creature. From time to timeshe gave a sigh, and that sigh, which had all the semblance ofsensibilities, made the unhappy colonel tremble with hope.""Alas!"" said Monsieur Fanjat, ""do not deceive yourself, monsieur; thereis no meaning in her sigh.""Those who have ever watched for hours with delight the sleep of onewho is tenderly beloved, whose eyes will smile to them at waking, canunderstand the sweet yet terrible emotion that shook the colonel\'s soul.To him, this sleep was an illusion; the waking might be death, death inits most awful form. Suddenly, a little goat jumped in three bounds tothe bench, and smelt at Stephanie, who waked at the sound. She sprang toher feet, but so lightly that the movement did not frighten the freakishanimal; then she caught sight of Philippe, and darted away, followed byher four-footed friend, to a hedge of elders; there she uttered the samelittle cry like a frightened bird, which the two men had heard near theother gate. Then she climbed an acacia, and nestling into its tuftedtop, she watched the stranger with the inquisitive attention of theforest birds.""Adieu, adieu, adieu,"" she said, without the soul communicating onesingle intelligent inflexion to the word.It was uttered impassively, as the bird sings his note.""She does not recognize me!"" cried the colonel, in despair. ""Stephanie!it is Philippe, thy Philippe, PHILIPPE!""And the poor soldier went to the acacia; but when he was a few stepsfrom it, the countess looked at him, as if defying him, although aslight expression of fear seemed to flicker in her eye; then, with asingle bound she sprang from the acacia to a laburnum, and thence to aNorway fir, where she darted from branch to branch with extraordinaryagility.""Do not pursue her,"" said Monsieur Fanjat to the colonel, ""or you willarouse an aversion which might become insurmountable. I will help you totame her and make her come to you. Let us sit on this bench. If you payno attention to her, she will come of her own accord to examine you.""""SHE! not to know me! to flee me!"" repeated the colonel, seating himselfon a bench with his back to a tree that shaded it, and letting his headfall upon his breast.The doctor said nothing. Presently, the countess came gently down thefir-tree, letting herself swing easily on the branches, as the windswayed them. At each branch she stopped to examine the stranger; butseeing him motionless, she at last sprang to the ground and came slowlytowards him across the grass. When she reached a tree about ten feetdistant, against which she leaned, Monsieur Fanjat said to the colonelin a low voice,--""Take out, adroitly, from my right hand pocket some lumps of sugaryou will feel there. Show them to her, and she will come to us. I willrenounce in your favor my sole means of giving her pleasure. With sugar,which she passionately loves, you will accustom her to approach you, andto know you again.""""When she was a woman,"" said Philippe, sadly, ""she had no taste forsweet things.""When the colonel showed her the lump of sugar, holding it between thethumb and forefinger of his right hand, she again uttered her littlewild cry, and sprang toward him; then she stopped, struggling againstthe instinctive fear he caused her; she looked at the sugar and turnedaway her head alternately, precisely like a dog whose master forbids himto touch his food until he has said a letter of the alphabet which heslowly repeats. At last the animal desire triumphed over fear. Stephaniedarted to Philippe, cautiously putting out her little brown hand toseize the prize, touched the fingers of her poor lover as she snatchedthe sugar, and fled away among the trees. This dreadful scene overcamethe colonel; he burst into tears and rushed into the house.""Has love less courage than friendship?"" Monsieur Fanjat said to him.""I have some hope, Monsieur le baron. My poor niece was in a far worsestate than that in which you now find her.""""How was that possible?"" cried Philippe.""She went naked,"" replied the doctor.The colonel made a gesture of horror and turned pale. The doctor saw inthat sudden pallor alarming symptoms; he felt the colonel\'s pulse, foundhim in a violent fever, and half persuaded, half compelled him to go tobed. Then he gave him a dose of opium to ensure a calm sleep.Eight days elapsed, during which Colonel de Sucy struggled againstmortal agony; tears no longer came to his eyes. His soul, oftenlacerated, could not harden itself to the sight of Stephanie\'s insanity;but he covenanted, so to speak, with his cruel situation, and found someassuaging of his sorrow. He had the courage to slowly tame the countessby bringing her sweetmeats; he took such pains in choosing them, and helearned so well how to keep the little conquests he sought to make uponher instincts--that last shred of her intellect--that he ended by makingher much TAMER than she had ever been.Every morning he went into the park, and if, after searching for herlong, he could not discover on what tree she was swaying, nor the covertin which she crouched to play with a bird, nor the roof on which shemight have clambered, he would whistle the well-known air of ""Partantpour la Syrie,"" to which some tender memory of their love attached.Instantly, Stephanie would run to him with the lightness of a fawn. Shewas now so accustomed to see him, that he frightened her no longer. Soonshe was willing to sit upon his knee, and clasp him closely with herthin and agile arm. In that attitude--so dear to lovers!--Philippe wouldfeed her with sugarplums. Then, having eaten those that he gave her, shewould often search his pockets with gestures that had all the mechanicalvelocity of a monkey\'s motions. When she was very sure there was nothingmore, she looked at Philippe with clear eyes, without ideas, withrecognition. Then she would play with him, trying at times to take offhis boots to see his feet, tearing his gloves, putting on his hat; shewould even let him pass his hands through her hair, and take her in hisarms; she accepted, but without pleasure, his ardent kisses. She wouldlook at him silently, without emotion, when his tears flowed; but shealways understood his ""Partant pour la Syrie,"" when he whistled it,though he never succeeded in teaching her to say her own name Stephanie.Philippe was sustained in his agonizing enterprise by hope, which neverabandoned him. When, on fine autumn mornings, he found the countesssitting peacefully on a bench, beneath a poplar now yellowing, the poorlover would sit at her feet, looking into her eyes as long as shewould let him, hoping ever that the light that was in them would becomeintelligent. Sometimes the thought deluded him that he saw those hardimmovable rays softening, vibrating, living, and he cried out,--""Stephanie! Stephanie! thou hearest me, thou seest me!""But she listened to that cry as to a noise, the soughing of the windin the tree-tops, or the lowing of the cow on the back of which sheclimbed. Then the colonel would wring his hands in despair,--despairthat was new each day.One evening, under a calm sky, amid the silence and peace of that ruralhaven, the doctor saw, from a distance, that the colonel was loading hispistols. The old man felt then that the young man had ceased to hope;he felt the blood rushing to his heart, and if he conquered the vertigothat threatened him, it was because he would rather see his niece livingand mad than dead. He hastened up.""What are you doing?"" he said.""That is for me,"" replied the colonel, pointing to a pistol alreadyloaded, which was lying on the bench; ""and this is for her,"" he added,as he forced the wad into the weapon he held.The countess was lying on the ground beside him, playing with the balls.""Then you do not know,"" said the doctor, coldly, concealing his terror,""that in her sleep last night she called you: Philippe!""""She called me!"" cried the baron, dropping his pistol, which Stephaniepicked up. He took it from her hastily, caught up the one that was onthe bench, and rushed away.""Poor darling!"" said the doctor, happy in the success of his lie. Hepressed the poor creature to his breast, and continued speaking tohimself: ""He would have killed thee, selfish man! because he suffers. Hedoes not love thee for thyself, my child! But we forgive, do we not? Heis mad, out of his senses, but thou art only senseless. No, God aloneshould call thee to Him. We think thee unhappy, we pity thee becausethou canst not share our sorrows, fools that we are!--But,"" he said,sitting down and taking her on his knee, ""nothing troubles thee; thylife is like that of a bird, of a fawn--""As he spoke she darted upon a young blackbird which was hopping nearthem, caught it with a little note of satisfaction, strangled it, lookedat it, dead in her hand, and flung it down at the foot of a tree withouta thought.The next day, as soon as it was light, the colonel came down into thegardens, and looked about for Stephanie,--he believed in the cominghappiness. Not finding her he whistled. When his darling came to him, hetook her on his arm; they walked together thus for the first time, andhe led her within a group of trees, the autumn foliage of whichwas dropping to the breeze. The colonel sat down. Of her own accordStephanie placed herself on his knee. Philippe trembled with joy.""Love,"" he said, kissing her hands passionately, ""I am Philippe.""She looked at him with curiosity.""Come,"" he said, pressing her to him, ""dost thou feel my heart? It hasbeaten for thee alone. I love thee ever. Philippe is not dead; he isnot dead, thou art on him, in his arms. Thou art MY Stephanie; I am thyPhilippe.""""Adieu,"" she said, ""adieu.""The colonel quivered, for he fancied he saw his own excitementcommunicated to his mistress. His heart-rending cry, drawn from him bydespair, that last effort of an eternal love, of a delirious passion,was successful, the mind of his darling was awaking.""Ah! Stephanie! Stephanie! we shall yet be happy.""She gave a cry of satisfaction, and her eyes brightened with a flash ofvague intelligence.""She knows me!--Stephanie!""His heart swelled; his eyelids were wet with tears. Then, suddenly, thecountess showed him a bit of sugar she had found in his pocket whilehe was speaking to her. He had mistaken for human thought the amountof reason required for a monkey\'s trick. Philippe dropped to the groundunconscious. Monsieur Fanjat found the countess sitting on the colonel\'sbody. She was biting her sugar, and testifying her pleasure by prettygestures and affectations with which, had she her reason, she might haveimitated her parrot or her cat.""Ah! my friend,"" said Philippe, when he came to his senses, ""I die everyday, every moment! I love too well! I could still bear all, if, inher madness, she had kept her woman\'s nature. But to see her always asavage, devoid even of modesty, to see her--""""You want opera madness, do you? something picturesque and pleasing,""said the doctor, bitterly. ""Your love and your devotion yield beforea prejudice. Monsieur, I have deprived myself for your sake of the sadhappiness of watching over my niece; I have left to you the pleasure ofplaying with her; I have kept for myself the heaviest cares. While youhave slept, I have watched, I have--Go, monsieur, go! abandon her! leavethis sad refuge. I know how to live with that dear darling creature; Icomprehend her madness, I watch her gestures, I know her secrets. Someday you will thank me for thus sending you away.""The colonel left the old monastery, never to return but once. The doctorwas horrified when he saw the effect he had produced upon his guest,whom he now began to love when he saw him thus. Surely, if either of thetwo lovers were worthy of pity, it was Philippe; did he not bear alonethe burden of their dreadful sorrow?After the colonel\'s departure the doctor kept himself informed abouthim; he learned that the miserable man was living on an estate nearSaint-Germain. In truth, the baron, on the faith of a dream, had formeda project which he believed would yet restore the mind of his darling.Unknown to the doctor, he spent the rest of the autumn in preparing forhis enterprise. A little river flowed through his park and inundatedduring the winter the marshes on either side of it, giving it someresemblance to the Beresina. The village of Satout, on the heightsabove, closed in, like Studzianka, the scene of horror. The colonelcollected workmen to deepen the banks, and by the help of his memory, hecopied in his park the shore where General Eble destroyed the bridge.He planted piles, and made buttresses and burned them, leaving theircharred and blackened ruins, standing in the water from shore to shore.Then he gathered fragments of all kinds, like those of which the raftwas built. He ordered dilapidated uniforms and clothing of every grade,and hired hundreds of peasants to wear them; he erected huts and cabinsfor the purpose of burning them. In short, he forgot nothing that mightrecall that most awful of all scenes, and he succeeded.Toward the last of December, when the snow had covered with its thick,white mantle all his imitative preparations, he recognized the Beresina.This false Russia was so terribly truthful, that several of his armycomrades recognized the scene of their past misery at once. Monsieurde Sucy took care to keep secret the motive for this tragic imitation,which was talked of in several Parisian circles as a proof of insanity.Early in January, 1820, the colonel drove in a carriage, the verycounterpart of the one in which he had driven the Comte and Comtesse deVandieres from Moscow to Studzianka. The horses, too, were like those hehad gone, at the peril of his life, to fetch from the Russian outposts.He himself wore the soiled fantastic clothing, the same weapons, as onthe 29th of November, 1812. He had let his beard grow, also his hair,which was tangled and matted, and his face was neglected, so thatnothing might be wanting to represent the awful truth.""I can guess your purpose,"" cried Monsieur Fanjat, when he saw thecolonel getting out of the carriage. ""If you want to succeed, do notlet my niece see you in that equipage. To-night I will give her opium.During her sleep, we will dress her as she was at Studzianka, and placeher in the carriage. I will follow you in another vehicle.""About two in the morning, the sleeping countess was placed in thecarriage and wrapped in heavy coverings. A few peasants with torcheslighted up this strange abduction. Suddenly, a piercing cry broke thesilence of the night. Philippe and the doctor turned, and saw Genevievecoming half-naked from the ground-floor room in which she slept.""Adieu, adieu! all is over, adieu!"" she cried, weeping hot tears.""Genevieve, what troubles you?"" asked the doctor.Genevieve shook her head with a motion of despair, raised her arm toheaven, looked at the carriage, uttering a long-drawn moan with everysign of the utmost terror; then she returned to her room silently.""That is a good omen!"" cried the colonel. ""She feels she is to lose hercompanion. Perhaps she SEES that Stephanie will recover her reason.""""God grant it!"" said Monsieur Fanjat, who himself was affected by theincident.Ever since he had made a close study of insanity, the good man hadmet with many examples of the prophetic faculty and the gift of secondsight, proofs of which are frequently given by alienated minds, andwhich may also be found, so travellers say, among certain tribes ofsavages.As the colonel had calculated, Stephanie crossed the fictitious plain ofthe Beresina at nine o\'clock in the morning, when she was awakened by acannon shot not a hundred yards from the spot where the experiment wasto be tried. This was a signal. Hundreds of peasants made a frightfulclamor like that on the shore of the river that memorable night, whentwenty thousand stragglers were doomed to death or slavery by their ownfolly.At the cry, at the shot, the countess sprang from the carriage, and ran,with delirious emotion, over the snow to the banks of the river; she sawthe burned bivouacs and the charred remains of the bridge, and the fatalraft, which the men were launching into the icy waters of the Beresina.The major, Philippe, was there, striking back the crowd with his sabre.Madame de Vandieres gave a cry, which went to all hearts, and threwherself before the colonel, whose heart beat wildly. She seemed togather herself together, and, at first, looked vaguely at the singularscene. For an instant, as rapid as the lightning\'s flash, her eyes hadthat lucidity, devoid of mind, which we admire in the eye of birds; thenpassing her hand across her brow with the keen expression of one whomeditates, she contemplated the living memory of a past scene spreadbefore her, and, turning quickly to Philippe, she SAW HIM. An awfulsilence reigned in the crowd. The colonel gasped, but dared not speak;the doctor wept. Stephanie\'s sweet face colored faintly; then, from tintto tint, it returned to the brightness of youth, till it glowed witha beautiful crimson. Life and happiness, lighted by intelligence, camenearer and nearer like a conflagration. Convulsive trembling rose fromher feet to her heart. Then these phenomena seemed to blend in one asStephanie\'s eyes cast forth a celestial ray, the flame of a livingsoul. She lived, she thought! She shuddered, with fear perhaps, for Godhimself unloosed that silent tongue, and cast anew His fires into thatlong-extinguished soul. Human will came with its full electric torrent,and vivified the body from which it had been driven.""Stephanie!"" cried the colonel.""Oh! it is Philippe,"" said the poor countess.She threw herself into the trembling arms that the colonel held out toher, and the clasp of the lovers frightened the spectators. Stephanieburst into tears. Suddenly her tears stopped, she stiffened as thoughthe lightning had touched her, and said in a feeble voice,--""Adieu, Philippe; I love thee, adieu!""""Oh! she is dead,"" cried the colonel, opening his arms.The old doctor received the inanimate body of his niece, kissed it asthough he were a young man, and carrying it aside, sat down with itstill in his arms on a pile of wood. He looked at the countess andplaced his feeble trembling hand upon her heart. That heart no longerbeat.""It is true,"" he said, looking up at the colonel, who stood motionless,and then at Stephanie, on whom death was placing that resplendentbeauty, that fugitive halo, which is, perhaps, a pledge of the gloriousfuture--""Yes, she is dead.""""Ah! that smile,"" cried Philippe, ""do you see that smile? Can it betrue?""""She is turning cold,"" replied Monsieur Fanjat.Monsieur de Sucy made a few steps to tear himself away from the sight;but he stopped, whistled the air that Stephanie had known, and when shedid not come to him, went on with staggering steps like a drunken man,still whistling, but never turning back.General Philippe de Sucy was thought in the social world to be a veryagreeable man, and above all a very gay one. A few days ago, a ladycomplimented him on his good humor, and the charming equability of hisnature.""Ah! madame,"" he said, ""I pay dear for my liveliness in my lonelyevenings.""""Are you ever alone?"" she said.""No,"" he replied smiling.If a judicious observer of human nature could have seen at that momentthe expression on the Comte de Sucy\'s face, he would perhaps haveshuddered.""Why don\'t you marry?"" said the lady, who had several daughters atschool. ""You are rich, titled, and of ancient lineage; you have talents,and a great future before you; all things smile upon you.""""Yes,"" he said, ""but a smile kills me.""The next day the lady heard with great astonishment that Monsieur deSucy had blown his brains out during the night. The upper ranks ofsociety talked in various ways over this extraordinary event, and eachperson looked for the cause of it. According to the proclivities of eachreasoner, play, love, ambition, hidden disorders, and vices, explainedthe catastrophe, the last scene of a drama begun in 1812.

81,2,Chapter 2,"['I. PRO AND CONMonsieur de Manerville, the father, was a worthy Norman gentleman,well known to the Marechael de Richelieu, who married him to one of therichest heiresses of Bordeaux in the days when the old duke reigned inGuienne as governor. The Norman then sold the estate he owned in Bessin,and became a Gascon, allured by the beauty of the chateau de Lanstrac,a delightful residence owned by his wife. During the last days of thereign of Louis XV., he bought the post of major of the Gate Guards, andlived till 1813, having by great good luck escaped the dangers of theRevolution in the following manner.Toward the close of the year, 1790, he went to Martinque, where his wifehad interests, leaving the management of his property in Gascogne to anhonest man, a notary\'s clerk, named Mathias, who was inclined to--orat any rate did--give into the new ideas. On his return the Comte deManerville found his possessions intact and well-managed. This soundresult was the fruit produced by grafting the Gascon on the Norman.Madame de Manerville died in 1810. Having learned the importance ofworldly goods through the dissipations of his youth, and, giving them,like many another old man, a higher place than they really hold in life,Monsieur de Manerville became increasingly economical, miserly, andsordid. Without reflecting that the avarice of parents prepares the wayfor the prodigalities of children, he allowed almost nothing to his son,although that son was an only child.Paul de Manerville, coming home from the college of Vendome in 1810,lived under close paternal discipline for three years. The tyranny bywhich the old man of seventy oppressed his heir influenced, necessarily,a heart and a character which were not yet formed. Paul, the son,without lacking the physical courage which is vital in the air ofGascony, dared not struggle against his father, and consequently lostthat faculty of resistance which begets moral courage. His thwartedfeelings were driven to the depths of his heart, where they remainedwithout expression; later, when he felt them to be out of harmony withthe maxims of the world, he could only think rightly and act mistakenly.He was capable of fighting for a mere word or look, yet he trembled atthe thought of dismissing a servant,--his timidity showing itself inthose contests only which required a persistent will. Capable of doinggreat things to fly from persecution, he would never have prevented itby systematic opposition, nor have faced it with the steady employmentof force of will. Timid in thought, bold in actions, he long preservedthat inward simplicity which makes a man the dupe and the voluntaryvictim of things against which certain souls hesitate to revolt,preferring to endure them rather than complain. He was, in point offact, imprisoned by his father\'s old mansion, for he had not enoughmoney to consort with young men; he envied their pleasures while unableto share them.The old gentleman took him every evening, in an old carriage drawnby ill-harnessed old horses, attended by ill-dressed old servants, toroyalist houses, where he met a society composed of the relics of theparliamentary nobility and the martial nobility. These two nobilitiescoalescing after the Revolution, had now transformed themselves intoa landed aristocracy. Crushed by the vast and swelling fortunes of themaritime cities, this Faubourg Saint-Germain of Bordeaux respondedby lofty disdain to the sumptuous displays of commerce, governmentadministrations, and the military. Too young to understand socialdistinctions and the necessities underlying the apparent assumptionwhich they create, Paul was bored to death among these ancients, unawarethat the connections of his youth would eventually secure to him thataristocratic pre-eminence which Frenchmen will forever desire.He found some slight compensations for the dulness of these evenings incertain manual exercises which always delight young men, and which hisfather enjoined upon him. The old gentleman considered that to know theart of fencing and the use of arms, to ride well on horseback, to playtennis, to acquire good manners,--in short, to possess all the frivolousaccomplishments of the old nobility,--made a young man of the presentday a finished gentleman. Accordingly, Paul took a fencing-lesson everymorning, went to the riding-school, and practised in a pistol-gallery.The rest of his time was spent in reading novels, for his father wouldnever have allowed the more abstruse studies now considered necessary tofinish an education.So monotonous a life would soon have killed the poor youth if the deathof the old man had not delivered him from this tyranny at the momentwhen it was becoming intolerable. Paul found himself in possession ofconsiderable capital, accumulated by his father\'s avarice, together withlanded estates in the best possible condition. But he now held Bordeauxin horror; neither did he like Lanstrac, where his father had taken himto spend the summers, employing his whole time from morning till nightin hunting.As soon as the estate was fairly settled, the young heir, eager forenjoyment, bought consols with his capital, left the management of thelanded property to old Mathias, his father\'s notary, and spent the nextsix years away from Bordeaux. At first he was attached to the Frenchembassy at Naples; after that he was secretary of legation at Madrid,and then in London,--making in this way the tour of Europe.After seeing the world and life, after losing several illusions, afterdissipating all the loose capital which his father had amassed, therecame a time when, in order to continue his way of life, Paul was forcedto draw upon the territorial revenues which his notary was laying by. Atthis critical moment, seized by one of the so-called virtuous impulses,he determined to leave Paris, return to Bordeaux, regulate his affairs,lead the life of a country gentleman at Lanstrac, improve his property,marry, and become, in the end, a deputy.Paul was a count; nobility was once more of matrimonial value; he could,and he ought to make a good marriage. While many women desire a title,many others like to marry a man to whom a knowledge of life is familiar.Now Paul had acquired, in exchange for the sum of seven hundred thousandfrancs squandered in six years, that possession, which cannot be boughtand is practically of more value than gold and silver; a knowledgewhich exacts long study, probation, examinations, friends, enemies,acquaintances, certain manners, elegance of form and demeanor, agraceful and euphonious name,--a knowledge, moreover, which meansmany love-affairs, duels, bets lost on a race-course, disillusions,deceptions, annoyances, toils, and a vast variety of undigestedpleasures. In short, he had become what is called elegant. But in spiteof his mad extravagance he had never made himself a mere fashionableman. In the burlesque army of men of the world, the man of fashion holdsthe place of a marshal of France, the man of elegance is the equivalentof a lieutenant-general. Paul enjoyed his lesser reputation,of elegance, and knew well how to sustain it. His servants werewell-dressed, his equipages were cited, his suppers had a certain vogue;in short, his bachelor establishment was counted among the seven oreight whose splendor equalled that of the finest houses in Paris.But--he had not caused the wretchedness of any woman; he gambled withoutlosing; his luck was not notorious; he was far too upright to deceiveor mislead any one, no matter who, even a wanton; never did he leavehis billets-doux lying about, and he possessed no coffer or desk forlove-letters which his friends were at liberty to read while he tiedhis cravat or trimmed his beard. Moreover, not willing to dip into hisGuienne property, he had not that bold extravagance which leads to greatstrokes and calls attention at any cost to the proceedings of a youngman. Neither did he borrow money, but he had the folly to lend tofriends, who then deserted him and spoke of him no more either for goodor evil. He seemed to have regulated his dissipations methodically. Thesecret of his character lay in his father\'s tyranny, which had made him,as it were, a social mongrel.So, one morning, he said to a friend named de Marsay, who afterwardsbecame celebrated:--""My dear fellow, life has a meaning.""""You must be twenty-seven years of age before you can find it out,""replied de Marsay, laughing.""Well, I am twenty-seven; and precisely because I am twenty-seven I meanto live the life of a country gentleman at Lanstrac. I\'ll transportmy belongings to Bordeaux into my father\'s old mansion, and I\'ll spendthree months of the year in Paris in this house, which I shall keep.""""Will you marry?""""I will marry.""""I\'m your friend, as you know, my old Paul,"" said de Marsay, after amoment\'s silence, ""and I say to you: settle down into a worthy fatherand husband and you\'ll be ridiculous for the rest of your days. If youcould be happy and ridiculous, the thing might be thought of; butyou will not be happy. You haven\'t a strong enough wrist to drive ahousehold. I\'ll do you justice and say you are a perfect horseman; noone knows as well as you how to pick up or thrown down the reins, andmake a horse prance, and sit firm to the saddle. But, my dear fellow,marriage is another thing. I see you now, led along at a slappingpace by Madame la Comtesse de Manerville, going whither you would not,oftener at a gallop than a trot, and presently unhorsed!--yes, unhorsedinto a ditch and your legs broken. Listen to me. You still have someforty-odd thousand francs a year from your property in the Gironde.Good. Take your horses and servants and furnish your house in Bordeaux;you can be king of Bordeaux, you can promulgate there the edicts thatwe put forth in Paris; you can be the correspondent of our stupidities.Very good. Play the rake in the provinces; better still, commit follies;follies may win you celebrity. But--don\'t marry. Who marries now-a-days?Only merchants, for the sake of their capital, or to be two to drag thecart; only peasants who want to produce children to work for them; onlybrokers and notaries who want a wife\'s \'dot\' to pay for their practice;only miserable kings who are forced to continue their miserabledynasties. But we are exempt from the pack, and you want to shoulder it!And why DO you want to marry? You ought to give your best friendyour reasons. In the first place, if you marry an heiress as rich asyourself, eighty thousand francs a year for two is not the same thing asforty thousand francs a year for one, because the two are soon three orfour when the children come. You haven\'t surely any love for that sillyrace of Manerville which would only hamper you? Are you ignorant of whata father and mother have to be? Marriage, my old Paul, is the silliestof all the social immolations; our children alone profit by it, anddon\'t know its price until their horses are nibbling the flowers on ourgrave. Do you regret your father, that old tyrant who made your firstyears wretched? How can you be sure that your children will love you?The very care you take of their education, your precautions for theirhappiness, your necessary sternness will lessen their affection.Children love a weak or a prodigal father, whom they will despise inafter years. You\'ll live betwixt fear and contempt. No man is a goodhead of a family merely because he wants to be. Look round on all ourfriends and name to me one whom you would like to have for a son. Wehave known a good many who dishonor their names. Children, my dear Paul,are the most difficult kind of merchandise to take care of. Yours, youthink, will be angels; well, so be it! Have you ever sounded the gulfwhich lies between the lives of a bachelor and a married man? Listen. Asa bachelor you can say to yourself: \'I shall never exhibit more thana certain amount of the ridiculous; the public will think of me whatI choose it to think.\' Married, you\'ll drop into the infinitude of theridiculous! Bachelor, you can make your own happiness; you enjoy someto-day, you do without it to-morrow; married, you must take it as itcomes; and the day you want it you will have to go without it. Marry,and you\'ll grow a blockhead; you\'ll calculate dowries; you\'ll talkmorality, public and religious; you\'ll think young men immoral anddangerous; in short, you\'ll become a social academician. It\'s pitiable!The old bachelor whose property the heirs are waiting for, who fightsto his last breath with his nurse for a spoonful of drink, is blest incomparison with a married man. I\'m not speaking of all that willhappen to annoy, bore, irritate, coerce, oppose, tyrannize, narcotize,paralyze, and idiotize a man in marriage, in that struggle of two beingsalways in one another\'s presence, bound forever, who have coupled eachother under the strange impression that they were suited. No, to tellyou those things would be merely a repetition of Boileau, and we knowhim by heart. Still, I\'ll forgive your absurd idea if you will promiseme to marry ""en grand seigneur""; to entail your property; to have twolegitimate children, to give your wife a house and household absolutelydistinct from yours; to meet her only in society, and never to returnfrom a journey without sending her a courier to announce it. Two hundredthousand francs a year will suffice for such a life and your antecedentswill enable you to marry some rich English woman hungry for a title.That\'s an aristocratic life which seems to me thoroughly French; theonly life in which we can retain the respect and friendship of a woman;the only life which distinguishes a man from the present crowd,--inshort, the only life for which a young man should even think ofresigning his bachelor blessings. Thus established, the Comte deManerville may advise his epoch, place himself above the world, and benothing less than a minister or an ambassador. Ridicule can never touchhim; he has gained the social advantages of marriage while keeping allthe privileges of a bachelor.""""But, my good friend, I am not de Marsay; I am plainly, as you yourselfdo me the honor to say, Paul de Manerville, worthy father and husband,deputy of the Centre, possibly peer of France,--a destiny extremelycommonplace; but I am modest and I resign myself.""""Yes, but your wife,"" said the pitiless de Marsay, ""will she resignherself?""""My wife, my dear fellow, will do as I wish.""""Ah! my poor friend, is that where you are? Adieu, Paul. Henceforth, Irefuse to respect you. One word more, however, for I cannot agree coldlyto your abdication. Look and see in what the strength of our positionlies. A bachelor with only six thousand francs a year remaining to himhas at least his reputation for elegance and the memory of success.Well, even that fantastic shadow has enormous value in it. Life stilloffers many chances to the unmarried man. Yes, he can aim at anything.But marriage, Paul, is the social \'Thus far shalt thou go and nofarther.\' Once married you can never be anything but what you thenare--unless your wife should deign to care for you.""""But,"" said Paul, ""you are crushing me down with exceptional theories. Iam tired of living for others; of having horses merely to exhibit them;of doing all things for the sake of what may be said of them; of wastingmy substance to keep fools from crying out: \'Dear, dear! Paul is stilldriving the same carriage. What has he done with his fortune? Doeshe squander it? Does he gamble at the Bourse? No, he\'s a millionaire.Madame such a one is mad about him. He sent to England for a harnesswhich is certainly the handsomest in all Paris. The four-horseequipages of Messieurs de Marsay and de Manerville were much noticedat Longchamps; the harness was perfect\'--in short, the thousand sillythings with which a crowd of idiots lead us by the nose. Believe me, mydear Henri, I admire your power, but I don\'t envy it. You know how tojudge of life; you think and act as a statesman; you are able to placeyourself above all ordinary laws, received ideas, adopted conventions,and acknowledged prejudices; in short, you can grasp the profits ofa situation in which I should find nothing but ill-luck. Your cool,systematic, possibly true deductions are, to the eyes of the masses,shockingly immoral. I belong to the masses. I must play my game of lifeaccording to the rules of the society in which I am forced to live.While putting yourself above all human things on peaks of ice, you stillhave feelings; but as for me, I should freeze to death. The life of thatgreat majority, to which I belong in my commonplace way, is made upof emotions of which I now have need. Often a man coquets with a dozenwomen and obtains none. Then, whatever be his strength, his cleverness,his knowledge of the world, he undergoes convulsions, in which he iscrushed as between two gates. For my part, I like the peaceful chancesand changes of life; I want that wholesome existence in which we find awoman always at our side.""""A trifle indecorous, your marriage!"" exclaimed de Marsay.Paul was not to be put out of countenance, and continued: ""Laugh if youlike; I shall feel myself a happy man when my valet enters my roomin the morning and says: \'Madame is awaiting monsieur for breakfast\';happier still at night, when I return to find a heart--""""Altogether indecorous, my dear Paul. You are not yet moral enough tomarry.""""--a heart in which to confide my interests and my secrets. I wishto live in such close union with a woman that our affection shall notdepend upon a yes or a no, or be open to the disillusions of love. Inshort, I have the necessary courage to become, as you say, a worthyhusband and father. I feel myself fitted for family joys; I wish to putmyself under the conditions prescribed by society; I desire to have awife and children.""""You remind me of a hive of honey-bees! But go your way, you\'ll be adupe all your life. Ha, ha! you wish to marry to have a wife! In otherwords, you wish to solve satisfactorily to your own profit the mostdifficult problem invented by those bourgeois morals which were createdby the French Revolution; and, what is more, you mean to begin yourattempt by a life of retirement. Do you think your wife won\'t crave thelife you say you despise? Will _she_ be disgusted with it, as you are?If you won\'t accept the noble conjugality just formulated for yourbenefit by your friend de Marsay, listen, at any rate, to his finaladvice. Remain a bachelor for the next thirteen years; amuse yourselflike a lost soul; then, at forty, on your first attack of gout, marry awidow of thirty-six. Then you may possibly be happy. If you now take ayoung girl to wife, you\'ll die a madman.""""Ah ca! tell me why!"" cried Paul, somewhat piqued.""My dear fellow,"" replied de Marsay, ""Boileau\'s satire against women isa tissue of poetical commonplaces. Why shouldn\'t women have defects? Whycondemn them for having the most obvious thing in human nature? To mymind, the problem of marriage is not at all at the point where Boileauputs it. Do you suppose that marriage is the same thing as love, andthat being a man suffices to make a wife love you? Have you gatherednothing in your boudoir experience but pleasant memories? I tell youthat everything in our bachelor life leads to fatal errors in themarried man unless he is a profound observer of the human heart. In thehappy days of his youth a man, by the caprice of our customs, is alwayslucky; he triumphs over women who are all ready to be triumphed overand who obey their own desires. One thing after another--the obstaclescreated by the laws, the sentiments and natural defences of women--allengender a mutuality of sensations which deceives superficial persons asto their future relations in marriage, where obstacles no longer exist,where the wife submits to love instead of permitting it, and frequentlyrepulses pleasure instead of desiring it. Then, the whole aspect of aman\'s life changes. The bachelor, who is free and without a care, neednever fear repulsion; in marriage, repulsion is almost certain andirreparable. It may be possible for a lover to make a woman reverse anunfavorable decision, but such a change, my dear Paul, is the Waterlooof husbands. Like Napoleon, the husband is thenceforth condemned tovictories which, in spite of their number, do not prevent the firstdefeat from crushing him. The woman, so flattered by the perseverance,so delighted with the ardor of a lover, calls the same things brutalityin a husband. You, who talk of marrying, and who will marry, have youever meditated on the Civil Code? I myself have never muddied my feetin that hovel of commentators, that garret of gossip, called theLaw-school. I have never so much as opened the Code; but I see itsapplication on the vitals of society. The Code, my dear Paul, makeswoman a ward; it considers her a child, a minor. Now how must we governchildren? By fear. In that one word, Paul, is the curb of thebeast. Now, feel your own pulse! Have you the strength to play thetyrant,--you, so gentle, so kind a friend, so confiding; you, at whomI have laughed, but whom I love, and love enough to reveal to you myscience? For this is science. Yes, it proceeds from a science whichthe Germans are already calling Anthropology. Ah! if I had not alreadysolved the mystery of life by pleasure, if I had not a profoundantipathy for those who think instead of act, if I did not despise theninnies who are silly enough to believe in the truth of a book, whenthe sands of the African deserts are made of the ashes of I know nothow many unknown and pulverized Londons, Romes, Venices, and Parises, Iwould write a book on modern marriages made under the influence of theChristian system, and I\'d stick a lantern on that heap of sharp stonesamong which lie the votaries of the social \'multiplicamini.\' But thequestion is, Does humanity require even an hour of my time? And besides,isn\'t the more reasonable use of ink that of snaring hearts by writinglove-letters?--Well, shall you bring the Comtesse de Manerville here,and let us see her?""""Perhaps,"" said Paul.""We shall still be friends,"" said de Marsay.""If--"" replied Paul.""Don\'t be uneasy; we will treat you politely, as Maison-Rouge treatedthe English at Fontenoy.""']"
81,3,Chapter 3,"['II. THE PINK OF FASHIONThough the foregoing conversation affected the Comte de Manervillesomewhat, he made it a point of duty to carry out his intentions, and hereturned to Bordeaux during the winter of the year 1821.The expenses he incurred in restoring and furnishing his family mansionsustained the reputation for elegance which had preceded him. Introducedthrough his former connections to the royalist society of Bordeaux, towhich he belonged as much by his personal opinions as by his name andfortune, he soon obtained a fashionable pre-eminence. His knowledgeof life, his manners, his Parisian acquirements enchanted the FaubourgSaint-Germain of Bordeaux. An old marquise made use of a term formerlyin vogue at court to express the flowery beauty of the fops and beaux ofthe olden time, whose language and demeanor were social laws: she calledhim ""the pink of fashion."" The liberal clique caught up the word andused it satirically as a nickname, while the royalist party continued toemploy it in good faith.Paul de Manerville acquitted himself gloriously of the obligationsimposed by his flowery title. It happened to him, as to many a mediocreactor, that the day when the public granted him their full attention hebecame, one may almost say, superior. Feeling at his ease, he displayedthe fine qualities which accompanied his defects. His wit hadnothing sharp or bitter in it; his manners were not supercilious; hisintercourse with women expressed the respect they like,--it was neithertoo deferential, nor too familiar; his foppery went no farther than acare for his personal appearance which made him agreeable; he showedconsideration for rank; he allowed young men a certain freedom, to whichhis Parisian experience assigned due limits; though skilful with swordand pistol, he was noted for a feminine gentleness for which others weregrateful. His medium height and plumpness (which had not yet increasedinto obesity, an obstacle to personal elegance) did not prevent hisouter man from playing the part of a Bordelais Brummell. A white skintinged with the hues of health, handsome hands and feet, blue eyes withlong lashes, black hair, graceful motions, a chest voice which kept toits middle tones and vibrated in the listener\'s heart, harmonized wellwith his sobriquet. Paul was indeed that delicate flower which needssuch careful culture, the qualities of which display themselves only ina moist and suitable soil,--a flower which rough treatment dwarfs, whichthe hot sun burns, and a frost lays low. He was one of those men madeto receive happiness, rather than to give it; who have something of thewoman in their nature, wishing to be divined, understood, encouraged; inshort, a man to whom conjugal love ought to come as a providence.If such a character creates difficulties in private life, it is graciousand full of attraction for the world. Consequently, Paul had greatsuccess in the narrow social circle of the provinces, where his mind,always, so to speak, in half-tints, was better appreciated than inParis.The arrangement of his house and the restoration of the chateau deLanstrac, where he introduced the comfort and luxury of an Englishcountry-house, absorbed the capital saved by the notary during thepreceding six years. Reduced now to his strict income of forty-oddthousand a year, he thought himself wise and prudent in so regulatinghis household as not to exceed it.After publicly exhibiting his equipages, entertaining the mostdistinguished young men of the place, and giving various hunting partieson the estate at Lanstrac, Paul saw very plainly that provincial lifewould never do without marriage. Too young to employ his time inmiserly occupations, or in trying to interest himself in the speculativeimprovements in which provincials sooner or later engage (compelledthereto by the necessity of establishing their children), he soon feltthe need of that variety of distractions a habit of which becomesat last the very life of a Parisian. A name to preserve, property totransmit to heirs, social relations to be created by a householdwhere the principal families of the neighborhood could assemble, anda weariness of all irregular connections, were not, however, thedetermining reasons of his matrimonial desires. From the time he firstreturned to the provinces he had been secretly in love with the queen ofBordeaux, the great beauty, Mademoiselle Evangelista.About the beginning of the century, a rich Spaniard, named Evangelista,established himself in Bordeaux, where his letters of recommendation,as well as his large fortune, gave him an entrance to the salons ofthe nobility. His wife contributed greatly to maintain him in the goodgraces of an aristocracy which may perhaps have adopted him in the firstinstance merely to pique the society of the class below them. MadameEvangelista, who belonged to the Casa-Reale, an illustrious family ofSpain, was a Creole, and, like all women served by slaves, she lived asa great lady, knew nothing of the value of money, repressed no whims,even the most expensive, finding them ever satisfied by an adoringhusband who generously concealed from her knowledge the running-gear ofthe financial machine. Happy in finding her pleased with Bordeaux, wherehis interests obliged him to live, the Spaniard bought a house, set up ahousehold, received in much style, and gave many proofs of possessing afine taste in all things. Thus, from 1800 to 1812, Monsieur and MadameEvangelista were objects of great interest to the community of Bordeaux.The Spaniard died in 1813, leaving his wife a widow at thirty-two yearsof age, with an immense fortune and the prettiest little girl in theworld, a child of eleven, who promised to be, and did actually become,a most accomplished young woman. Clever as Madame Evangelista was, theRestoration altered her position; the royalist party cleared its ranksand several of the old families left Bordeaux. Though the head and handof her husband were lacking in the direction of her affairs, for whichshe had hitherto shown the indifference of a Creole and the inaptitudeof a lackadaisical woman, she was determined to make no change in hermanner of living. At the period when Paul resolved to return to hisnative town, Mademoiselle Natalie Evangelista was a remarkably beautifulyoung girl, and, apparently, the richest match in Bordeaux, where thesteady diminution of her mother\'s capital was unknown. In order toprolong her reign, Madame Evangelista had squandered enormous sums.Brilliant fetes and the continuation of an almost regal style of livingkept the public in its past belief as to the wealth of the Spanishfamily.Natalie was now in her nineteenth year, but no proposal of marriagehad as yet reached her mother\'s ear. Accustomed to gratify her fancies,Mademoiselle Evangelista wore cashmeres and jewels, and lived in a styleof luxury which alarmed all speculative suitors in a region and at aperiod when sons were as calculating as their parents. The fatal remark,""None but a prince can afford to marry Mademoiselle Evangelista,""circulated among the salons and the cliques. Mothers of families,dowagers who had granddaughters to establish, young girls jealous ofNatalie, whose elegance and tyrannical beauty annoyed them, took painsto envenom this opinion with treacherous remarks. When they heard apossible suitor say with ecstatic admiration, as Natalie entered aball-room, ""Heavens, how beautiful she is!"" ""Yes,"" the mammas wouldanswer, ""but expensive."" If some new-comer thought MademoiselleEvangelista bewitching and said to a marriageable man that he couldn\'tdo it better, ""Who would be bold enough,"" some woman would reply, ""tomarry a girl whose mother gives her a thousand francs a month for hertoilet,--a girl who has horses and a maid of her own, and wears laces?Yes, her \'peignoirs\' are trimmed with mechlin. The price of her washingwould support the household of a clerk. She wears pelerines in themorning which actually cost six francs to get up.""These, and other speeches said occasionally in the form of praiseextinguished the desires that some men might have had to marry thebeautiful Spanish girl. Queen of every ball, accustomed to flattery,""blasee"" with the smiles and the admiration which followed her everystep, Natalie, nevertheless, knew nothing of life. She lived as thebird which flies, as the flower that blooms, finding every one about hereager to do her will. She was ignorant of the price of things; sheknew neither the value of money, nor whence it came, how it should bemanaged, and how spent. Possibly she thought that every household hadcooks and coachmen, lady\'s-maids and footmen, as the fields have hay andthe trees their fruits. To her, beggars and paupers, fallen trees andwaste lands seemed in the same category. Pampered and petted as hermother\'s hope, no fatigue was allowed to spoil her pleasure. Thus shebounded through life as a courser on his steppe, unbridled and unshod.Six month\'s after Paul\'s arrival the Pink of Fashion and the Queen ofBalls met in presence of the highest society of the town of Bordeaux.The two flowers looked at each other with apparent coldness, andmutually thought each other charming. Interested in watching the effectsof the meeting, Madame Evangelista divined in the expression of Paul\'seyes the feelings within him, and she muttered to herself, ""He will bemy son-in-law."" Paul, on the other hand, said to himself, as he lookedat Natalie, ""She will be my wife.""The wealth of the Evangelistas, proverbial in Bordeaux, had remained inPaul\'s mind as a memory of his childhood. Thus the pecuniary conditionswere known to him from the start, without necessitating thosediscussions and inquiries which are as repugnant to a timid mind as to aproud one. When some persons attempting to say to Paul a few flatteringphrases as to Natalie\'s manner, language, and beauty, ending by remarks,cruelly calculated to deter him, on the lavish extravagance of theEvangelistas, the Pink of Fashion replied with a disdain that waswell-deserved by such provincial pettiness. This method of receivingsuch speeches soon silenced them; for he now set the tone to the ideasand language as well as to the manners of those about him. He hadimported from his travels a certain development of the Britannicpersonality with its icy barriers, also a tone of Byronic pessimismas to life, together with English plate, boot-polish, ponies, yellowgloves, cigars, and the habit of galloping.It thus happened that Paul escaped the discouragements hithertopresented to marriageable men by dowagers and young girls. MadameEvangelista began by asking him to formal dinners on various occasions.The Pink of Fashion would not, of course, miss festivities to which nonebut the most distinguished young men of the town were bidden. In spiteof the coldness that Paul assumed, which deceived neither mothernor daughter, he was drawn, step by step, into the path of marriage.Sometimes as he passed in his tilbury, or rode by on his fine Englishhorse, he heard the young men of his acquaintance say to one another:--""There\'s a lucky man. He is rich and handsome, and is to marry, so theysay, Mademoiselle Evangelista. There are some men for whom the worldseems made.""When he met the Evangelistas he felt proud of the particular distinctionwhich mother and daughter imparted to their bows. If Paul had notsecretly, within his heart, fallen in love with Mademoiselle Natalie,society would certainly have married him to her in spite of himself.Society, which never causes good, is the accomplice of much evil; thenwhen it beholds the evil it has hatched maternally, it rejects andrevenges it. Society in Bordeaux, attributing a ""dot"" of a million toMademoiselle Evangelista, bestowed it upon Paul without awaiting theconsent of either party. Their fortunes, so it was said, agreed as wellas their persons. Paul had the same habits of luxury and elegance inthe midst of which Natalie had been brought up. He had just arranged forhimself a house such as no other man in Bordeaux could have offered her.Accustomed to Parisian expenses and the caprices of Parisian women, healone was fitted to meet the pecuniary difficulties which were likely tofollow this marriage with a girl who was as much of a Creole and a greatlady as her mother. Where they themselves, remarked the marriageablemen, would have been ruined, the Comte de Manerville, rich as he was,could evade disaster. In short, the marriage was made. Persons inthe highest royalist circles said a few engaging words to Paul whichflattered his vanity:--""Every one gives you Mademoiselle Evangelista. If you marry her you willdo well. You could not find, even in Paris, a more delightful girl. Sheis beautiful, graceful, elegant, and takes after the Casa-Reales throughher mother. You will make a charming couple; you have the same tastes,the same desires in life, and you will certainly have the most agreeablehouse in Bordeaux. Your wife need only bring her night-cap; all is readyfor her. You are fortunate indeed in such a mother-in-law. A woman ofintelligence, and very adroit, she will be a great help to you inpublic life, to which you ought to aspire. Besides, she has sacrificedeverything to her daughter, whom she adores, and Natalie will, no doubt,prove a good wife, for she loves her mother. You must soon bring thematter to a conclusion.""""That is all very well,"" replied Paul, who, in spite of his love, wasdesirous of keeping his freedom of action, ""but I must be sure that theconclusion shall be a happy one.""He now went frequently to Madame Evangelista\'s, partly to occupy hisvacant hours, which were harder for him to employ than for most men.There alone he breathed the atmosphere of grandeur and luxury to whichhe was accustomed.At forty years of age, Madame Evangelista was beautiful, with thebeauty of those glorious summer sunsets which crown a cloudless day. Herspotless reputation had given an endless topic of conversation to theBordeaux cliques; the curiosity of the women was all the more livelybecause the widow gave signs of the temperament which makes a Spanishwoman and a Creole particularly noted. She had black eyes and hair, thefeet and form of a Spanish woman,--that swaying form the movements ofwhich have a name in Spain. Her face, still beautiful, was particularlyseductive for its Creole complexion, the vividness of which can bedescribed only by comparing it to muslin overlying crimson, so equallyis the whiteness suffused with color. Her figure, which was full androunded, attracted the eye by a grace which united nonchalance withvivacity, strength with ease. She attracted and she imposed, sheseduced, but promised nothing. She was tall, which gave her at timesthe air and carriage of a queen. Men were taken by her conversationlike birds in a snare; for she had by nature that genius which necessitybestows on schemes; she advanced from concession to concession,strengthening herself with what she gained to ask for more, knowingwell how to retreat with rapid steps when concessions were demanded inreturn. Though ignorant of facts, she had known the courts of Spainand Naples, the celebrated men of the two Americas, many illustriousfamilies of England and the continent, all of which gave her soextensive an education superficially that it seemed immense. Shereceived her society with the grace and dignity which are never learned,but which come to certain naturally fine spirits like a second nature;assimilating choice things wherever they are met. If her reputationfor virtue was unexplained, it gave at any rate much authority to heractions, her conversation, and her character.Mother and daughter had a true friendship for each other, beyond thefilial and maternal sentiment. They suited one another, and theirperpetual contact had never produced the slightest jar. Consequentlymany persons explained Madame Evangelista\'s actions by maternal love.But although Natalie consoled her mother\'s persistent widowhood, she maynot have been the only motive for it. Madame Evangelista had been, itwas said, in love with a man who recovered his titles and propertyunder the Restoration. This man, desirous of marrying her in 1814 haddiscreetly severed the connection in 1816. Madame Evangelista, to allappearance the best-hearted woman in the world, had, in the depths ofher nature, a fearful quality, explainable only by Catherine de Medici\'sdevice: ""Odiate e aspettate""--""Hate and wait."" Accustomed to rule,having always been obeyed, she was like other royalties, amiable,gentle, easy and pleasant in ordinary life, but terrible, implacable,if the pride of the woman, the Spaniard, and the Casa-Reale was touched.She never forgave. This woman believed in the power of her hatred; shemade an evil fate of it and bade it hover above her enemy. This fatalpower she employed against the man who had jilted her. Events whichseemed to prove the influence of her ""jettatura""--the casting of an evileye--confirmed her superstitious faith in herself. Though a minister andpeer of France, this man began to ruin himself, and soon came to totalruin. His property, his personal and public honor were doomed to perish.At this crisis Madame Evangelista in her brilliant equipage passed herfaithless lover walking on foot in the Champes Elysees, and crushed himwith a look which flamed with triumph. This misadventure, which occupiedher mind for two years, was the original cause of her not remarrying.Later, her pride had drawn comparisons between the suitors who presentedthemselves and the husband who had loved her so sincerely and so well.She had thus reached, through mistaken calculations and disappointedhopes, that period of life when women have no other part to take in lifethan that of mother; a part which involves the sacrifice of themselvesto their children, the placing of their interests outside of self uponanother household,--the last refuge of human affections.Madame Evangelista divined Paul\'s nature intuitively, and hid her ownfrom his perception. Paul was the very man she desired for a son-in-law,for the responsible editor of her future power. He belonged, through hismother, to the family of Maulincour, and the old Baronne de Maulincour,the friend of the Vidame de Pamiers, was then living in the centre ofthe faubourg Saint-Germain. The grandson of the baroness, Auguste deMaulincour, held a fine position in the army. Paul would therefore bean excellent introducer for the Evangelistas into Parisian society. Thewidow had known something of the Paris of the Empire, she now desired toshine in the Paris of the Restoration. There alone were the elements ofpolitical fortune, the only business in which women of the world coulddecently co-operate. Madame Evangelista, compelled by her husband\'saffairs to reside in Bordeaux, disliked the place. She desired a widerfield, as gamblers rush to higher stakes. For her own personal ends,therefore, she looked to Paul as a means of destiny, she proposed toemploy the resources of her own talent and knowledge of life to advanceher son-in-law, in order to enjoy through him the delights of power.Many men are thus made the screens of secret feminine ambitions. MadameEvangelista had, however, more than one interest, as we shall see, inlaying hold of her daughter\'s husband.Paul was naturally captivated by this woman, who charmed him all themore because she seemed to seek no influence over him. In reality shewas using her ascendancy to magnify herself, her daughter, and all hersurroundings in his eyes, for the purpose of ruling from the start theman in whom she saw a means of gratifying her social longings. Paul, onthe other hand, began to value himself more highly when he felt himselfappreciated by the mother and daughter. He thought himself much clevererthan he really was when he found his reflections and sayings acceptedand understood by Mademoiselle Natalie--who raised her head and smiledin response to them--and by the mother, whose flattery always seemedinvoluntary. The two women were so kind and friendly to him, he was sosure of pleasing them, they ruled him so delightfully by holding thethread of his self-love, that he soon passed all his time at the hotelEvangelista.A year after his return to Bordeaux, Comte Paul, without having declaredhimself, was so attentive to Natalie that the world considered him ascourting her. Neither mother nor daughter appeared to be thinking ofmarriage. Mademoiselle Evangelista preserved towards Paul the reserveof a great lady who can make herself charming and converse agreeablywithout permitting a single step into intimacy. This reserve, so littlecustomary among provincials, pleased Paul immensely. Timid men are shy;sudden proposals alarm them. They retreat from happiness when it comeswith a rush, and accept misfortune if it presents itself mildly withgentle shadows. Paul therefore committed himself in his own mind all themore because he saw no effort on Madame Evangelista\'s part to bind him.She fairly seduced him one evening by remarking that to superior womenas well as men there came a period of life when ambition superseded allthe earlier emotions of life.""That woman is fitted,"" thought Paul, as he left her, ""to advance me indiplomacy before I am even made a deputy.""If, in all the circumstances of life a man does not turn over and overboth things and ideas in order to examine them thoroughly under theirdifferent aspects before taking action, that man is weak and incompleteand in danger of fatal failure. At this moment Paul was an optimist; hesaw everything to advantage, and did not tell himself than an ambitiousmother-in-law might prove a tyrant. So, every evening as he left thehouse, he fancied himself a married man, allured his mind with its ownthought, and slipped on the slippers of wedlock cheerfully. In the firstplace, he had enjoyed his freedom too long to regret the loss of it; hewas tired of a bachelor\'s life, which offered him nothing new; henow saw only its annoyances; whereas if he thought at times of thedifficulties of marriage, its pleasures, in which lay novelty, came farmore prominently before his mind.""Marriage,"" he said to himself, ""is disagreeable for people withoutmeans, but half its troubles disappear before wealth.""Every day some favorable consideration swelled the advantages which henow saw in this particular alliance.""No matter to what position I attain, Natalie will always be on thelevel of her part,"" thought he, ""and that is no small merit in a woman.How many of the Empire men I\'ve seen who suffered horribly through theirwives! It is a great condition of happiness not to feel one\'s pride orone\'s vanity wounded by the companion we have chosen. A man can neverbe really unhappy with a well-bred wife; she will never make himridiculous; such a woman is certain to be useful to him. Natalie willreceive in her own house admirably.""So thinking, he taxed his memory as to the most distinguished women ofthe faubourg Saint-Germain, in order to convince himself that Nataliecould, if not eclipse them, at any rate stand among them on a footing ofperfect equality. All comparisons were to her advantage, for they restedon his own imagination, which followed his desires. Paris would haveshown him daily other natures, young girls of other styles of beauty andcharm, and the multiplicity of impressions would have balanced his mind;whereas in Bordeaux Natalie had no rivals, she was the solitary flower;moreover, she appeared to him at a moment when Paul was under thetyranny of an idea to which most men succumb at his age.Thus these reasons of propinquity, joined to reasons of self-love and areal passion which had no means of satisfaction except by marriage, ledPaul on to an irrational love, which he had, however, the good sense tokeep to himself. He even endeavored to study Mademoiselle Evangelistaas a man should who desires not to compromise his future life; for thewords of his friend de Marsay did sometimes rumble in his ears like awarning. But, in the first place, persons accustomed to luxury have acertain indifference to it which misleads them. They despise it, theyuse it; it is an instrument, and not the object of their existence. Paulnever imagined, as he observed the habits of life of the two ladies,that they covered a gulf of ruin. Then, though there may exist somegeneral rules to soften the asperities of marriage, there are none bywhich they can be accurately foreseen and evaded. When trouble arisesbetween two persons who have undertaken to render life agreeable andeasy to each other, it comes from the contact of continual intimacy,which, of course, does not exist between young people before they marry,and will never exist so long as our present social laws and customsprevail in France. All is more or less deception between the two youngpersons about to take each other for life,--an innocent and involuntarydeception, it is true. Each endeavors to appear in a favorable light;both take a tone and attitude conveying a more favorable idea of theirnature than they are able to maintain in after years. Real life, likethe weather, is made up of gray and cloudy days alternating with thosewhen the sun shines and the fields are gay. Young people, however,exhibit fine weather and no clouds. Later they attribute to marriage theevils inherent in life itself; for there is in man a disposition to laythe blame of his own misery on the persons and things that surround him.To discover in the demeanor, or the countenance, or the words, or thegestures of Mademoiselle Evangelista any indication that revealed theimperfections of her character, Paul must have possessed not only theknowledge of Lavater and Gall, but also a science in which there existsno formula of doctrine,--the individual and personal science of anobserver, which, for its perfection, requires an almost universalknowledge. Natalie\'s face, like that of most young girls, wasimpenetrable. The deep, serene peace given by sculptors to the virginfaces of Justice and Innocence, divinities aloof from all earthlyagitations, is the greatest charm of a young girl, the sign of herpurity. Nothing, as yet, has stirred her; no shattered passion, no hopebetrayed has clouded the placid expression of that pure face. Is thatexpression assumed? If so, there is no young girl behind it.Natalie, closely held to the heart of her mother, had received, likeother Spanish women, an education that was solely religious, togetherwith a few instructions from her mother as to the part in life she wascalled upon to play. Consequently, the calm, untroubled expression ofher face was natural. And yet it formed a casing in which the womanwas wrapped as the moth in its cocoon. Nevertheless, any man clever athandling the scalpel of analysis might have detected in Natalie certainindications of the difficulties her character would present when broughtinto contact with conjugal or social life. Her beauty, which was reallymarvellous, came from extreme regularity of feature harmonizing with theproportions of the head and the body. This species of perfection augursill for the mind; and there are few exceptions to the rule. All superiornature is found to have certain slight imperfections of form whichbecome irresistible attractions, luminous points from which shine vividsentiments, and on which the eye rests gladly. Perfect harmony expressesusually the coldness of a mixed organization.Natalie\'s waist was round,--a sign of strength, but also the infallibleindication of a will which becomes obstinacy in persons whose mindis neither keen nor broad. Her hands, like those of a Greek statue,confirmed the predictions of face and figure by revealing an inclinationfor illogical domination, of willing for will\'s sake only. Her eyebrowsmet,--a sign, according to some observers, which indicates jealousy. Thejealousy of superior minds becomes emulation and leads to great things;that of small minds turns to hatred. The ""hate and wait"" of her motherwas in her nature, without disguise. Her eyes were black apparently,though really brown with orange streaks, contrasting with her hair,of the ruddy tint so prized by the Romans, called auburn in England, acolor which often appears in the offspring of persons of jet black hair,like that of Monsieur and Madame Evangelista. The whiteness and delicacyof Natalie\'s complexion gave to the contrast of color in her eyes andhair an inexpressible charm; and yet it was a charm that was purelyexternal; for whenever the lines of a face are lacking in a certainsoft roundness, whatever may be the finish and grace of the details, thebeauty therein expressed is not of the soul. These roses of deceptiveyouth will drop their leaves, and you will be surprised in a few yearsto see hardness and dryness where you once admired what seemed to be thebeauty of noble qualities.Though the outlines of Natalie\'s face had something august about them,her chin was slightly ""empate,""--a painter\'s expression which will serveto show the existence of sentiments the violence of which would onlybecome manifest in after life. Her mouth, a trifle drawn in, expresseda haughty pride in keeping with her hand, her chin, her brows, and herbeautiful figure. And--as a last diagnostic to guide the judgment of aconnoisseur--Natalie\'s pure voice, a most seductive voice, had certainmetallic tones. Softly as that brassy ring was managed, and in spite ofthe grace with which its sounds ran through the compass of the voice,that organ revealed the character of the Duke of Alba, from whom theCasa-Reales were collaterally descended. These indications were thoseof violent passions without tenderness, sudden devotions, irreconcilabledislikes, a mind without intelligence, and the desire to rule natural topersons who feel themselves inferior to their pretensions.These defects, born of temperament and constitution, were buried inNatalie like ore in a mine, and would only appear under the shocks andharsh treatment to which all characters are subjected in this world.Meantime the grace and freshness of her youth, the distinction of hermanners, her sacred ignorance, and the sweetness of a young girl, gavea delicate glamour to her features which could not fail to mislead anunthinking or superficial mind. Her mother had early taught her thetrick of agreeable talk which appears to imply superiority, replyingto arguments by clever jests, and attracting by the graceful volubilitybeneath which a woman hides the subsoil of her mind, as Nature disguisesher barren strata beneath a wealth of ephemeral vegetation. Natalie hadthe charm of children who have never known what it is to suffer. Shecharmed by her frankness, and had none of that solemn air which mothersimpose on their daughters by laying down a programme of behavior andlanguage until the time comes when they marry and are emancipated. Shewas gay and natural, like any young girl who knows nothing of marriage,expects only pleasure from it, replies to all objections with a jest,foresees no troubles, and thinks she is acquiring the right to have herown way.How could Paul, who loved as men love when desire increases love,perceive in a girl of this nature whose beauty dazzled him, the woman,such as she would probably be at thirty, when observers themselves havebeen misled by these appearances? Besides, if happiness might provedifficult to find in a marriage with such a girl, it was not impossible.Through these embryo defects shone several fine qualities. There is nogood quality which, if properly developed by the hand of an able master,will not stifle defects, especially in a young girl who loves him. Butto render ductile so intractable a woman, the iron wrist, about which deMarsay had preached to Paul, was needful. The Parisian dandy was right.Fear, inspired by love is an infallible instrument by which to managethe minds of women. Whoso loves, fears; whoso fears is nearer toaffection than to hatred.Had Paul the coolness, firmness, and judgment required for thisstruggle, which an able husband ought not to let the wife suspect? DidNatalie love Paul? Like most young girls, Natalie mistook for love thefirst emotions of instinct and the pleasure she felt in Paul\'s externalappearance; but she knew nothing of the things of marriage northe demands of a home. To her, the Comte de Manerville, a risingdiplomatist, to whom the courts of Europe were known, and one of themost elegant young men in Paris, could not seem, what perhaps he was,an ordinary man, without moral force, timid, though brave in some ways,energetic perhaps in adversity, but helpless against the vexationsand annoyances that hinder happiness. Would she, in after years, havesufficient tact and insight to distinguish Paul\'s noble qualities in themidst of his minor defects? Would she not magnify the latter and forgetthe former, after the manner of young wives who know nothing of life?There comes a time when wives will pardon defects in the husband whospares her annoyances, considering annoyances in the same category asmisfortunes. What conciliating power, what wise experience would upholdand enlighten the home of this young pair? Paul and his wife woulddoubtless think they loved when they had really not advanced beyond theendearments and compliments of the honeymoon. Would Paul in that earlyperiod yield to the tyranny of his wife, instead of establishing hisempire? Could Paul say, ""No?"" All was peril to a man so weak where evena strong man ran some risks.The subject of this Study is not the transition of a bachelor into amarried man,--a picture which, if broadly composed, would not lack theattraction which the inner struggles of our nature and feelings give tothe commonest situations in life. The events and the ideas which led tothe marriage of Paul with Natalie Evangelista are an introduction toour real subject, which is to sketch the great comedy that precedes, inFrance, all conjugal pairing. This Scene, until now singularly neglectedby our dramatic authors, although it offers novel resources to theirwit, controlled Paul\'s future life and was now awaited by MadameEvangelista with feelings of terror. We mean the discussion which takesplace on the subject of the marriage contract in all families, whethernoble or bourgeois, for human passions are as keenly excited by smallinterests as by large ones. These comedies, played before a notary, allresemble, more or less, the one we shall now relate, the interest ofwhich will be far less in the pages of this book than in the memories ofmarried persons.']"
81,4,Chapter 4,"['III. THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT--FIRST DAYAt the beginning of the winter of 1822, Paul de Manerville made a formalrequest, through his great-aunt, the Baronne de Maulincour, for the handof Mademoiselle Natalie Evangelista. Though the baroness never stayedmore than two months in Medoc, she remained on this occasion till thelast of October, in order to assist her nephew through the affair andplay the part of a mother to him. After conveying the first suggestionsto Madame Evangelista the experienced old woman returned to inform Paulof the results of the overture.""My child,"" she said, ""the affair is won. In talking of property, Ifound that Madame Evangelista gives nothing of her own to her daughter.Mademoiselle Natalie\'s dowry is her patrimony. Marry her, my dear boy.Men who have a name and an estate to transmit, a family to continue,must, sooner or later, end in marriage. I wish I could see my dearAuguste taking that course. You can now carry on the marriage withoutme; I have nothing to give you but my blessing, and women as old as Iare out of place at a wedding. I leave for Paris to-morrow. When youpresent your wife in society I shall be able to see her and assist herfar more to the purpose than now. If you had had no house in Paris Iwould gladly have arranged the second floor of mine for you.""""Dear aunt,"" said Paul, ""I thank you heartily. But what do you meanwhen you say that the mother gives nothing of her own, and that thedaughter\'s dowry is her patrimony?""""The mother, my dear boy, is a sly cat, who takes advantage of herdaughter\'s beauty to impose conditions and allow you only that which shecannot prevent you from having; namely, the daughter\'s fortune from herfather. We old people know the importance of inquiring closely, What hashe? What has she? I advise you therefore to give particular instructionsto your notary. The marriage contract, my dear child, is the most sacredof all duties. If your father and your mother had not made theirbed properly you might now be sleeping without sheets. You will havechildren, they are the commonest result of marriage, and you must thinkof them. Consult Maitre Mathias our old notary.""Madame de Maulincour departed, having plunged Paul into a state ofextreme perplexity. His mother-in-law a sly cat! Must he struggle forhis interests in the marriage contract? Was it necessary to defend them?Who was likely to attack them?He followed the advice of his aunt and confided the drawing-up of themarriage contract to Maitre Mathias. But these threatened discussionsoppressed him, and he went to see Madame Evangelista and announce hisintentions in a state of rather lively agitation. Like all timid men, heshrank from allowing the distrust his aunt had put into his mind to beseen; in fact, he considered it insulting. To avoid even a slight jarwith a person so imposing to his mind as his future mother-in-law, heproceeded to state his intentions with the circumlocution natural topersons who dare not face a difficulty.""Madame,"" he said, choosing a moment when Natalie was absent from theroom, ""you know, of course, what a family notary is. Mine is a worthyold man, to whom it would be a sincere grief if he were not entrustedwith the drawing of my marriage contract.""""Why, of course!"" said Madame Evangelista, interrupting him, ""but arenot marriage contracts always made by agreement of the notaries of bothfamilies?""The time that Paul took to reply to this question was occupied by MadameEvangelista in asking herself, ""What is he thinking of?"" for womenpossess in an eminent degree the art of reading thoughts from the playof countenance. She divined the instigations of the great-aunt in theembarrassed glance and the agitated tone of voice which betrayed aninward struggle in Paul\'s mind.""At last,"" she thought to herself, ""the fatal day has come; the crisisbegins--how will it end? My notary is Monsieur Solonet,"" she said, aftera pause. ""Yours, I think you said, is Monsieur Mathias; I will invitethem to dinner to-morrow, and they can come to an understanding then. Itis their business to conciliate our interests without our interference;just as good cooks are expected to furnish good food withoutinstructions.""""Yes, you are right,"" said Paul, letting a faint sigh of relief escapefrom him.By a singular transposition of parts, Paul, innocent of all wrong-doing,trembled, while Madame Evangelista, though a prey to the utmost anxiety,was outwardly calm.The widow owed her daughter one-third of the fortune left by MonsieurEvangelista,--namely, nearly twelve hundred thousand francs,--and sheknew herself unable to pay it, even by taking the whole of her propertyto do so. She would therefore be placed at the mercy of a son-in-law.Though she might be able to control Paul if left to himself, would he,when enlightened by his notary, agree to release her from rendering heraccount as guardian of her daughter\'s patrimony? If Paul withdrewhis proposals all Bordeaux would know the reason and Natalie\'s futuremarriage would be made impossible. This mother, who desired thehappiness of her daughter, this woman, who from infancy had livedhonorably, was aware that on the morrow she must become dishonest. Likethose great warriors who fain would blot from their lives the momentwhen they had felt a secret cowardice, she ardently desired to cut thisinevitable day from the record of hers. Most assuredly some hairs on herhead must have whitened during the night, when, face to face with facts,she bitterly regretted her extravagance as she felt the hard necessitiesof the situation.Among these necessities was that of confiding the truth to her notary,for whom she sent in the morning as soon as she rose. She was forced toreveal to him a secret defaulting she had never been willing to admitto herself, for she had steadily advanced to the abyss, relying on somechance accident, which never happened, to relieve her. There rose in hersoul a feeling against Paul, that was neither dislike, nor aversion,nor anything, as yet, unkind; but HE was the cause of this crisis; theopposing party in this secret suit; he became, without knowing it, aninnocent enemy she was forced to conquer. What human being did ever yetlove his or her dupe? Compelled to deceive and trick him if she could,the Spanish woman resolved, like other women, to put her whole force ofcharacter into the struggle, the dishonor of which could be absolved byvictory only.In the stillness of the night she excused her conduct to her own mindby a tissue of arguments in which her pride predominated. Natalie hadshared the benefit of her extravagance. There was not a single base orignoble motive in what she had done. She was no accountant, but was thata crime, a delinquency? A man was only too lucky to obtain a wife likeNatalie without a penny. Such a treasure bestowed upon him might surelyrelease her from a guardianship account. How many men had bought thewomen they loved by greater sacrifices? Why should a man do less fora wife than for a mistress? Besides, Paul was a nullity, a man of noforce, incapable; she would spend the best resources of her mind uponhim and open to him a fine career; he should owe his future power andposition to her influence; in that way she could pay her debt. He wouldindeed be a fool to refuse such a future; and for what? a few paltrythousands, more or less. He would be infamous if he withdrew for such areason.""But,"" she added, to herself, ""if the negotiation does not succeedat once, I shall leave Bordeaux. I can still find a good marriage forNatalie by investing the proceeds of what is left, house and diamondsand furniture,--keeping only a small income for myself.""When a strong soul constructs a way of ultimate escape,--as Richelieudid at Brouage,--and holds in reserve a vigorous end, the resolutionbecomes a lever which strengthens its immediate way. The thought of thisfinale in case of failure comforted Madame Evangelista, who fell asleepwith all the more confidence as she remembered her assistance in thecoming duel.This was a young man named Solonet, considered the ablest notary inBordeaux; now twenty-seven years of age and decorated with the Legionof honor for having actively contributed to the second return ofthe Bourbons. Proud and happy to be received in the home of MadameEvangelista, less as a notary than as belonging to the royalist societyof Bordeaux, Solonet had conceived for that fine setting sun one ofthose passions which women like Madame Evangelista repulse, althoughflattered and graciously allowing them to exist upon the surface.Solonet remained therefore in a self-satisfied condition of hope andbecoming respect. Being sent for, he arrived the next morning with thepromptitude of a slave and was received by the coquettish widow inher bedroom, where she allowed him to find her in a very becomingdishabille.""Can I,"" she said, ""count upon your discretion and your entire devotionin a discussion which will take place in my house this evening? You willreadily understand that it relates to the marriage of my daughter.""The young man expended himself in gallant protestations.""Now to the point,"" she said.""I am listening,"" he replied, checking his ardor.Madame Evangelista then stated her position baldly.""My dear lady, that is nothing to be troubled about,"" said MaitreSolonet, assuming a confident air as soon as his client had given himthe exact figures. ""The question is how have you conducted yourselftoward Monsieur de Manerville? In this matter questions of manner anddeportment are of greater importance than those of law and finance.""Madame Evangelista wrapped herself in dignity. The notary learned tohis satisfaction that until the present moment his client\'s relationsto Paul had been distant and reserved, and that partly from native prideand partly from involuntary shrewdness she had treated the Comte deManerville as in some sense her inferior and as though it were an honorfor him to be allowed to marry Mademoiselle Evangelista. She assuredSolonet that neither she nor her daughter could be suspected of anymercenary interests in the marriage; that they had the right, shouldPaul make any financial difficulties, to retreat from the affair to anillimitable distance; and finally, that she had already acquired overher future son-in-law a very remarkable ascendancy.""If that is so,"" said Solonet, ""tell me what are the utmost concessionsyou are willing to make.""""I wish to make as few as possible,"" she answered, laughing.""A woman\'s answer,"" cried Solonet. ""Madame, are you anxious to marryMademoiselle Natalie?""""Yes.""""And you want a receipt for the eleven hundred and fifty-six thousandfrancs, for which you are responsible on the guardianship account whichthe law obliges you to render to your son-in-law?""""Yes.""""How much do you want to keep back?""""Thirty thousand a year, at least.""""It is a question of conquer or die, is it?""""It is.""""Well, then, I must reflect on the necessary means to that end; itwill need all our cleverness to manage our forces. I will give you someinstructions on my arrival this evening; follow them carefully, and Ithink I may promise you a successful issue. Is the Comte de Manervillein love with Mademoiselle Natalie?"" he asked as he rose to take leave.""He adores her.""""That is not enough. Does he desire her to the point of disregarding allpecuniary difficulties?""""Yes.""""That\'s what I call having a lien upon a daughter\'s property,"" cried thenotary. ""Make her look her best to-night,"" he added with a sly glance.""She has a most charming dress for the occasion.""""The marriage-contract dress is, in my opinion, half the battle,"" saidSolonet.This last argument seemed so cogent to Madame Evangelista that shesuperintended Natalie\'s toilet herself, as much perhaps to watchher daughter as to make her the innocent accomplice of her financialconspiracy.With her hair dressed a la Sevigne and wearing a gown of white tulleadorned with pink ribbons, Natalie seemed to her mother so beautifulas to guarantee victory. When the lady\'s-maid left the room and MadameEvangelista was certain that no one could overhear her, she arranged afew curls on her daughter\'s head by way of exordium.""Dear child,"" she said, in a voice that was firm apparently, ""do yousincerely love the Comte de Manerville?""Mother and daughter cast strange looks at each other.""Why do you ask that question, little mother? and to-day more thanyesterday. Why have you thrown me with him?""""If you and I had to part forever would you still persist in themarriage?""""I should give it up--and I should not die of grief.""""You do not love him, my dear,"" said the mother, kissing her daughter\'sforehead.""But why, my dear mother, are you playing the Grand Inquisitor?""""I wished to know if you desired the marriage without being madly inlove with the husband.""""I love him.""""And you are right. He is a count; we will make him a peer of Francebetween us; nevertheless, there are certain difficulties.""""Difficulties between persons who love each other? Oh, no. The heart ofthe Pink of Fashion is too firmly planted here,"" she said, with a prettygesture, ""to make the very slightest objection. I am sure of that.""""But suppose it were otherwise?"" persisted Madame Evangelista.""He would be profoundly and forever forgotten,"" replied Natalie.""Good! You are a Casa-Reale. But suppose, though he madly loves you,suppose certain discussions and difficulties should arise, not of hisown making, but which he must decide in your interests as well as inmine--hey, Natalie, what then? Without lowering your dignity, perhaps alittle softness in your manner might decide him--a word, a tone, a merenothing. Men are so made; they resist a serious argument, but they yieldto a tender look.""""I understand! a little touch to make my Favori leap the barrier,"" saidNatalie, making the gesture of striking a horse with her whip.""My darling! I ask nothing that resembles seduction. You and I havesentiments of the old Castilian honor which will never permit us to passcertain limits. Count Paul shall know our situation.""""What situation?""""You would not understand it. But I tell you now that if after seeingyou in all your glory his look betrays the slightest hesitation,--and Ishall watch him,--on that instant I shall break off the marriage; I willliquidate my property, leave Bordeaux, and go to Douai, to be near theClaes. Madame Claes is our relation through the Temnincks. Then I\'llmarry you to a peer of France, and take refuge in a convent myself, thatI may give up to you my whole fortune.""""Mother, what am I to do to prevent such misfortunes?"" cried Natalie.""I have never seen you so beautiful as you are now,"" replied her mother.""Be a little coquettish, and all is well.""Madame Evangelista left Natalie to her thoughts, and went to arrangeher own toilet in such a way that would bear comparison with that of herdaughter. If Natalie ought to make herself attractive to Paul she ought,none the less, to inflame the ardor of her champion Solonet. The motherand daughter were therefore under arms when Paul arrived, bearing thebouquet which for the last few months he had daily offered to hislove. All three conversed pleasantly while awaiting the arrival of thenotaries.This day brought to Paul the first skirmish of that long and wearisomewarfare called marriage. It is therefore necessary to state the forceson both sides, the position of the belligerent bodies, and the ground onwhich they are about to manoeuvre.To maintain a struggle, the importance of which had wholly escaped him,Paul\'s only auxiliary was the old notary, Mathias. Both were about to beconfronted, unaware and defenceless, by a most unexpected circumstance;to be pressed by an enemy whose strategy was planned, and driven todecide on a course without having time to reflect upon it. Where isthe man who would not have succumbed, even though assisted by Cujas andBarthole? How should he look for deceit and treachery where all seemedcompliant and natural? What could old Mathias do alone against MadameEvangelista, against Solonet, against Natalie, especially when a clientin love goes over to the enemy as soon as the rising conflict threatenshis happiness? Already Paul was damaging his cause by making thecustomary lover\'s speeches, to which his passion gave excessive valuein the ears of Madame Evangelista, whose object it was to drive him tocommit himself.The matrimonial condottieri now about to fight for their clients,whose personal powers were to be so vitally important in this solemnencounter, the two notaries, on short, represent individually the oldand the new systems,--old fashioned notarial usage, and the new-fangledmodern procedure.Maitre Mathias was a worthy old gentleman sixty-nine years of age, whotook great pride in his forty years\' exercise of the profession. Hishuge gouty feet were encased in shoes with silver buckles, making aridiculous termination to legs so spindling, with knees so bony, thatwhen he crossed them they made you think of the emblems on a tombstone.His puny little thighs, lost in a pair of wide black breeches fastenedwith buckles, seemed to bend beneath the weight of a round stomach anda torso developed, like that of most sedentary persons, into a stoutbarrel, always buttoned into a green coat with square tails, which noman could remember to have ever seen new. His hair, well brushed andpowdered, was tied in a rat\'s tail that lay between the collar of hiscoat and that of his waistcoat, which was white, with a pattern offlowers. With his round head, his face the color of a vine-leaf, hisblue eyes, a trumpet nose, a thick-lipped mouth, and a double-chin, thedear old fellow excited, whenever he appeared among strangers who didnot know him, that satirical laugh which Frenchmen so generously bestowon the ludicrous creations Dame Nature occasionally allows herself,which Art delights in exaggerating under the name of caricatures.But in Maitre Mathias, mind had triumphed over form; the qualities ofhis soul had vanquished the oddities of his body. The inhabitants ofBordeaux, as a rule, testified a friendly respect and a deference thatwas full of esteem for him. The old man\'s voice went to their hearts andsounded there with the eloquence of uprightness. His craft consisted ingoing straight to the fact, overturning all subterfuge and evil devicesby plain questionings. His quick perception, his long training in hisprofession gave him that divining sense which goes to the depths ofconscience and reads its secret thoughts. Though grave and deliberate inbusiness, the patriarch could be gay with the gaiety of our ancestors.He could risk a song after dinner, enjoy all family festivities,celebrate the birthdays of grandmothers and children, and bury with duesolemnity the Christmas log. He loved to send presents at New Year,and eggs at Easter; he believed in the duties of a godfather, and neverdeserted the customs which colored the life of the olden time. MaitreMathias was a noble and venerable relic of the notaries, obscuregreat men, who gave no receipt for the millions entrusted to them, butreturned those millions in the sacks they were delivered in, tied withthe same twine; men who fulfilled their trusts to the letter, drewhonest inventories, took fatherly interest in their clients, oftenbarring the way to extravagance and dissipation,--men to whom familiesconfided their secrets, and who felt so responsible for any error intheir deeds that they meditated long and carefully over them. Neverduring his whole notarial life, had any client found reason to complainof a bad investment or an ill-placed mortgage. His own fortune, slowlybut honorably acquired, had come to him as the result of a thirty years\'practice and careful economy. He had established in life fourteen of hisclerks. Religious, and generous in secret, Mathias was found whenevergood was to be done without remuneration. An active member on hospitaland other benevolent committees, he subscribed the largest sums torelieve all sudden misfortunes and emergencies, as well as to createcertain useful permanent institutions; consequently, neither he norhis wife kept a carriage. Also his word was felt to be sacred, and hiscoffers held as much of the money of others as a bank; and also, we mayadd, he went by the name of ""Our good Monsieur Mathias,"" and when hedied, three thousand persons followed him to his grave.Solonet was the style of young notary who comes in humming a tune,affects light-heartedness, declares that business is better done witha laugh than seriously. He is the notary captain of the national guard,who dislikes to be taken for a notary, solicits the cross of the Legionof honor, keeps his cabriolet, and leaves the verification of his deedsto his clerks; he is the notary who goes to balls and theatres, buyspictures and plays at ecarte; he has coffers in which gold is receivedon deposit and is later returned in bank-bills,--a notary who followshis epoch, risks capital in doubtful investments, speculates with allhe can lay his hands on, and expects to retire with an income of thirtythousand francs after ten years\' practice; in short, the notary whosecleverness comes of his duplicity, whom many men fear as an accomplicepossessing their secrets, and who sees in his practice a means ofultimately marrying some blue-stockinged heiress.When the slender, fair-haired Solonet, curled, perfumed, and booted likethe leading gentleman at the Vaudeville, and dressed like a dandy whosemost important business is a duel, entered Madame Evangelista\'s salon,preceding his brother notary, whose advance was delayed by a twingeof the gout, the two men presented to the life one of those famouscaricatures entitled ""Former Times and the Present Day,"" which had sucheminent success under the Empire. If Madame and Mademoiselle Evangelistato whom the ""good Monsieur Mathias,"" was personally unknown, felt, onfirst seeing him, a slight inclination to laugh, they were soon touchedby the old-fashioned grace with which he greeted them. The words he usedwere full of that amenity which amiable old men convey as much by theideas they suggest as by the manner in which they express them. Theyounger notary, with his flippant tone, seemed on a lower plane. Mathiasshowed his superior knowledge of life by the reserved manner with whichhe accosted Paul. Without compromising his white hairs, he showed thathe respected the young man\'s nobility, while at the same time he claimedthe honor due to old age, and made it felt that social rights arenatural. Solonet\'s bow and greeting, on the contrary, expressed a senseof perfect equality, which would naturally affront the pretensions ofa man of society and make the notary ridiculous in the eyes of areal noble. Solonet made a motion, somewhat too familiar, to MadameEvangelista, inviting her to a private conference in the recess ofa window. For some minutes they talked to each other in a low voice,giving way now and then to laughter,--no doubt to lessen in the minds ofothers the importance of the conversation, in which Solonet was reallycommunicating to his sovereign lady the plan of battle.""But,"" he said, as he ended, ""will you have the courage to sell yourhouse?""""Undoubtedly,"" she replied.Madame Evangelista did not choose to tell her notary the motive of thisheroism, which struck him greatly. Solonet\'s zeal might have cooled hadhe known that his client was really intending to leave Bordeaux. She hadnot as yet said anything about that intention to Paul, in order not toalarm him with the preliminary steps and circumlocutions which must betaken before he entered on the political life she planned for him.After dinner the two plenipotentiaries left the loving pair withthe mother, and betook themselves to an adjoining salon where theirconference was arranged to take place. A dual scene then followed onthis domestic stage: in the chimney-corner of the great salon a scene oflove, in which to all appearances life was smiles and joy; in the otherroom, a scene of gravity and gloom, where selfish interests, baldlyproclaimed, openly took the part they play in life under flowerydisguises.""My dear master,"" said Solonet, ""the document can remain under your lockand key; I know very well what I owe to my old preceptor."" Mathias bowedgravely. ""But,"" continued Solonet, unfolding the rough copy of a deed hehad made his clerk draw up, ""as we are the oppressed party, I mean thedaughter, I have written the contract--which will save you trouble. Wemarry with our rights under the rule of community of interests; withgeneral donation of our property to each other in case of death withoutheirs; if not, donation of one-fourth as life interest, and one-fourthin fee; the sum placed in community of interests to be one-fourth of therespective property of each party; the survivor to possess the furniturewithout appraisal. It\'s all as simple as how d\'ye do.""""Ta, ta, ta, ta,"" said Mathias, ""I don\'t do business as one sings atune. What are your claims?""""What are yours?"" said Solonet.""Our property,"" replied Mathias, ""is: the estate of Lanstrac, whichbrings in a rental of twenty-three thousand francs a year, not countingthe natural products. Item: the farms of Grassol and Guadet, eachworth three thousand six hundred francs a year. Item: the vineyard ofBelle-Rose, yielding in ordinary years sixteen thousand francs; total,forty-six thousand two hundred francs a year. Item: the patrimonialmansion at Bordeaux taxed for nine hundred francs. Item: a handsomehouse, between court and garden in Paris, rue de la Pepiniere, taxedfor fifteen hundred francs. These pieces of property, the title-deeds ofwhich I hold, are derived from our father and mother, except thehouse in Paris, which we bought ourselves. We must also reckon inthe furniture of the two houses, and that of the chateau of Lanstrac,estimated at four hundred and fifty thousand francs. There\'s the table,the cloth, and the first course. What do you bring for the second courseand the dessert?""""Our rights,"" replied Solonet.""Specify them, my friend,"" said Mathias. ""What do you bring us? Where isthe inventory of the property left by Monsieur Evangelista? Show me theliquidation, the investment of the amount. Where is your capital?--ifthere is any capital. Where is your landed property?--if you have any.In short, let us see your guardianship account, and tell us what youbring and what your mother will secure to us.""""Does Monsieur le Comte de Manerville love Mademoiselle Evangelista?""""He wishes to make her his wife if the marriage can be suitablyarranged,"" said the old notary. ""I am not a child; this matter concernsour business, and not our feelings.""""The marriage will be off unless you show generous feeling; and for thisreason,"" continued Solonet. ""No inventory was made at the death of ourhusband; we are Spaniards, Creoles, and know nothing of French laws.Besides, we were too deeply grieved at our loss to think at such a timeof the miserable formalities which occupy cold hearts. It is publiclywell known that our late husband adored us, and that we mourned forhim sincerely. If we did have a settlement of accounts with a shortinventory attached, made, as one may say, by common report, you canthank our surrogate guardian, who obliged us to establish a status andassign to our daughter a fortune, such as it is, at a time when we wereforced to withdraw from London our English securities, the capital ofwhich was immense, and re-invest the proceeds in Paris, where interestswere doubled.""""Don\'t talk nonsense to me. There are various ways of verifying theproperty. What was the amount of your legacy tax? Those figures willenable us to get at the total. Come to the point. Tell us frankly whatyou received from the father\'s estate and how much remains of it. If weare very much in love we\'ll see then what we can do.""""If you are marrying us for our money you can go about your business. Wehave claims to more than a million; but all that remains to our motheris this house and furniture and four hundred odd thousand francsinvested about 1817 in the Five-per-cents, which yield aboutforty-thousand francs a year.""""Then why do you live in a style that requires one hundred thousand ayear at the least?"" cried Mathias, horror-stricken.""Our daughter has cost us the eyes out of our head,"" replied Solonet.""Besides, we like to spend money. Your jeremiads, let me tell you, won\'trecover two farthings of the money.""""With the fifty thousand francs a year which belong to MademoiselleNatalie you could have brought her up handsomely without coming to ruin.But if you have squandered everything while you were a girl what will itbe when you are a married woman?""""Then drop us altogether,"" said Solonet. ""The handsomest girl inBordeaux has a right to spend more than she has, if she likes.""""I\'ll talk to my client about that,"" said the old notary.""Very good, old father Cassandra, go and tell your client that wehaven\'t a penny,"" thought Solonet, who, in the solitude of his study,had strategically massed his forces, drawn up his propositions, mannedthe drawbridge of discussion, and prepared the point at which theopposing party, thinking the affair a failure, could suddenly be ledinto a compromise which would end in the triumph of his client.The white dress with its rose-colored ribbons, the Sevigne curls,Natalie\'s tiny foot, her winning glance, her pretty fingers constantlyemployed in adjusting curls that needed no adjustment, these girlishmanoeuvres like those of a peacock spreading his tail, had brought Paulto the point at which his future mother-in-law desired to see him. Hewas intoxicated with love, and his eyes, the sure thermometer of thesoul, indicated the degree of passion at which a man commits a thousandfollies.""Natalie is so beautiful,"" he whispered to the mother, ""that I canconceive the frenzy which leads a man to pay for his happiness bydeath.""Madame Evangelista replied with a shake of her head:--""Lover\'s talk, my dear count. My husband never said such charming thingsto me; but he married me without a fortune and for thirteen years henever caused me one moment\'s pain.""""Is that a lesson you are giving me?"" said Paul, laughing.""You know how I love you, my dear son,"" she answered, pressing his hand.""I must indeed love you well to give you my Natalie.""""Give me, give me?"" said the young girl, waving a screen of Indianfeathers, ""what are you whispering about me?""""I was telling her,"" replied Paul, ""how much I love you, since etiquetteforbids me to tell it to you.""""Why?""""I fear to say too much.""""Ah! you know too well how to offer the jewels of flattery. Shall I tellyou my private opinion about you? Well, I think you have more mind thana lover ought to have. To be the Pink of Fashion and a wit as well,"" sheadded, dropping her eyes, ""is to have too many advantages: a man shouldchoose between them. I fear too, myself.""""And why?""""We must not talk in this way. Mamma, do you not think that thisconversation is dangerous inasmuch as the contract is not yet signed?""""It soon will be,"" said Paul.""I should like to know what Achilles and Nestor are saying to each otherin the next room,"" said Natalie, nodding toward the door of the littlesalon with a childlike expression of curiosity.""They are talking of our children and our death and a lot of other suchtrifles; they are counting our gold to see if we can keep five horses inthe stables. They are talking also of deeds of gift; but there, I haveforestalled them.""""How so?""""Have I not given myself wholly to you?"" he said, looking straight atthe girl, whose beauty was enhanced by the blush which the pleasure ofthis answer brought to her face.""Mamma, how can I acknowledge so much generosity.""""My dear child, you have a lifetime before you in which to return it.To make the daily happiness of a home, is to bring a treasure into it. Ihad no other fortune when I married.""""Do you like Lanstrac?"" asked Paul, addressing Natalie.""How could I fail to like the place where you were born?"" she answered.""I wish I could see your house.""""_Our_ house,"" said Paul. ""Do you not want to know if I shall understandyour tastes and arrange the house to suit you? Your mother had made ahusband\'s task most difficult; you have always been so happy! But wherelove is infinite, nothing is impossible.""""My dear children,"" said Madame Evangelista, ""do you feel willing tostay in Bordeaux after your marriage? If you have the courage to facethe people here who know you and will watch and hamper you, so be it!But if you feel that desire for a solitude together which can hardly beexpressed, let us go to Paris were the life of a young couple can passunnoticed in the stream. There alone you can behave as lovers withoutfearing to seem ridiculous.""""You are quite right,"" said Paul, ""but I shall hardly have time to getmy house ready. However, I will write to-night to de Marsay, the friendon whom I can always count to get things done for me.""At the moment when Paul, like all young men accustomed to satisfytheir desires without previous calculation, was inconsiderately bindinghimself to the expenses of a stay in Paris, Maitre Mathias entered thesalon and made a sign to his client that he wished to speak to him.""What is it, my friend?"" asked Paul, following the old man to the recessof a window.""Monsieur le comte,"" said the honest lawyer, ""there is not a penny ofdowry. My advice is: put off the conference to another day, so that youmay gain time to consider your proper course.""""Monsieur Paul,"" said Natalie, ""I have a word to say in private to you.""Though Madame Evangelista\'s face was calm, no Jew of the middle agesever suffered greater torture in his caldron of boiling oil than she wasenduring in her violet velvet gown. Solonet had pledged the marriage toher, but she was ignorant of the means and conditions of success. Theanguish of this uncertainty was intolerable. Possibly she owed hersafety to her daughter\'s disobedience. Natalie had considered the adviceof her mother and noted her anxiety. When she saw the success of herown coquetry she was struck to the heart with a variety of contradictorythoughts. Without blaming her mother, she was half-ashamed of manoeuvresthe object of which was, undoubtedly, some personal game. She was alsoseized with a jealous curiosity which is easily conceived. She wanted tofind out if Paul loved her well enough to rise above the obstacles thather mother foresaw and which she now saw clouding the face of the oldlawyer. These ideas and sentiments prompted her to an action of loyaltywhich became her well. But, for all that, the blackest perfidy could nothave been as dangerous as her present innocence.""Paul,"" she said in a low voice, and she so called him for the firsttime, ""if any difficulties as to property arise to separate us, rememberthat I free you from all engagements, and will allow you to let theblame of such a rupture rest on me.""She put such dignity into this expression of her generosity that Paulbelieved in her disinterestedness and in her ignorance of the strangefact that his notary had just told to him. He pressed the young girl\'shand and kissed it like a man to whom love is more precious than wealth.Natalie left the room.""Sac-a-papier! Monsieur le comte, you are committing a great folly,""said the old notary, rejoining his client.Paul grew thoughtful. He had expected to unite Natalie\'s fortune withhis own and thus obtain for his married life an income of one hundredthousand francs a year; and however much a man may be in love he cannotpass without emotion and anxiety from the prospect of a hundred thousandto the certainty of forty-six thousand a year and the duty of providingfor a woman accustomed to every luxury.""My daughter is no longer here,"" said Madame Evangelista, advancingalmost regally toward her son-in-law and his notary. ""May I be told whatis happening?""""Madame,"" replied Mathias, alarmed at Paul\'s silence, ""an obstacle whichI fear will delay us has arisen--""At these words, Maitre Solonet issued from the little salon and cutshort the old man\'s speech by a remark which restored Paul\'s composure.Overcome by the remembrance of his gallant speeches and his lover-likebehavior, he felt unable to disown them or to change his course. Helonged, for the moment, to fling himself into a gulf; Solonet\'s wordsrelieved him.""There is a way,"" said the younger notary, with an easy air, ""bywhich madame can meet the payment which is due to her daughter. MadameEvangelista possesses forty thousand francs a year from an investmentin the Five-per-cents, the capital of which will soon be at par, if notabove it. We may therefore reckon it at eight hundred thousand francs.This house and garden are fully worth two hundred thousand. On thatestimate, Madame can convey by the marriage contract the titles of thatproperty to her daughter, reserving only a life interest in it--forI conclude that Monsieur le comte could hardly wish to leave hismother-in-law without means? Though Madame has certainly run through herfortune, she is still able to make good that of her daughter, or verynearly so.""""Women are most unfortunate in having no knowledge of business,""said Madame Evangelista. ""Have I titles to property? and what arelife-interests?""Paul was in a sort of ecstasy as he listened to this proposedarrangement. The old notary, seeing the trap, and his client with onefoot caught in it, was petrified for a moment, as he said to himself:--""I am certain they are tricking us.""""If madame will follow my advice,"" said Solonet, ""she will secure herown tranquillity. By sacrificing herself in this way she may be surethat no minors will ultimately harass her--for we never know whomay live and who may die! Monsieur le comte will then give dueacknowledgment in the marriage contract of having received the sum totalof Mademoiselle Evangelista\'s patrimonial inheritance.""Mathias could not restrain the indignation which shone in his eyes andflushed his face.""And that sum,"" he said, shaking, ""is--""""One million, one hundred and fifty-six thousand francs according to thedocument--""""Why don\'t you ask Monsieur le comte to make over \'hic et nunc\' hiswhole fortune to his future wife?"" said Mathias. ""It would be morehonest than what you now propose. I will not allow the ruin of the Comtede Manerville to take place under my very eyes--""He made a step as if to address his client, who was silent throughoutthis scene as if dazed by it; but he turned and said, addressing MadameEvangelista:--""Do not suppose, madame, that I think you a party to these ideas ofmy brother notary. I consider you an honest woman and a lady who knowsnothing of business.""""Thank you, brother notary,"" said Solonet.""You know that there can be no offence between you and me,"" repliedMathias. ""Madame,"" he added, ""you ought to know the result of thisproposed arrangement. You are still young and beautiful enough to marryagain--Ah! madame,"" said the old man, noting her gesture, ""who cananswer for themselves on that point?""""I did not suppose, monsieur,"" said Madame Evangelista, ""that, afterremaining a widow for the seven best years of my life, and refusing themost brilliant offers for my daughter\'s sake, I should be suspected ofsuch a piece of folly as marrying again at thirty-nine years of age.If we were not talking business I should regard your suggestion as animpertinence.""""Would it not be more impertinent if I suggested that you could notmarry again?""""Can and will are separate terms,"" remarked Solonet, gallantly.""Well,"" resumed Maitre Mathias, ""we will say nothing of your marriage.You may, and we all desire it, live for forty-five years to come. Now,if you keep for yourself the life-interest in your daughter\'s patrimony,your children are laid on the shelf for the best years of their lives.""""What does that mean?"" said the widow. ""I don\'t understand being laid ona shelf.""Solonet, the man of elegance and good taste, began to laugh.""I\'ll translate it for you,"" said Mathias. ""If your children are wisethey will think of the future. To think of the future means laying byhalf our income, provided we have only two children, to whom we arebound to give a fine education and a handsome dowry. Your daughter andson-in-law will, therefore, be reduced to live on twenty thousand francsa year, though each has spent fifty thousand while still unmarried. Butthat is nothing. The law obliges my client to account, hereafter, to hischildren for the eleven hundred and fifty-six thousand francs of theirmother\'s patrimony; yet he may not have received them if his wife shoulddie and madame should survive her, which may very well happen. To signsuch a contract is to fling one\'s self into the river, bound hand andfoot. You wish to make your daughter happy, do you not? If she loves herhusband, a fact which notaries never doubt, she will share his troubles.Madame, I see enough in this scheme to make her die of grief andanxiety; you are consigning her to poverty. Yes, madame, poverty; topersons accustomed to the use of one hundred thousand francs a year,twenty thousand is poverty. Moreover, if Monsieur le comte, out oflove for his wife, were guilty of extravagance, she could ruin him byexercising her rights when misfortunes overtook him. I plead now foryou, for them, for their children, for every one.""""The old fellow makes a lot of smoke with his cannon,"" thought MaitreSolonet, giving his client a look, which meant, ""Keep on!""""There is one way of combining all interests,"" replied MadameEvangelista, calmly. ""I can reserve to myself only the necessary cost ofliving in a convent, and my children can have my property at once. I canrenounce the world, if such anticipated death conduces to the welfare ofmy daughter.""""Madame,"" said the old notary, ""let us take time to consider andweigh, deliberately, the course we had best pursue to conciliate allinterests.""""Good heavens! monsieur,"" cried Madame Evangelista, who saw defeatin delay, ""everything has already been considered and weighed. I wasignorant of what the process of marriage is in France; I am a Spaniardand a Creole. I did not know that in order to marry my daughter it wasnecessary to reckon up the days which God may still grant me; that mychild would suffer because I live; that I do harm by living, and byhaving lived! When my husband married me I had nothing but my name andmy person. My name alone was a fortune to him, which dwarfed his own.What wealth can equal that of a great name? My dowry was beauty,virtue, happiness, birth, education. Can money give those treasures?If Natalie\'s father could overhear this conversation, his generous soulwould be wounded forever, and his happiness in paradise destroyed. Idissipated, foolishly, perhaps, a few of his millions without a quiverever coming to his eyelids. Since his death, I have grown economical andorderly in comparison with the life he encouraged me to lead--Come, letus break this thing off! Monsieur de Manerville is so disappointed thatI--""No descriptive language can express the confusion and shock which thewords, ""break off,"" introduced into the conversation. It is enough tosay that these four apparently well-bred persons all talked at once.""In Spain people marry in the Spanish fashion, or as they please; butin France they marry according to French law, sensibly, and as best theycan,"" said Mathias.""Ah, madame,"" cried Paul, coming out of his stupefaction, ""you mistakemy feelings.""""This is not a matter of feeling,"" said the old notary, trying to stophis client from concessions. ""We are concerned now with the interestsand welfare of three generations. Have _we_ wasted the missing millions?We are simply endeavoring to solve difficulties of which we are whollyguiltless.""""Marry us, and don\'t haggle,"" said Solonet.""Haggle! do you call it haggling to defend the interests of father andmother and children?"" said Mathias.""Yes,"" said Paul, continuing his remarks to Madame Evangelista, ""Ideplore the extravagance of my youth, which does not permit me to stopthis discussion, as you deplore your ignorance of business and yourinvoluntary wastefulness. God is my witness that I am not thinking, atthis moment, of myself. A simple life at Lanstrac does not alarm me; buthow can I ask Mademoiselle Natalie to renounce her tastes, her habits?Her very existence would be changed.""""Where did Evangelista get his millions?"" said the widow.""Monsieur Evangelista was in business,"" replied the old notary; ""heplayed in the great game of commerce; he despatched ships and madeenormous sums; we are simply a landowner, whose capital is invested,whose income is fixed.""""There is still a way to harmonize all interests,"" said Solonet,uttering this sentence in a high falsetto tone, which silenced the otherthree and drew their eyes and their attention upon himself.This young man was not unlike a skilful coachman who holds the reins offour horses, and amuses himself by first exciting his animals and thensubduing them. He had let loose these passions, and then, in turn, hecalmed them, making Paul, whose life and happiness were in the balance,sweat in his harness, as well as his own client, who could not clearlysee her way through this involved discussion.""Madame Evangelista,"" he continued, after a slight pause, ""can resignher investment in the Five-per-cents at once, and she can sell thishouse. I can get three hundred thousand francs for it by cutting theland into small lots. Out of that sum she can give you one hundred andfifty thousand francs. In this way she pays down nine hundred thousandof her daughter\'s patrimony, immediately. That, to be sure, is not allthat she owes her daughter, but where will you find, in France, a betterdowry?""""Very good,"" said Maitre Mathias; ""but what, then, becomes of madame?""At this question, which appeared to imply consent, Solonet said, softly,to himself, ""Well done, old fox! I\'ve caught you!""""Madame,"" he replied, aloud, ""will keep the hundred and fifty thousandfrancs remaining from the sale of the house. This sum, added to thevalue of her furniture, can be invested in an annuity which will giveher twenty thousand francs a year. Monsieur le comte can arrange toprovide a residence for her under his roof. Lanstrac is a large house.You have also a house in Paris,"" he went on, addressing himself to Paul.""Madame can, therefore, live with you wherever you are. A widow withtwenty thousand francs a year, and no household to maintain, is richerthan madame was when she possessed her whole fortune. Madame Evangelistahas only this one daughter; Monsieur le comte is without relations; itwill be many years before your heirs attain their majority; no conflictof interests is, therefore, to be feared. A mother-in-law and ason-in-law placed in such relations will form a household of unitedinterests. Madame Evangelista can make up for the remaining deficit bypaying a certain sum for her support from her annuity, which will easeyour way. We know that madame is too generous and too large-minded tobe willing to be a burden on her children. In this way you can make onehousehold, united and happy, and be able to spend, in your own right,one hundred thousand francs a year. Is not that sum sufficient, Monsieurle comte, to enjoy, in all countries, the luxuries of life, and tosatisfy all your wants and caprices? Believe me, a young couple oftenfeel the need of a third member of the household; and, I ask you, whatthird member could be so desirable as a good mother?""""A little paradise!"" exclaimed the old notary.Shocked to see his client\'s joy at this proposal, Mathias sat down onan ottoman, his head in his hands, plunged in reflections that wereevidently painful. He knew well the involved phraseology in whichnotaries and lawyers wrap up, intentionally, malicious schemes, and hewas not the man to be taken in by it. He now began, furtively, to watchhis brother notary and Madame Evangelista as they conversed withPaul, endeavoring to detect some clew to the deep-laid plot which wasbeginning to appear upon the surface.""Monsieur,"" said Paul to Solonet, ""I thank you for the pains you take toconciliate our interests. This arrangement will solve all difficultiesfar more happily than I expected--if,"" he added, turning to MadameEvangelista, ""it is agreeable to you, madame; for I could not desireanything that did not equally please you.""""I?"" she said; ""all that makes the happiness of my children is joy tome. Do not consider me in any way.""""That would not be right,"" said Paul, eagerly. ""If your future is nothonorably provided for, Natalie and I would suffer more than you wouldsuffer for yourself.""""Don\'t be uneasy, Monsieur le comte,"" interposed Solonet.""Ah!"" thought old Mathias, ""they\'ll make him kiss the rod before theyscourge him.""""You may feel quite satisfied,"" continued Solonet. ""There are so manyenterprises going on in Bordeaux at this moment that investments forannuities can be negotiated on very advantageous terms. After deductingfrom the proceeds of the house and furniture the hundred and fiftythousand francs we owe you, I think I can guarantee to madame that twohundred and fifty thousand will remain to her. I take upon myself toinvest that sum in a first mortgage on property worth a million, andto obtain ten per cent for it,--twenty-five thousand francs a year.Consequently, we are marrying on nearly equal fortunes. In fact, againstyour forty-six thousand francs a year, Mademoiselle Natalie brings youforty thousand a year in the Five-per-cents, and one hundred and fiftythousand in a round sum, which gives, in all, forty-seven thousandfrancs a year.""""That is evident,"" said Paul.As he ended his speech, Solonet had cast a sidelong glance at hisclient, intercepted by Mathias, which meant: ""Bring up your reserves.""""But,"" exclaimed Madame Evangelista, in tones of joy that did not seemto be feigned, ""I can give Natalie my diamonds; they are worth, atleast, a hundred thousand francs.""""We can have them appraised,"" said the notary. ""This will change thewhole face of things. Madame can then keep the proceeds of her house,all but fifty thousand francs. Nothing will prevent Monsieur le comtefrom giving us a receipt in due form, as having received, in full,Mademoiselle Natalie\'s inheritance from her father; this will close, ofcourse, the guardianship account. If madame, with Spanish generosity,robs herself in this way to fulfil her obligations, the least that herchildren can do is to give her a full receipt.""""Nothing could be more just than that,"" said Paul. ""I am simplyoverwhelmed by these generous proposals.""""My daughter is another myself,"" said Madame Evangelista, softly.Maitre Mathias detected a look of joy on her face when she saw thatthe difficulties were being removed: that joy, and the previousforgetfulness of the diamonds, which were now brought forward like freshtroops, confirmed his suspicions.""The scene has been prepared between them as gamblers prepare the cardsto ruin a pigeon,"" thought the old notary. ""Is this poor boy, whom Isaw born, doomed to be plucked alive by that woman, roasted by his verylove, and devoured by his wife? I, who have nursed these fine estatesfor years with such care, am I to see them ruined in a single night?Three million and a half to be hypothecated for eleven hundred thousandfrancs these women will force him to squander!""Discovering thus in the soul of the elder woman intentions which,without involving crime, theft, swindling, or any actually evil orblameworthy action, nevertheless belonged to all those criminalities inembryo, Maitre Mathias felt neither sorrow nor generous indignation.He was not the Misanthrope; he was an old notary, accustomed in hisbusiness to the shrewd calculations of worldly people, to those cleverbits of treachery which do more fatal injury than open murder onthe high-road committed by some poor devil, who is guillotined inconsequence. To the upper classes of society these passages in life,these diplomatic meetings and discussions are like the necessarycesspools where the filth of life is thrown. Full of pity for hisclient, Mathias cast a foreseeing eye into the future and saw nothinggood.""We\'ll take the field with the same weapons,"" thought he, ""and beatthem.""At this moment, Paul, Solonet and Madame Evangelista, becomingembarrassed by the old man\'s silence, felt that the approval of thatcensor was necessary to carry out the transaction, and all three turnedto him simultaneously.""Well, my dear Monsieur Mathias, what do you think of it?"" said Paul.""This is what I think,"" said the conscientious and uncompromisingnotary. ""You are not rich enough to commit such regal folly. The estateof Lanstrac, if estimated at three per cent on its rentals, represents,with its furniture, one million; the farms of Grassol and Guadet andyour vineyard of Belle-Rose are worth another million; your two housesin Bordeaux and Paris, with their furniture, a third million. Againstthose three millions, yielding forty-seven thousand francs a year,Mademoiselle Natalie brings eight hundred thousand francs in theFive-per-cents, the diamonds (supposing them to be worth a hundredthousand francs, which is still problematical) and fifty thousand francsin money; in all, one million and fifty thousand francs. In presence ofsuch facts my brother notary tells you boastfully that we are marryingequal fortunes! He expects us to encumber ourselves with a debtof eleven hundred and fifty-six thousand francs to our children byacknowledging the receipt of our wife\'s patrimony, when we have actuallyreceived but little more than a doubtful million. You are listening tosuch stuff with the rapture of a lover, and you think that old Mathias,who is not in love, can forget arithmetic, and will not point out thedifference between landed estate, the actual value of which is enormousand constantly increasing, and the revenues of personal property, thecapital of which is subject to fluctuations and diminishment of income.I am old enough to have learned that money dwindles and land augments.You have called me in, Monsieur le comte, to stipulate for yourinterests; either let me defend those interests, or dismiss me.""""If monsieur is seeking a fortune equal in capital to his own,"" saidSolonet, ""we certainly cannot give it to him. We do not possess threemillions and a half; nothing can be more evident. While you can boastof your three overwhelming millions, we can only produce our poor onemillion,--a mere nothing in your eyes, though three times the dowry ofan archduchess of Austria. Bonaparte received only two hundred and fiftythousand francs with Maria-Louisa.""""Maria-Louisa was the ruin of Bonaparte,"" muttered Mathias.Natalie\'s mother caught the words.""If my sacrifices are worth nothing,"" she cried, ""I do not choose tocontinue such a discussion; I trust to the discretion of Monsieur lecomte, and I renounce the honor of his hand for my daughter.""According to the strategy marked out by the younger notary, this battleof contending interests had now reached the point where victory wascertain for Madame Evangelista. The mother-in-law had opened her heart,delivered up her property, and was therefore practically released as herdaughter\'s guardian. The future husband, under pain of ignoring the lawsof generous propriety and being false to love, ought now to accept theseconditions previously planned, and cleverly led up to by Solonet andMadame Evangelista. Like the hands of a clock turned by mechanism, Paulcame faithfully up to time.""Madame!"" he exclaimed, ""is it possible you can think of breaking offthe marriage?""""Monsieur,"" she replied, ""to whom am I accountable? To my daughter. Whenshe is twenty-one years of age she will receive my guardianship accountand release me. She will then possess a million, and can, if she likes,choose her husband among the sons of the peers of France. She is adaughter of the Casa-Reale.""""Madame is right,"" remarked Solonet. ""Why should she be more hardlypushed to-day than she will be fourteen months hence? You ought not todeprive her of the benefits of her maternity.""""Mathias,"" cried Paul, in deep distress, ""there are two sorts of ruin,and you are bringing one upon me at this moment.""He made a step towards the old notary, no doubt intending to tellhim that the contract must be drawn at once. But Mathias stopped thatdisaster with a glance which said, distinctly, ""Wait!"" He saw the tearsin Paul\'s eyes,--tears drawn from an honorable man by the shame of thisdiscussion as much as by the peremptory speech of Madame Evangelista,threatening rupture,--and the old man stanched them with a gesture likethat of Archimedes when he cried, ""Eureka!"" The words ""peer of France""had been to him like a torch in a dark crypt.Natalie appeared at this moment, dazzling as the dawn, saying, withinfantine look and manner, ""Am I in the way?""""Singularly so, my child,"" answered her mother, in a bitter tone.""Come in, dear Natalie,"" said Paul, taking her hand and leading her to achair near the fireplace. ""All is settled.""He felt it impossible to endure the overthrow of their mutual hopes.""Yes, all can be settled,"" said Mathias, hastily interposing.Like a general who, in a moment, upsets the plans skilfully laid andprepared by the enemy, the old notary, enlightened by that genius whichpresides over notaries, saw an idea, capable of saving the future ofPaul and his children, unfolding itself in legal form before his eyes.Maitre Solonet, who perceived no other way out of these irreconcilabledifficulties than the resolution with which Paul\'s love inspired him,and to which this conflict of feelings and thwarted interests hadbrought him, was extremely surprised at the sudden exclamation of hisbrother notary. Curious to know the remedy that Mathias had found ina state of things which had seemed to him beyond all other relief, hesaid, addressing the old man:--""What is it you propose?""""Natalie, my dear child, leave us,"" said Madame Evangelista.""Mademoiselle is not in the way,"" replied Mathias, smiling. ""I am goingto speak in her interests as well as in those of Monsieur le comte.""Silence reigned for a moment, during which time everybody present,oppressed with anxiety, awaited the allocution of the venerable notarywith unspeakable curiosity.""In these days,"" continued Maitre Mathias, after a pause, ""theprofession of notary has changed from what it was. Political revolutionsnow exert an influence over the prospects of families, which neverhappened in former times. In those days existences were clearly defined;so were rank and position--""""We are not here for a lecture on political ceremony, but to draw up amarriage contract,"" said Solonet, interrupting the old man, impatiently.""I beg you to allow me to speak in my turn as I see fit,"" replied theother.Solonet turned away and sat down on the ottoman, saying, in a low voice,to Madame Evangelista:--""You will now hear what we call in the profession \'balderdash.\'""""Notaries are therefore compelled to follow the course of politicalevents, which are now intimately connected with private interests. Hereis an example: formerly noble families owned fortunes that were nevershaken, but which the laws, promulgated by the Revolution, destroyed,and the present system tends to reconstruct,"" resumed the old notary,yielding to the loquacity of the ""tabellionaris boa-constrictor""(boa-notary). ""Monsieur le comte by his name, his talents, and hisfortune is called upon to sit some day in the elective Chamber. Perhapshis destiny will take him to the hereditary Chamber, for we know that hehas talent and means enough to fulfil that expectation. Do you not agreewith me, madame?"" he added, turning to the widow.""You anticipate my dearest hope,"" she replied. ""Monsieur de Manervillemust be a peer of France, or I shall die of mortification.""""Therefore all that leads to that end--"" continued Mathias with acordial gesture to the astute mother-in-law.""--will promote my eager desire,"" she replied.""Well, then,"" said Mathias, ""is not this marriage the proper occasion onwhich to entail the estate and create the family? Such a course would,undoubtedly, militate in the mind of the present government in favor ofthe nomination of my client whenever a batch of appointments is sent in.Monsieur le comte can very well afford to devote the estate ofLanstrac (which is worth a million) to this purpose. I do not ask thatmademoiselle should contribute an equal sum; that would not be just.But we can surely apply eight hundred thousand of her patrimony to thisobject. There are two domains adjoining Lanstrac now to be sold, whichcan be purchased for that sum, which will return in rentals four and ahalf per cent. The house in Paris should be included in the entail. Thesurplus of the two fortunes, if judiciously managed, will amply sufficefor the fortunes of the younger children. If the contracting partieswill agree to this arrangement, Monsieur ought certainly to accept yourguardianship account with its deficiency. I consent to that.""""Questa coda non e di questo gatto (That tail doesn\'t belong to thatcat),"" murmured Madame Evangelista, appealing to Solonet.""There\'s a snake in the grass somewhere,"" answered Solonet, in a lowvoice, replying to the Italian proverb with a French one.""Why do you make this fuss?"" asked Paul, leading Mathias into theadjoining salon.""To save you from being ruined,"" replied the old notary, in a whisper.""You are determined to marry a girl and her mother who have alreadysquandered two millions in seven years; you are pledging yourself toa debt of eleven hundred thousand francs to your children, to whomyou will have to account for the fortune you are acknowledging to havereceived with their mother. You risk having your own fortune squanderedin five years, and to be left as naked as Saint-John himself, besidesbeing a debtor to your wife and children for enormous sums. If you aredetermined to put your life in that boat, Monsieur le comte, of courseyou can do as you choose; but at least let me, your old friend, try tosave the house of Manerville.""""How is this scheme going to save it?"" asked Paul.""Monsieur le comte, you are in love--""""Yes.""""A lover is about as discreet as a cannon-ball; therefore, I shall notexplain. If you repeated what I should say, your marriage would probablybe broken off. I protect your love by my silence. Have you confidence inmy devotion?""""A fine question!""""Well, then, believe me when I tell you that Madame Evangelista, hernotary, and her daughter, are tricking us through thick and thin; theyare more than clever. Tudieu! what a sly game!""""Not Natalie,"" cried Paul.""I sha\'n\'t put my fingers between the bark and the tree,"" said theold man. ""You want her, take her! But I wish you were well out of thismarriage, if it could be done without the least wrong-doing on yourpart.""""Why do you wish it?""""Because that girl will spend the mines of Peru. Besides, see how sherides a horse,--like the groom of a circus; she is half emancipatedalready. Such girls make bad wives.""Paul pressed the old man\'s hand, saying, with a confident air ofself-conceit:--""Don\'t be uneasy as to that! But now, at this moment, what am I to do?""""Hold firm to my conditions. They will consent, for no one\'s apparentinterest is injured. Madame Evangelista is very anxious to marry herdaughter; I see that in her little game--Beware of her!""Paul returned to the salon, where he found his future mother-in-lawconversing in a low tone with Solonet. Natalie, kept outside of thesemysterious conferences, was playing with a screen. Embarrassed by herposition, she was thinking to herself: ""How odd it is that they tell menothing of my own affairs.""The younger notary had seized, in the main, the future effect of the newproposal, based, as it was, on the self-love of both parties, into whichhis client had fallen headlong. Now, while Mathias was more than a merenotary, Solonet was still a young man, and brought into his businessthe vanity of youth. It often happens that personal conceit makes a manforgetful of the interests of his client. In this case, Maitre Solonet,who would not suffer the widow to think that Nestor had vanquishedAchilles, advised her to conclude the marriage on the terms proposed.Little he cared for the future working of the marriage contract; to him,the conditions of victory were: Madame Evangelista released from herobligations as guardian, her future secured, and Natalie married.""Bordeaux shall know that you have ceded eleven hundred thousand francsto your daughter, and that you still have twenty-five thousand francsa year left,"" whispered Solonet to his client. ""For my part, I did notexpect to obtain such a fine result.""""But,"" she said, ""explain to me why the creation of this entail shouldhave calmed the storm at once.""""It relieves their distrust of you and your daughter. An entail isunchangeable; neither husband nor wife can touch that capital.""""Then this arrangement is positively insulting!""""No; we call it simply precaution. The old fellow has caught you in anet. If you refuse to consent to the entail, he can reply: \'Then yourobject is to squander the fortune of my client, who, by the creationof this entail, is protected from all such injury as securely as if themarriage took place under the ""regime dotal.""\'""Solonet quieted his own scruples by reflecting: ""After all, thesestipulations will take effect only in the future, by which time MadameEvangelista will be dead and buried.""Madame Evangelista contented herself, for the present, with theseexplanations, having full confidence in Solonet. She was wholly ignorantof law; considering her daughter as good as married, she thought she hadgained her end, and was filled with the joy of success. Thus, asMathias had shrewdly calculated, neither Solonet nor Madame Evangelistaunderstood as yet, to its full extent, this scheme which he had based onreasons that were undeniable.""Well, Monsieur Mathias,"" said the widow, ""all is for the best, is itnot?""""Madame, if you and Monsieur le comte consent to this arrangementyou ought to exchange pledges. It is fully understood, I suppose,"" hecontinued, looking from one to the other, ""that the marriage willonly take place on condition of creating an entail upon the estate ofLanstrac and the house in the rue de la Pepiniere, together with eighthundred thousand francs in money brought by the future wife, the saidsum to be invested in landed property? Pardon me the repetition, madame;but a positive and solemn engagement becomes absolutely necessary.The creation of an entail requires formalities, application to thechancellor, a royal ordinance, and we ought at once to conclude thepurchase of the new estate in order that the property be included inthe royal ordinance by virtue of which it becomes inalienable. In manyfamilies this would be reduced to writing, but on this occasion I thinka simple consent would suffice. Do you consent?""""Yes,"" replied Madame Evangelista.""Yes,"" said Paul.""And I?"" asked Natalie, laughing.""You are a minor, mademoiselle,"" replied Solonet; ""don\'t complain ofthat.""It was then agreed that Maitre Mathias should draw up the contract,Maitre Solonet the guardianship account and release, and that bothdocuments should be signed, as the law requires some days before thecelebration of the marriage. After a few polite salutations the notarieswithdrew.""It rains, Mathias; shall I take you home?"" said Solonet. ""My cabrioletis here.""""My carriage is here too,"" said Paul, manifesting an intention toaccompany the old man.""I won\'t rob you of a moment\'s pleasure,"" said Mathias. ""I accept myfriend Solonet\'s offer.""""Well,"" said Achilles to Nestor, as the cabriolet rolled away, ""you havebeen truly patriarchal to-night. The fact is, those young people wouldcertainly have ruined themselves.""""I felt anxious about their future,"" replied Mathias, keeping silent asto the real motives of his proposition.At this moment the two notaries were like a pair of actors arm inarm behind the stage on which they have played a scene of hatred andprovocation.""But,"" said Solonet, thinking of his rights as notary, ""isn\'t it myplace to buy that land you mentioned? The money is part of our dowry.""""How can you put property bought in the name of Mademoiselle Evangelistainto the creation of an entail by the Comte de Manerville?"" repliedMathias.""We shall have to ask the chancellor about that,"" said Solonet.""But I am the notary of the seller as well as of the buyer of thatland,"" said Mathias. ""Besides, Monsieur de Manerville can buy in his ownname. At the time of payment we can make mention of the fact that thedowry funds are put into it.""""You\'ve an answer for everything, old man,"" said Solonet, laughing. ""Youwere really surpassing to-night; you beat us squarely.""""For an old fellow who didn\'t expect your batteries of grape-shot, I didpretty well, didn\'t I?""""Ha! ha! ha!"" laughed Solonet.The odious struggle in which the material welfare of a family had beenso perilously near destruction was to the two notaries nothing more thana matter of professional polemics.""I haven\'t been forty years in harness for nothing,"" remarked Mathias.""Look here, Solonet,"" he added, ""I\'m a good fellow; you shall help indrawing the deeds for the sale of those lands.""""Thanks, my dear Mathias. I\'ll serve you in return on the very firstoccasion.""While the two notaries were peacefully returning homeward, with no othersensations than a little throaty warmth, Paul and Madame Evangelistawere left a prey to the nervous trepidation, the quivering of the fleshand brain which excitable natures pass through after a scene in whichtheir interests and their feelings have been violently shaken. In MadameEvangelista these last mutterings of the storm were overshadowed by aterrible reflection, a lurid gleam which she wanted, at any cost, todispel.""Has Maitre Mathias destroyed in a few minutes the work I have beendoing for six months?"" she asked herself. ""Was he withdrawing Paul frommy influence by filling his mind with suspicion during their secretconference in the next room?""She was standing absorbed in these thoughts before the fireplace, herelbow resting on the marble mantel-shelf. When the porte-cochere closedbehind the carriage of the two notaries, she turned to her futureson-in-law, impatient to solve her doubts.""This has been the most terrible day of my life,"" cried Paul, overjoyedto see all difficulties vanish. ""I know no one so downright in speechas that old Mathias. May God hear him, and make me peer of France! DearNatalie, I desire this for your sake more than for my own. You are myambition; I live only in you.""Hearing this speech uttered in the accents of the heart, and noting,more especially, the limpid azure of Paul\'s eyes, whose glance betrayedno thought of double meaning, Madame Evangelista\'s satisfaction wascomplete. She regretted the sharp language with which she had spurredhim, and in the joy of success she resolved to reassure him as to thefuture. Calming her countenance, and giving to her eyes that expressionof tender friendship which made her so attractive, she smiled andanswered:--""I can say as much to you. Perhaps, dear Paul, my Spanish nature hasled me farther than my heart desired. Be what you are,--kind as Godhimself,--and do not be angry with me for a few hasty words. Shakehands.""Paul was abashed; he fancied himself to blame, and he kissed MadameEvangelista.""Dear Paul,"" she said with much emotion, ""why could not those two sharkshave settled this matter without dragging us into it, since it was soeasy to settle?""""In that case I should not have known how grand and generous you canbe,"" replied Paul.""Indeed she is, Paul,"" cried Natalie, pressing his hand.""We have still a few little matters to settle, my dear son,"" said MadameEvangelista. ""My daughter and I are above the foolish vanities to whichso many persons cling. Natalie does not need my diamonds, but I am gladto give them to her.""""Ah! my dear mother, do you suppose that I will accept them?""""Yes, my child; they are one of the conditions of the contract.""""I will not allow it; I will not marry at all,"" cried Natalie,vehemently. ""Keep those jewels which my father took such pride incollecting for you. How could Monsieur Paul exact--""""Hush, my dear,"" said her mother, whose eyes now filled with tears. ""Myignorance of business compels me to a greater sacrifice than that.""""What sacrifice?""""I must sell my house in order to pay the money that I owe to you.""""What money can you possibly owe to me?"" she said; ""to me, who oweyou life! If my marriage costs you the slightest sacrifice, I will notmarry.""""Child!""""Dear Natalie, try to understand that neither I, nor your mother, noryou yourself, require these sacrifices, but our children.""""Suppose I do not marry at all?""""Do you not love me?"" said Paul, tenderly.""Come, come, my silly child; do you imagine that a contract is like ahouse of cards which you can blow down at will? Dear little ignoramus,you don\'t know what trouble we have had to found an entail for thebenefit of your eldest son. Don\'t cast us back into the discussions fromwhich we have just escaped.""""Why do you wish to ruin my mother?"" said Natalie, looking at Paul.""Why are you so rich?"" he replied, smiling.""Don\'t quarrel, my children, you are not yet married,"" said MadameEvangelista. ""Paul,"" she continued, ""you are not to give eithercorbeille, or jewels, or trousseau. Natalie has everything in profusion.Lay by the money you would otherwise put into wedding presents. I knownothing more stupidly bourgeois and commonplace than to spend a hundredthousand francs on a corbeille, when five thousand a year given to ayoung woman saves her much anxiety and lasts her lifetime. Besides, themoney for a corbeille is needed to decorate your house in Paris. Wewill return to Lanstrac in the spring; for Solonet is to settle my debtsduring the winter.""""All is for the best,"" cried Paul, at the summit of happiness.""So I shall see Paris!"" cried Natalie, in a tone that would justly havealarmed de Marsay.""If we decide upon this plan,"" said Paul, ""I\'ll write to de Marsay andget him to take a box for me at the Bouffons and also at the Italianopera.""""You are very kind; I should never have dared to ask for it,"" saidNatalie. ""Marriage is a very agreeable institution if it gives husbandsa talent for divining the wishes of their wives.""""It is nothing else,"" replied Paul. ""But see how late it is; I ought togo.""""Why leave so soon to-night?"" said Madame Evangelista, employing thosecoaxing ways to which men are so sensitive.Though all this passed on the best of terms, and according to the lawsof the most exquisite politeness, the effect of the discussion ofthese contending interests had, nevertheless, cast between son andmother-in-law a seed of distrust and enmity which was liable to sproutunder the first heat of anger, or the warmth of a feeling too harshlybruised. In most families the settlement of ""dots"" and the deeds ofgift required by a marriage contract give rise to primitive emotions ofhostility, caused by self-love, by the lesion of certain sentiments, byregret for the sacrifices made, and by the desire to diminish them. Whendifficulties arise there is always a victorious side and a vanquishedone. The parents of the future pair try to conclude the matter, which ispurely commercial in their eyes, to their own advantage; and thisleads to the trickery, shrewdness, and deception of such negotiations.Generally the husband alone is initiated into the secret of thesediscussions, and the wife is kept, like Natalie, in ignorance of thestipulations which make her rich or poor.As he left the house, Paul reflected that, thanks to the clevernessof his notary, his fortune was almost entirely secured from injury. IfMadame Evangelista did not live apart from her daughter their unitedhousehold would have an income of more than a hundred thousand francsto spend. All his expectations of a happy and comfortable life would berealized.""My mother-in-law seems to me an excellent woman,"" he thought, stillunder the influence of the cajoling manner by which she had endeavoredto disperse the clouds raised by the discussion. ""Mathias is mistaken.These notaries are strange fellows; they envenom everything. The harmstarted from that little cock-sparrow Solonet, who wanted to play aclever game.""While Paul went to bed recapitulating the advantages he had won duringthe evening, Madame Evangelista was congratulating herself equally onher victory.""Well, darling mother, are you satisfied?"" said Natalie, followingMadame Evangelista into her bedroom.""Yes, love,"" replied the mother, ""everything went well, according to mywishes; I feel a weight lifted from my shoulders which was crushing me.Paul is a most easy-going man. Dear fellow! yes, certainly, we must makehis life prosperous. You will make him happy, and I will be responsiblefor his political success. The Spanish ambassador used to be a friendof mine, and I\'ll renew the relation--as I will with the rest of myold acquaintance. Oh! you\'ll see! we shall soon be in the very heartof Parisian life; all will be enjoyment for us. You shall have thepleasures, my dearest, and I the last occupation of existence,--the gameof ambition! Don\'t be alarmed when you see me selling this house. Do yousuppose we shall ever come back to live in Bordeaux? no. Lanstrac? yes.But we shall spend all our winters in Paris, where our real interestslie. Well, Natalie, tell me, was it very difficult to do what I asked ofyou?""""My little mamma! every now and then I felt ashamed.""""Solonet advises me to put the proceeds of this house into an annuity,""said Madame Evangelista, ""but I shall do otherwise; I won\'t take a pennyof my fortune from you.""""I saw you were all very angry,"" said Natalie. ""How did the tempest calmdown?""""By an offer of my diamonds,"" replied Madame Evangelista. ""Solonet wasright. How ably he conducted the whole affair. Get out my jewel-case,Natalie. I have never seriously considered what my diamonds are worth.When I said a hundred thousand francs I talked nonsense. Madame de Gyasalways declared that the necklace and ear-rings your father gave me onour marriage day were worth at least that sum. My poor husband was solavish! Then my family diamond, the one Philip the Second gave to theDuke of Alba, and which my aunt bequeathed to me, the \'Discreto,\' was,I think, appraised in former times at four thousand quadruples,--one ofour Spanish gold coins.""Natalie laid out upon her mother\'s toilet-table the pearl necklace,the sets of jewels, the gold bracelets and precious stones of alldescription, with that inexpressible sensation enjoyed by certain womenat the sight of such treasures, by which--so commentators on the Talmudsay--the fallen angels seduce the daughters of men, having sought theseflowers of celestial fire in the bowels of the earth.""Certainly,"" said Madame Evangelista, ""though I know nothing aboutjewels except how to accept and wear them, I think there must be a greatdeal of money in these. Then, if we make but one household, I cansell my plate, the weight of which, as mere silver, would bringthirty thousand francs. I remember when we brought it from Lima, thecustom-house officers weighed and appraised it. Solonet is right, I\'llsend to-morrow to Elie Magus. The Jew shall estimate the value of thesethings. Perhaps I can avoid sinking any of my fortune in an annuity.""""What a beautiful pearl necklace!"" said Natalie.""He ought to give it to you, if he loves you,"" replied her mother; ""andI think he might have all my other jewels reset and let you keep them.The diamonds are a part of your property in the contract. And now,good-night, my darling. After the fatigues of this day we both needrest.""The woman of luxury, the Creole, the great lady, incapable of analyzingthe results of a contract which was not yet in force, went to sleep inthe joy of seeing her daughter married to a man who was easy to manage,who would let them both be mistresses of his home, and whose fortune,united to theirs, would require no change in their way of living.Thus having settled her account with her daughter, whose patrimony wasacknowledged in the contract, Madame Evangelista could feel at her ease.""How foolish of me to worry as I did,"" she thought. ""But I wish themarriage were well over.""So Madame Evangelista, Paul, Natalie, and the two notaries were equallysatisfied with the first day\'s result. The Te Deum was sung in bothcamps,--a dangerous situation; for there comes a moment when thevanquished side is aware of its mistake. To Madame Evangelista\'s mind,her son-in-law was the vanquished side.']"
81,5,Chapter 5,"['IV. THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT--SECOND DAYThe next day Elie Magus (who happened at that time to be in Bordeaux)obeyed Madame Evangelista\'s summons, believing, from general rumor as tothe marriage of Comte Paul with Mademoiselle Natalie, that it concerneda purchase of jewels for the bride. The Jew was, therefore, astonishedwhen he learned that, on the contrary, he was sent for to estimate thevalue of the mother-in-law\'s property. The instinct of his race, as wellas certain insidious questions, made him aware that the value of thediamonds was included in the marriage-contract. The stones were not tobe sold, and yet he was to estimate them as if some private personwere buying them from a dealer. Jewellers alone know how to distinguishbetween the diamonds of Asia and those of Brazil. The stones of Golcondaand Visapur are known by a whiteness and glittering brilliancy whichothers have not,--the water of the Brazilian diamonds having a yellowtinge which reduces their selling value. Madame Evangelista\'s necklaceand ear-rings, being composed entirely of Asiatic diamonds, were valuedby Elie Magus at two hundred and fifty thousand francs. As forthe ""Discreto,"" he pronounced it one of the finest diamonds in thepossession of private persons; it was known to the trade and valued atone hundred thousand francs. On hearing this estimate, which proved toher the lavishness of her husband, Madame Evangelista asked the old Jewwhether she should be able to obtain that money immediately.""Madame,"" replied the Jew, ""if you wish to sell I can give you onlyseventy-five thousand for the brilliant, and one hundred and sixtythousand for the necklace and earrings.""""Why such reduction?""""Madame,"" replied Magus, ""the finer the diamond, the longer we keep itunsold. The rarity of such investments is one reason for the high valueset upon precious stones. As the merchant cannot lose the interest ofhis money, this additional sum, joined to the rise and fall to whichsuch merchandise is subject, explains the difference between the priceof purchase and the price of sale. By owning these diamonds you havelost the interest on three hundred thousand francs for twenty years.If you wear your jewels ten times a year, it costs you three thousandfrancs each evening to put them on. How many beautiful gowns you couldbuy with that sum. Those who own diamonds are, therefore, veryfoolish; but, luckily for us, women are never willing to understand thecalculation.""""I thank you for explaining it to me, and I shall profit by it.""""Do you wish to sell?"" asked Magus, eagerly.""What are the other jewels worth?""The Jew examined the gold of the settings, held the pearls to the light,scrutinized the rubies, the diadems, clasps, bracelets, and chains, andsaid, in a mumbling tone:--""A good many Portuguese diamonds from Brazil are among them. They arenot worth more than a hundred thousand to me. But,"" he added, ""a dealerwould sell them to a customer for one hundred and fifty thousand, atleast.""""I shall keep them,"" said Madame Evangelista.""You are wrong,"" replied Elie Magus. ""With the income from the sum theyrepresent you could buy just as fine diamonds in five years, and havethe capital to boot.""This singular conference became known, and corroborated certain rumorsexcited by the discussion of the contract. The servants of the house,overhearing high voices, supposed the difficulties greater than theyreally were. Their gossip with other valets spread the information,which from the lower regions rose to the ears of the masters. Theattention of society, and of the town in general, became so fixed onthe marriage of two persons equally rich and well-born, that every one,great and small, busied themselves about the matter, and in less than aweek the strangest rumors were bruited about.""Madame Evangelista sells her house; she must be ruined. She offered herdiamonds to Elie Magus. Nothing is really settled between herself andthe Comte de Manerville. Is it probable that the marriage will ever takeplace?""To this question some answered yes, and others said no. The twonotaries, when questioned, denied these calumnies, and declared thatthe difficulties arose only from the official delay in constituting theentail. But when public opinion has taken a trend in one direction itis very difficult to turn it back. Though Paul went every day to MadameEvangelista\'s house, and though the notaries denied these assertionscontinually, the whispered calumny went on. Young girls, and theirmothers and aunts, vexed at a marriage they had dreamed of forthemselves or for their families, could not forgive the Spanish ladiesfor their happiness, as authors cannot forgive each other for theirsuccess. A few persons revenged themselves for the twenty-years luxuryand grandeur of the family of Evangelista, which had lain heavily ontheir self-love. A leading personage at the prefecture declared thatthe notaries could have chosen no other language and followed no otherconduct in the case of a rupture. The time actually required for theestablishment of the entail confirmed the suspicions of the Bordeauxprovincials.""They will keep the ball going through the winter; then, in the spring,they will go to some watering-place, and we shall learn before the yearis out that the marriage is off.""""And, of course, we shall be given to understand,"" said others, ""forthe sake of the honor of the two families, that the difficulties did notcome from either side, but the chancellor refused to consent; you maybe sure it will be some quibble about that entail which will cause therupture.""""Madame Evangelista,"" some said, ""lived in a style that the mines ofValencia couldn\'t meet. When the time came to melt the bell, and pay thedaughter\'s patrimony, nothing would be found to pay it with.""The occasion was excellent to add up the spendings of the handsome widowand prove, categorically, her ruin. Rumors were so rife that bets weremade for and against the marriage. By the laws of worldly jurisprudencethis gossip was not allowed to reach the ears of the parties concerned.No one was enemy or friend enough to Paul or to Madame Evangelistato inform either of what was being said. Paul had some business atLanstrac, and used the occasion to make a hunting-party for severalof the young men of Bordeaux,--a sort of farewell, as it were, to hisbachelor life. This hunting party was accepted by society as a signalconfirmation of public suspicion.When this event occurred, Madame de Gyas, who had a daughter to marry,thought it high time to sound the matter, and to condole, with joyfulheart, the blow received by the Evangelistas. Natalie and her motherwere somewhat surprised to see the lengthened face of the marquise, andthey asked at once if anything distressing had happened to her.""Can it be,"" she replied, ""that you are ignorant of the rumors that arecirculating? Though I think them false myself, I have come to learn thetruth in order to stop this gossip, at any rate among the circle of myown friends. To be the dupes or the accomplices of such an error is toofalse a position for true friends to occupy.""""But what is it? what has happened?"" asked mother and daughter.Madame de Gyas thereupon allowed herself the happiness of repeating allthe current gossip, not sparing her two friends a single stab. Natalieand Madame Evangelista looked at each other and laughed, but they fullyunderstood the meaning of the tale and the motives of their friend.The Spanish lady took her revenge very much as Celimene took hers onArsinoe.""My dear, are you ignorant--you who know the provinces so well--canyou be ignorant of what a mother is capable when she has on her handsa daughter whom she cannot marry for want of \'dot\' and lovers, want ofbeauty, want of mind, and, sometimes, want of everything? Why, a motherin that position would rob a diligence or commit a murder, or wait for aman at the corner of a street--she would sacrifice herself twenty timesover, if she was a mother at all. Now, as you and I both know, there aremany such in that situation in Bordeaux, and no doubt they attribute tous their own thoughts and actions. Naturalists have depicted the habitsand customs of many ferocious animals, but they have forgotten themother and daughter in quest of a husband. Such women are hyenas, goingabout, as the Psalmist says, seeking whom they may devour, and adding tothe instinct of the brute the intellect of man, and the genius of woman.I can understand that those little spiders, Mademoiselle de Belor,Mademoiselle de Trans, and others, after working so long at their webswithout catching a fly, without so much as hearing a buzz, should befurious; I can even forgive their spiteful speeches. But that you, whocan marry your daughter when you please, you, who are rich and titled,you who have nothing of the provincial about you, whose daughter isclever and possesses fine qualities, with beauty and the power tochoose--that you, so distinguished from the rest by your Parisian grace,should have paid the least heed to this talk does really surprise me. AmI bound to account to the public for the marriage stipulations whichour notaries think necessary under the political circumstances of myson-in-law\'s future life? Has the mania for public discussion made itsway into families? Ought I to convoke in writing the fathers and mothersof the province to come here and give their vote on the clauses of ourmarriage contract?""A torrent of epigram flowed over Bordeaux. Madame Evangelista wasabout to leave the city, and could safely scan her friends and enemies,caricature them and lash them as she pleased, with nothing to fear inreturn. Accordingly, she now gave vent to her secret observations andher latent dislikes as she sought for the reason why this or that persondenied the shining of the sun at mid-day.""But, my dear,"" said the Marquise de Gyas, ""this stay of the count atLanstrac, these parties given to young men under such circumstances--""""Ah! my dear,"" said the great lady, interrupting the marquise, ""do yousuppose that we adopt the pettiness of bourgeois customs? Is Count Paulheld in bonds like a man who might seek to get away? Think you we oughtto watch him with a squad of gendarmes lest some provincial conspiracyshould get him away from us?""""Be assured, my dearest friend, that it gives me the greatest pleasureto--""Here her words were interrupted by a footman who entered the room toannounce Paul. Like many lovers, Paul thought it charming to ride twelvemiles to spend an hour with Natalie. He had left his friends whilehunting, and came in booted and spurred, and whip in hand.""Dear Paul,"" said Natalie, ""you don\'t know what an answer you are givingto madame.""When Paul heard of the gossip that was current in Bordeaux, he laughedinstead of being angry.""These worthy people have found out, perhaps, that there will be nowedding festivities, according to provincial usages, no marriage atmid-day in the church, and they are furious. Well, my dear mother,"" headded, kissing her hand, ""let us pacify them with a ball on the day whenwe sign the contract, just as the government flings a fete to the peoplein the great square of the Champs-Elysees, and we will give our dearfriends the dolorous pleasure of signing a marriage-contract such asthey have seldom heard of in the provinces.""This little incident proved of great importance. Madame Evangelistainvited all Bordeaux to witness the signature of the contract, andshowed her intention of displaying in this last fete a luxury whichshould refute the foolish lies of the community.The preparations for this event required over a month, and it was calledthe fete of the camellias. Immense quantities of that beautiful flowerwere massed on the staircase, and in the antechamber and supper-room.During this month the formalities for constituting the entail wereconcluded in Paris; the estates adjoining Lanstrac were purchased, thebanns were published, and all doubts finally dissipated. Friends andenemies thought only of preparing their toilets for the coming fete.The time occupied by these events obscured the difficulties raised bythe first discussion, and swept into oblivion the words and arguments ofthat stormy conference. Neither Paul nor his mother-in-law continued tothink of them. Were they not, after all, as Madame Evangelista had said,the affair of the two notaries?But--to whom has it never happened, when life is in its fullest flow, tobe suddenly changed by the voice of memory, raised, perhaps, too late,reminding us of some important new fact, some threatened danger? Onthe morning of the day when the contract was to be signed and the fetegiven, one of these flashes of the soul illuminated the mind of MadameEvangelista during the semi-somnolence of her waking hour. The wordsthat she herself had uttered at the moment when Mathias acceded toSolonet\'s conditions, ""Questa coda non e di questo gatto,"" were criedaloud in her mind by that voice of memory. In spite of her incapacityfor business, Madame Evangelista\'s shrewdness told her:--""If so clever a notary as Mathias was pacified, it must have been thathe saw compensation at the cost of _some one_.""That some one could not be Paul, as she had blindly hoped. Could it bethat her daughter\'s fortune was to pay the costs of war? She resolved todemand explanations on the tenor of the contract, not reflecting on thecourse she would have to take in case she found her interestsseriously compromised. This day had so powerful an influence on Paul deManerville\'s conjugal life that it is necessary to explain certain ofthe external circumstances which accompanied it.Madame Evangelista had shrunk from no expense for this dazzling fete.The court-yard was gravelled and converted into a tent, and filled withshrubs, although it was winter. The camellias, of which so much hadbeen said from Angouleme to Dax, were banked on the staircase and in thevestibules. Wall partitions had disappeared to enlarge the supper-roomand the ball-room where the dancing was to be. Bordeaux, a city famousfor the luxury of colonial fortunes, was on a tiptoe of expectation forthis scene of fairyland. About eight o\'clock, as the last discussionof the contract was taking place within the house, the inquisitivepopulace, anxious to see the ladies in full dress getting out of theircarriages, formed in two hedges on either side of the porte-cochere.Thus the sumptuous atmosphere of a fete acted upon all minds at themoment when the contract was being signed, illuminating colored lampslighted up the shrubs, and the wheels of the arriving guests echoedfrom the court-yard. The two notaries had dined with the bridal pair andtheir mother. Mathias\'s head-clerk, whose business it was to receive thesignatures of the guests during the evening (taking due care that thecontract was not surreptitiously read by the signers), was also presentat the dinner.No bridal toilet was ever comparable with that of Natalie, whose beauty,decked with laces and satin, her hair coquettishly falling in a myriadof curls about her throat, resembled that of a flower encased in itsfoliage. Madame Evangelista, robed in a gown of cherry velvet, a colorjudiciously chosen to heighten the brilliancy of her skin and her blackhair and eyes, glowed with the beauty of a woman at forty, and wore herpearl necklace, clasped with the ""Discreto,"" a visible contradiction tothe late calumnies.To fully explain this scene, it is necessary to say that Paul andNatalie sat together on a sofa beside the fireplace and paid noattention to the reading of the documents. Equally childish and equallyhappy, regarding life as a cloudless sky, rich, young, and loving, theychattered to each other in a low voice, sinking into whispers. Arminghis love with the presence of legality, Paul took delight in kissing thetips of Natalie\'s fingers, in lightly touching her snowy shoulders andthe waving curls of her hair, hiding from the eyes of others thesejoys of illegal emancipation. Natalie played with a screen of peacock\'sfeathers given to her by Paul,--a gift which is to love, according tosuperstitious belief in certain countries, as dangerous an omen as thegift of scissors or other cutting instruments, which recall, no doubt,the Parces of antiquity.Seated beside the two notaries, Madame Evangelista gave her closestattention to the reading of the documents. After listening to theguardianship account, most ably written out by Solonet, in whichNatalie\'s share of the three million and more francs left by MonsieurEvangelista was shown to be the much-debated eleven hundred andfifty-six thousand, Madame Evangelista said to the heedless youngcouple:--""Come, listen, listen, my children; this is your marriage contract.""The clerk drank a glass of iced-water, Solonet and Mathias blew theirnoses, Paul and Natalie looked at the four personages before them,listened to the preamble, and returned to their chatter. The statementof the property brought by each party; the general deed of gift inthe event of death without issue; the deed of gift of one-fourth inlife-interest and one-fourth in capital without interest, allowed bythe Code, whatever be the number of the children; the constitution of acommon fund for husband and wife; the settlement of the diamonds on thewife, the library and horses on the husband, were duly read and passedwithout observations. Then followed the constitution of the entail.When all was read and nothing remained but to sign the contract, MadameEvangelista demanded to know what would be the ultimate effect of theentail.""An entail, madam,"" replied Solonet, ""means an inalienable right tothe inheritance of certain property belonging to both husband and wife,which is settled from generation to generation on the eldest son ofthe house, without, however, depriving him of his right to share in thedivision of the rest of the property.""""What will be the effect of this on my daughter\'s rights?""Maitre Mathias, incapable of disguising the truth, replied:--""Madame, an entail being an appanage, or portion of property set asidefor this purpose from the fortunes of husband and wife, it follows thatif the wife dies first, leaving several children, one of them a son,Monsieur de Manerville will owe those children three hundred andsixty thousand francs only, from which he will deduct his fourth inlife-interest and his fourth in capital. Thus his debt to thosechildren will be reduced to one hundred and sixty thousand francs, orthereabouts, exclusive of his savings and profits from the common fundconstituted for husband and wife. If, on the contrary, he dies first,leaving a male heir, Madame de Manerville has a right to three hundredand sixty thousand francs only, and to her deeds of gift of such of herhusband\'s property as is not included in the entail, to the diamonds nowsettled upon her, and to her profits and savings from the common fund.""The effect of Maitre Mathias\'s astute and far-sighted policy were nowplainly seen.""My daughter is ruined,"" said Madame Evangelista in a low voice.The old and the young notary both overheard the words.""Is it ruin,"" replied Mathias, speaking gently, ""to constitute for herfamily an indestructible fortune?""The younger notary, seeing the expression of his client\'s face, thoughtit judicious in him to state the disaster in plain terms.""We tried to trick them out of three hundred thousand francs,"" hewhispered to the angry woman. ""They have actually laid hold of eighthundred thousand; it is a loss of four hundred thousand from ourinterests for the benefit of the children. You must now either break themarriage off at once, or carry it through,"" concluded Solonet.It is impossible to describe the moment of silence that followed. MaitreMathias waited in triumph the signature of the two persons who hadexpected to rob his client. Natalie, not competent to understand thatshe had lost half her fortune, and Paul, ignorant that the house ofManerville had gained it, were laughing and chattering still. Solonetand Madame Evangelista gazed at each other; the one endeavoring toconceal his indifference, the other repressing the rush of a crowd ofbitter feelings.After suffering in her own mind the struggles of remorse, after blamingPaul as the cause of her dishonesty, Madame Evangelista had decided toemploy those shameful manoeuvres to cast on him the burden of her ownunfaithful guardianship, considering him her victim. But now, in amoment, she perceived that where she thought she triumphed she was aboutto perish, and her victim was her own daughter. Guilty without profit,she saw herself the dupe of an honorable old man, whose respect she haddoubtless lost. Her secret conduct must have inspired the stipulationof old Mathias; and Mathias must have enlightened Paul. Horriblereflection! Even if he had not yet done so, as soon as that contract wassigned the old wolf would surely warn his client of the dangers hehad run and had now escaped, were it only to receive the praise of hissagacity. He would put him on his guard against the wily woman who hadlowered herself to this conspiracy; he would destroy the empire shehad conquered over her son-in-law! Feeble natures, once warned, turnobstinate, and are never won again. At the first discussion of thecontract she had reckoned on Paul\'s weakness, and on the impossibilityhe would feel of breaking off a marriage so far advanced. But now, sheherself was far more tightly bound. Three months earlier Paul had noreal obstacles to prevent the rupture; now, all Bordeaux knew that thenotaries had smoothed the difficulties; the banns were published; thewedding was to take place immediately; the friends of both families wereat that moment arriving for the fete, and to witness the contract. Howcould she postpone the marriage at this late hour? The cause of therupture would surely be made known; Maitre Mathias\'s stern honor wastoo well known in Bordeaux; his word would be believed in preference tohers. The scoffers would turn against her and against her daughter. No,she could not break it off; she must yield!These reflections, so cruelly sound, fell upon Madame Evangelista\'sbrain like a water-spout and split it. Though she still maintainedthe dignity and reserve of a diplomatist, her chin was shaken by thatapoplectic movement which showed the anger of Catherine the Second onthe famous day when, seated on her throne and in presence of her court(very much in the present circumstances of Madame Evangelista), she wasbraved by the King of Sweden. Solonet observed that play of the muscles,which revealed the birth of a mortal hatred, a lurid storm to whichthere was no lightning. At this moment Madame Evangelista vowed to herson-in-law one of those unquenchable hatreds the seeds of which wereleft by the Moors in the atmosphere of Spain.""Monsieur,"" she said, bending to the ear of her notary, ""you called thatstipulation balderdash; it seems to me that nothing could have been moreclear.""""Madame, allow me--""""Monsieur,"" she continued, paying no heed to his interruption, ""if youdid not perceive the effect of that entail at the time of our firstconference, it is very extraordinary that it did not occur to you in thesilence of your study. This can hardly be incapacity.""The young notary drew his client into the next room, saying to himself,as he did so:--""I get a three-thousand franc fee for the guardianship account, threethousand for the contract, six thousand on the sale of the house,fifteen thousand in all--better not be angry.""He closed the door, cast on Madame Evangelista the cool look of abusiness man, and said:--""Madame, having, for your sake, passed--as I did--the proper limitsof legal craft, do you seriously intend to reward my devotion by suchlanguage?""""But, monsieur--""""Madame, I did not, it is true, calculate the effect of the deeds ofgift. But if you do not wish Comte Paul for your son-in-law you are notobliged to accept him. The contract is not signed. Give your fete, andpostpone the signing. It is far better to brave Bordeaux than sacrificeyourself.""""How can I justify such a course to society, which is already prejudicedagainst us by the slow conclusion of the marriage?""""By some error committed in Paris; some missing document not sent withthe rest,"" replied Solonet.""But those purchases of land near Lanstrac?""""Monsieur de Manerville will be at no loss to find another bride andanother dowry.""""Yes, he\'ll lose nothing; but we lose all, all!""""You?"" replied Solonet; ""why, you can easily find another count who willcost you less money, if a title is the chief object of this marriage.""""No, no! we can\'t stake our honor in that way. I am caught in a trap,monsieur. All Bordeaux will ring with this to-morrow. Our solemn wordsare pledged--""""You wish the happiness of Mademoiselle Natalie.""""Above all things.""""To be happy in France,"" said the notary, ""means being mistress of thehome. She can lead that fool of a Manerville by the nose if she chooses;he is so dull he has actually seen nothing of all this. Even if he nowdistrusts you, he will always trust his wife; and his wife is YOU, isshe not? The count\'s fate is still within your power if you choose toplay the cards in your hand.""""If that were true, monsieur, I know not what I would not do to show mygratitude,"" she said, in a transport of feeling that colored her cheeks.""Let us now return to the others, madame,"" said Solonet. ""Listencarefully to what I shall say; and then--you shall think me incapable ifyou choose.""""My dear friend,"" said the young notary to Maitre Mathias, ""in spite ofyour great ability, you have not foreseen either the case of Monsieurde Manerville dying without children, nor that in which he leaves onlyfemale issue. In either of those cases the entail would pass to theManervilles, or, at any rate, give rise to suits on their part. I think,therefore, it is necessary to stipulate that in the first case theentailed property shall pass under the general deed of gift betweenhusband and wife; and in the second case that the entail shall bedeclared void. This agreement concerns the wife\'s interest.""""Both clauses seem to me perfectly just,"" said Maitre Mathias. ""Asto their ratification, Monsieur le comte can, doubtless, come to anunderstanding with the chancellor, if necessary.""Solonet took a pen and added this momentous clause on the margin of thecontract. Paul and Natalie paid no attention to the matter; but MadameEvangelista dropped her eyes while Maitre Mathias read the addedsentence aloud.""We will now sign,"" said the mother.The volume of voice which Madame Evangelista repressed as she utteredthose words betrayed her violent emotion. She was thinking to herself:""No, my daughter shall not be ruined--but he! My daughter shall have thename, the title, and the fortune. If she should some day discover thatshe does not love him, that she loves another, irresistibly, Paul shallbe driven out of France! My daughter shall be free, and happy, andrich.""If Maitre Mathias understood how to analyze business interests, heknew little of the analysis of human passions. He accepted MadameEvangelista\'s words as an honorable ""amende,"" instead of judging themfor what they were, a declaration of war. While Solonet and his clerksuperintended Natalie as she signed the documents,--an operation whichtook time,--Mathias took Paul aside and told him the meaning of thestipulation by which he had saved him from ultimate pain.""The whole affair is now \'en regle.\' I hold the documents. But thecontract contains a rescript for the diamonds; you must ask for them.Business is business. Diamonds are going up just now, but may go down.The purchase of those new domains justifies you in turning everythinginto money that you can. Therefore, Monsieur le comte, have no falsemodesty in this matter. The first payment is due after the formalitiesare over. The sum is two hundred thousand francs; put the diamonds intothat. You have the lien on this house, which will be sold at once, andwill pay the rest. If you have the courage to spend only fifty thousandfrancs for the next three years, you can save the two hundred thousandfrancs you are now obliged to pay. If you plant vineyards on your newestates, you can get an income of over twenty-five thousand francs uponthem. You may be said, in short, to have made a good marriage.""Paul pressed the hand of his old friend very affectionately, a gesturewhich did not escape Madame Evangelista, who now came forward to offerhim the pen. Suspicion became certainty to her mind. She was confidentthat Paul and Mathias had come to an understanding about her. Rage andhatred sent the blood surging through her veins to her heart. The worsthad come.After verifying that all the documents were duly signed and the initialsof the parties affixed to the bottom of the leaves, Maitre Mathiaslooked from Paul to his mother-in-law, and seeing that his client didnot intend to speak of the diamonds, he said:--""I do not suppose there can be any doubt about the transfer of thediamonds, as you are now one family.""""It would be more regular if Madame Evangelista made them over now,as Monsieur de Manerville has become responsible for the guardianshipfunds, and we never know who may live or die,"" said Solonet, who thoughthe saw in this circumstance fresh cause of anger in the mother-in-lawagainst the son-in-law.""Ah! mother,"" cried Paul, ""it would be insulting to us all to dothat,--\'Summum jus, summum injuria,\' monsieur,"" he said to Solonet.""And I,"" said Madame Evangelista, led by the hatred now surging in herheart to see a direct insult to her in the indirect appeal of MaitreMathias, ""I will tear that contract up if you do not take them.""She left the room in one of those furious passions which long for thepower to destroy everything, and which the sense of impotence drivesalmost to madness.""For Heaven\'s sake, take them, Paul,"" whispered Natalie in his ear. ""Mymother is angry; I shall know why to-night, and I will tell you. We mustpacify her.""Calmed by this first outburst, madame kept the necklace and ear-rings,which she was wearing, and brought the other jewels, valued at onehundred and fifty thousand francs by Elie Magus. Accustomed to the sightof family diamonds in all valuations of inheritance, Maitre Mathias andSolonet examined these jewels in their cases and exclaimed upon theirduty.""You will lose nothing, after all, upon the \'dot,\' Monsieur le comte,""said Solonet, bringing the color to Paul\'s face.""Yes,"" said Mathias, ""these jewels will meet the first payment on thepurchase of the new estate.""""And the costs of the contract,"" added Solonet.Hatred feeds, like love, on little things; the least thing strengthensit; as one beloved can do no evil, so the person hated can do no good.Madame Evangelista assigned to hypocrisy the natural embarrassment ofPaul, who was unwilling to take the jewels, and not knowing where toput the cases, longed to fling them from the window. Madame Evangelistaspurred him with a glance which seemed to say, ""Take your property fromhere.""""Dear Natalie,"" said Paul, ""put away these jewels; they are yours; Igive them to you.""Natalie locked them into the drawer of a console. At this instant thenoise of the carriages in the court-yard and the murmur of voices in thereceptions-rooms became so loud that Natalie and her mother were forcedto appear. The salons were filled in a few moments, and the fete began.""Profit by the honeymoon to sell those diamonds,"" said the old notary toPaul as he went away.While waiting for the dancing to begin, whispers went round about themarriage, and doubts were expressed as to the future of the promisedcouple.""Is it finally arranged?"" said one of the leading personages of the townto Madame Evangelista.""We had so many documents to read and sign that I fear we are ratherlate,"" she replied; ""but perhaps we are excusable.""""As for me, I heard nothing,"" said Natalie, giving her hand to her loverto open the ball.""Both of those young persons are extravagant, and the mother is not of akind to check them,"" said a dowager.""But they have founded an entail, I am told, worth fifty thousand francsa year.""""Pooh!""""In that I see the hand of our worthy Monsieur Mathias,"" said amagistrate. ""If it is really true, he has done it to save the future ofthe family.""""Natalie is too handsome not to be horribly coquettish. After a coupleof years of marriage,"" said one young woman, ""I wouldn\'t answer forMonsieur de Manerville\'s happiness in his home.""""The Pink of Fashion will then need staking,"" said Solonet, laughing.""Don\'t you think Madame Evangelista looks annoyed?"" asked another.""But, my dear, I have just been told that all she is able to keep istwenty-five thousand francs a year, and what is that to her?""""Penury!""""Yes, she has robbed herself for Natalie. Monsieur de Manerville hasbeen so exacting--""""Extremely exacting,"" put in Maitre Solonet. ""But before long he will bepeer of France. The Maulincours and the Vidame de Pamiers will use theirinfluence. He belongs to the faubourg Saint-Germain.""""Oh! he is received there, and that is all,"" said a lady, who hadtried to obtain him as a son-in-law. ""Mademoiselle Evangelista, asthe daughter of a merchant, will certainly not open the doors of thechapter-house of Cologne to him!""""She is grand-niece to the Duke of Casa-Reale.""""Through the female line!""The topic was presently exhausted. The card-players went to the tables,the young people danced, the supper was served, and the ball was notover till morning, when the first gleams of the coming day whitened thewindows.Having said adieu to Paul, who was the last to go away, MadameEvangelista went to her daughter\'s room; for her own had been taken bythe architect to enlarge the scene of the fete. Though Natalie and hermother were overcome with sleep, they said a few words to each other assoon as they were alone.""Tell me, mother dear, what was the matter with you?""""My darling, I learned this evening to what lengths a mother\'stenderness can go. You know nothing of business, and you are ignorant ofthe suspicions to which my integrity has been exposed. I have trampledmy pride under foot, for your happiness and my reputation were atstake.""""Are you talking of the diamonds? Poor boy, he wept; he did not wantthem; I have them.""""Sleep now, my child. We will talk business when we wake--for,"" sheadded, sighing, ""you and I have business now; another person has comebetween us.""""Ah! my dear mother, Paul will never be an obstacle to our happiness,yours and mine,"" murmured Natalie, as she went to sleep.""Poor darling! she little knows that the man has ruined her.""Madame Evangelista\'s soul was seized at that moment with the first ideaof avarice, a vice to which many become a prey as they grow aged. Itcame into her mind to recover in her daughter\'s interest the wholeof the property left by her husband. She told herself that her honordemanded it. Her devotion to Natalie made her, in a moment, as shrewdand calculating as she had hitherto been careless and wasteful. Sheresolved to turn her capital to account, after investing a part of itin the Funds, which were then selling at eighty francs. A passion oftenchanges the whole character in a moment; an indiscreet person becomes adiplomatist, a coward is suddenly brave. Hate made this prodigal womana miser. Chance and luck might serve the project of vengeance, stillundefined and confused, which she would now mature in her mind. She fellasleep, muttering to herself, ""To-morrow!"" By an unexplained phenomenon,the effects of which are familiar to all thinkers, her mind, duringsleep, marshalled its ideas, enlightened them, classed them, prepared ameans by which she was to rule Paul\'s life, and showed her a plan whichshe began to carry out on that very to-morrow.']"

THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT--THIRD DAYThough the excitement of the fete had driven from Paul\'s mind theanxious thoughts that now and then assailed it, when he was alone withhimself and in his bed they returned to torment him.""It seems to me,"" he said to himself, ""that without that good Mathias mymother-in-law would have tricked me. And yet, is that believable? Whatinterest could lead her to deceive me? Are we not to join fortunes andlive together? Well, well, why should I worry about it? In two daysNatalie will be my wife, our money relations are plainly defined,nothing can come between us. Vogue la galere--Nevertheless, I\'ll be uponmy guard. Suppose Mathias was right? Well, if he was, I\'m not obliged tomarry my mother-in-law.""In this second battle of the contract Paul\'s future had completelychanged in aspect, though he was not aware of it. Of the two personswhom he was marrying, one, the cleverest, was now his mortal enemy,and meditated already withdrawing her interests from the common fund.Incapable of observing the difference that a Creole nature placedbetween his mother-in-law and other women, Paul was far from suspectingher craftiness. The Creole nature is apart from all others; it derivesfrom Europe by its intellect, from the tropics by the illogical violenceof its passions, from the East by the apathetic indifference with whichit does, or suffers, either good or evil, equally,--a graceful naturewithal, but dangerous, as a child is dangerous if not watched. Like achild, the Creole woman must have her way immediately; like a child, shewould burn a house to boil an egg. In her soft and easy life she takesno care upon her mind; but when impassioned, she thinks of all things.She has something of the perfidy of the Negroes by whom she has beensurrounded from her cradle, but she is also as naive and even, at times,as artless as they. Like them and like the children, she wishes doggedlyfor one thing with a growing intensity of desire, and will brood uponthat idea until she hatches it. A strange assemblage of virtuesand defects! which her Spanish nature had strengthened in MadameEvangelista, and over which her French experience had cast the glaze ofits politeness.This character, slumbering in married happiness for sixteen years,occupied since then with the trivialities of social life, this natureto which a first hatred had revealed its strength, awoke now like aconflagration; at the moment of the woman\'s life when she was losingthe dearest object of her affections and needed another element for theenergy that possessed her, this flame burst forth. Natalie could be butthree days more beneath her influence! Madame Evangelista, vanquishedat other points, had one clear day before her, the last of those thata daughter spends beside her mother. A few words, and the Creole naturecould influence the lives of the two beings about to walk togetherthrough the brambled paths and the dusty high-roads of Parisian society,for Natalie believed in her mother blindly. What far-reaching powerwould the counsel of that Creole nature have on a mind so subservient!The whole future of these lives might be determined by one singlespeech. No code, no human institution can prevent the crime thatkills by words. There lies the weakness of social law; in that is thedifference between the morals of the great world and the morals of thepeople: one is frank, the other hypocritical; one employs the knife,the other the venom of ideas and language; to one death, to the otherimpunity.The next morning, about mid-day, Madame Evangelista was half seated,half lying on the edge of her daughter\'s bed. During that waking hourthey caressed and played together in happy memory of their loving life;a life in which no discord had ever troubled either the harmony oftheir feelings, the agreement of their ideas, or the mutual choice andenjoyment of their pleasures.""Poor little darling!"" said the mother, shedding true tears, ""how can Ihelp being sorrowful when I think that after I have fulfilled your everywish during your whole life you will belong, to-morrow night, to a manyou must obey?""""Oh, my dear mother, as for obeying!--"" and Natalie made a little motionof her head which expressed a graceful rebellion. ""You are joking,"" shecontinued. ""My father always gratified your caprices; and why not? heloved you. And I am loved, too.""""Yes, Paul has a certain love for you. But if a married woman isnot careful nothing more rapidly evaporates than conjugal love. Theinfluence a wife ought to have over her husband depends entirely on howshe begins with him. You need the best advice.""""But you will be with us.""""Possibly, my child. Last night, while the ball was going on, Ireflected on the dangers of our being together. If my presence were todo you harm, if the little acts by which you ought slowly, but surely,to establish your authority as a wife should be attributed to myinfluence, your home would become a hell. At the first frown I saw uponyour husband\'s brow I, proud as I am, should instantly leave his house.If I were driven to leave it, better, I think, not to enter it. I shouldnever forgive your husband if he caused trouble between us. Whereas,when you have once become the mistress, when your husband is to you whatyour father was to me, that danger is no longer to be feared. Thoughthis wise policy will cost your young and tender heart a pang, yourhappiness demands that you become the absolute sovereign of your home.""""Then why, mamma, did you say just now I must obey him?""""My dear little daughter, in order that a wife may rule, she must alwaysseem to do what her husband wishes. If you were not told this you mightby some impulsive opposition destroy your future. Paul is a weak youngman; he might allow a friend to rule him; he might even fall under thedominion of some woman who would make you feel her influence. Preventsuch disasters by making yourself from the very start his ruler. Is itnot better that he be governed by you than by others?""""Yes, certainly,"" said Natalie. ""I should think only of his happiness.""""And it is my privilege, darling, to think only of yours, and to wishnot to leave you at so crucial a moment without a compass in the midstof the reefs through which you must steer.""""But, dearest mother, are we not strong enough, you and I, to staytogether beside him, without having to fear those frowns you seem todread. Paul loves you, mamma.""""Oh! oh! He fears me more than he loves me. Observe him carefully to-daywhen I tell him that I shall let you go to Paris without me, and youwill see on his face, no matter what pains he takes to conceal it, hisinward joy.""""Why should he feel so?""""Why? Dear child! I am like Saint-Jean Bouche-d\'Or. I will tell that tohimself, and before you.""""But suppose I marry on condition that you do not leave me?"" urgedNatalie.""Our separation is necessary,"" replied her mother. ""Severalconsiderations have greatly changed my future. I am now poor. You willlead a brilliant life in Paris, and I could not live with you suitablywithout spending the little that remains to me. Whereas, if I go toLanstrac, I can take care of your property there and restore my fortuneby economy.""""You, mamma! _You_ practise economy!"" cried Natalie, laughing. ""Don\'tbegin to be a grandmother yet. What! do you mean to leave me for suchreasons as those? Dear mother, Paul may seem to you a trifle stupid, buthe is not one atom selfish or grasping.""""Ah!"" replied Madame Evangelista, in a tone of voice big withsuggestions which made the girl\'s heart throb, ""those discussions aboutthe contract have made me distrustful. I have my doubts about him--Butdon\'t be troubled, dear child,"" she added, taking her daughter by theneck and kissing her. ""I will not leave you long alone. Whenever myreturn can take place without making difficulty between you, wheneverPaul can rightly judge me, we will begin once more our happy littlelife, our evening confidences--""""Oh! mother, how can you think of living without your Natalie?""""Because, dear angel, I shall live for her. My mother\'s heart will besatisfied in the thought that I contribute, as I ought, to your futurehappiness.""""But, my dear, adorable mother, must I be alone with Paul, here, now,all at once? What will become of me? what will happen? what must I do?what must I not do?""""Poor child! do you think that I would utterly abandon you to your firstbattle? We will write to each other three times a week like lovers.We shall thus be close to each other\'s hearts incessantly. Nothingcan happen to you that I shall not know, and I can save you from allmisfortune. Besides, it would be too ridiculous if I never went to seeyou; it would seem to show dislike or disrespect to your husband; I willalways spend a month or two every year with you in Paris.""""Alone, already alone, and with him!"" cried Natalie in terror,interrupting her mother.""But you wish to be his wife?""""Yes, I wish it. But tell me how I should behave,--you, who did what youpleased with my father. You know the way; I\'ll obey you blindly.""Madame Evangelista kissed her daughter\'s forehead. She had willed andawaited this request.""Child, my counsels must adept themselves to circumstances. All menare not alike. The lion and the frog are not more unlike than one mancompared with another,--morally, I mean. Do I know to-day what willhappen to you to-morrow? No; therefore I can only give you generaladvice upon the whole tenor of your conduct.""""Dear mother, tell me, quick, all that you know yourself.""""In the first place, my dear child, the cause of the failure of marriedwomen who desire to keep their husbands\' hearts--and,"" she said, makinga parenthesis, ""to keep their hearts and rule them is one and the samething--Well, the principle cause of conjugal disunion is to be found inperpetual intercourse, which never existed in the olden time, but whichhas been introduced into this country of late years with the mania forfamily. Since the Revolution the manners and customs of the bourgeoishave invaded the homes of the aristocracy. This misfortune is due to oneof their writers, Rousseau, an infamous heretic, whose ideas were allanti-social and who pretended, I don\'t know how, to justify the mostsenseless things. He declared that all women had the same rights andthe same faculties; that living in a state of society we ought,nevertheless, to obey nature--as if the wife of a Spanish grandee, asif you or I had anything in common with the women of the people! Sincethen, well-bred women have suckled their children, have educated theirdaughters, and stayed in their own homes. Life has become so involvedthat happiness is almost impossible,--for a perfect harmony betweennatures such as that which has made you and me live as two friends is anexception. Perpetual contact is as dangerous for parents and children asit is for husband and wife. There are few souls in which love survivesthis fatal omnipresence. Therefore, I say, erect between yourself andPaul the barriers of society; go to balls and operas; go out in themorning, dine out in the evenings, pay visits constantly, and grant butlittle of your time to your husband. By this means you will always keepyour value to him. When two beings bound together for life havenothing to live upon but sentiment, its resources are soon exhausted,indifference, satiety, and disgust succeed. When sentiment has witheredwhat will become of you? Remember, affection once extinguished can leadto nothing but indifference or contempt. Be ever young and ever new tohim. He may weary you,--that often happens,--but you must never wearyhim. The faculty of being bored without showing it is a condition ofall species of power. You cannot diversify happiness by the cares ofproperty or the occupations of a family. If you do not make your husbandshare your social interests, if you do not keep him amused you will fallinto a dismal apathy. Then begins the SPLEEN of love. But a man willalways love the woman who amuses him and keeps him happy. To givehappiness and to receive it are two lines of feminine conduct which areseparated by a gulf.""""Dear mother, I am listening to you, but I don\'t understand one word yousay.""""If you love Paul to the extent of doing all he asks of you, if you makeyour happiness depend on him, all is over with your future life; youwill never be mistress of your home, and the best precepts in the worldwill do you no good.""""That is plainer; but I see the rule without knowing how to apply it,""said Natalie, laughing. ""I have the theory; the practice will come.""""My poor Ninie,"" replied the mother, who dropped an honest tear at thethought of her daughter\'s marriage, ""things will happen to teach it toyou--And,"" she continued, after a pause, during which the mother anddaughter held each other closely embraced in the truest sympathy,""remember this, my Natalie: we all have our destiny as women, just asmen have their vocation as men. A woman is born to be a woman of theworld and a charming hostess, as a man is born to be a general or apoet. Your vocation is to please. Your education has formed you forsociety. In these days women should be educated for the salon as theyonce were for the gynoecium. You were not born to be the mother of afamily or the steward of a household. If you have children, I hopethey will not come to spoil your figure on the morrow of your marriage;nothing is so bourgeois as to have a child at once. If you have themtwo or three years after your marriage, well and good; governesses andtutors will bring them up. YOU are to be the lady, the great lady, whorepresents the luxury and the pleasure of the house. But rememberone thing--let your superiority be visible in those things only whichflatter a man\'s self-love; hide the superiority you must also acquireover him in great things.""""But you frighten me, mamma,"" cried Natalie. ""How can I rememberall these precepts? How shall I ever manage, I, such a child, and soheedless, to reflect and calculate before I act?""""But, my dear little girl, I am telling you to-day that which you mustsurely learn later, buying your experience by fatal faults and errorsof conduct which will cause you bitter regrets and embarrass your wholelife.""""But how must I begin?"" asked Natalie, artlessly.""Instinct will guide you,"" replied her mother. ""At this moment Pauldesires you more than he loves you; for love born of desires is a hope;the love that succeeds their satisfaction is the reality. There, mydear, is the question; there lies your power. What woman is not lovedbefore marriage? Be so on the morrow and you shall remain so always.Paul is a weak man who is easily trained to habit. If he yields to youonce he will yield always. A woman ardently desired can ask all things;do not commit the folly of many women who do not see the importance ofthe first hours of their sway,--that of wasting your power on trifles,on silly things with no result. Use the empire your husband\'s firstemotions give you to accustom him to obedience. And when you make himyield, choose that it be on some unreasonable point, so as to test themeasure of your power by the measure of his concession. What victorywould there be in making him agree to a reasonable thing? Would thatbe obeying you? We must always, as the Castilian proverb says, takethe bull by the horns; when a bull has once seen the inutility of hisdefence and of his strength he is beaten. When your husband does afoolish thing for you, you can govern him.""""Why so?""""Because, my child, marriage lasts a lifetime, and a husband is not aman like other men. Therefore, never commit the folly of giving yourselfinto his power in everything. Keep up a constant reserve in your speechand in your actions. You may even be cold to him without danger, for youcan modify coldness at will. Besides, nothing is more easy to maintainthan our dignity. The words, \'It is not becoming in your wife to do thusand so,\' is a great talisman. The life of a woman lies in the words, \'Iwill not.\' They are the final argument. Feminine power is in them,and therefore they should only be used on real occasions. But theyconstitute a means of governing far beyond that of argument ordiscussion. I, my dear child, reigned over your father by his faith inme. If your husband believes in you, you can do all things with him. Toinspire that belief you must make him think that you understand him. Donot suppose that that is an easy thing to do. A woman can always make aman think that he is loved, but to make him admit that he is understoodis far more difficult. I am bound to tell you all now, my child, forto-morrow life with its complications, life with two wills which_must_ be made one, begins for you. Bear in mind, at all moments, thatdifficulty. The only means of harmonizing your two wills is to arrangefrom the first that there shall be but one; and that will must be yours.Many persons declare that a wife creates her own unhappiness by changingsides in this way; but, my dear, she can only become the mistressby controlling events instead of bearing them; and that advantagecompensates for any difficulty.""Natalie kissed her mother\'s hands with tears of gratitude. Like allwomen in whom mental emotion is never warmed by physical emotion, shesuddenly comprehended the bearings of this feminine policy; but, likea spoiled child that never admits the force of reason and returnsobstinately to its one desire, she came back to the charge with one ofthose personal arguments which the logic of a child suggests:--""Dear mamma,"" she said, ""it is only a few days since you were talkingof Paul\'s advancement, and saying that you alone could promote it; why,then, do you suddenly turn round and abandon us to ourselves?""""I did not then know the extent of my obligations nor the amount of mydebts,"" replied the mother, who would not suffer her real motive to beseen. ""Besides, a year or two hence I can take up that matter again.Come, let us dress; Paul will be here soon. Be as sweet and caressingas you were,--you know?--that night when we first discussed this fatalcontract; for to-day we must save the last fragments of our fortune, andI must win for you a thing to which I am superstitiously attached.""""What is it?""""The \'Discreto.\'""Paul arrived about four o\'clock. Though he endeavored to meet hismother-in-law with a gracious look upon his face, Madame Evangelista sawtraces of the clouds which the counsels of the night and the reflectionsof the morning had brought there.""Mathias has told him!"" she thought, resolving to defeat the oldnotary\'s action. ""My dear son,"" she said, ""you left your diamonds in thedrawer of the console, and I frankly confess that I would rather not seeagain the things that threatened to bring a cloud between us. Besides,as Monsieur Mathias said, they ought to be sold at once to meet thefirst payment on the estates you have purchased.""""They are not mine,"" he said. ""I have given them to Natalie, and whenyou see them upon her you will forget the pain they caused you.""Madame Evangelista took his hand and pressed it cordially, with a tearof emotion.""Listen to me, my dear children,"" she said, looking from Paul toNatalie; ""since you really feel thus, I have a proposition to make toboth of you. I find myself obliged to sell my pearl necklace and myearrings. Yes, Paul, it is necessary; I do not choose to put a penny ofmy fortune into an annuity; I know what I owe to you. Well, I admita weakness; to sell the \'Discreto\' seems to me a disaster. To sell adiamond which bears the name of Philip the Second and once adorned hisroyal hand, an historic stone which the Duke of Alba touched for tenyears in the hilt of his sword--no, no, I cannot! Elie Magus estimatesmy necklace and ear-rings at a hundred and some odd thousand francswithout the clasps. Will you exchange the other jewels I made over toyou for these? you will gain by the transaction, but what of that? I amnot selfish. Instead of those mere fancy jewels, Paul, your wife willhave fine diamonds which she can really enjoy. Isn\'t it better that Ishould sell those ornaments which will surely go out of fashion, andthat you should keep in the family these priceless stones?""""But, my dear mother, consider yourself,"" said Paul.""I,"" replied Madame Evangelista, ""I want such things no longer. Yes,Paul, I am going to be your bailiff at Lanstrac. It would be folly inme to go to Paris at the moment when I ought to be here to liquidatemy property and settle my affairs. I shall grow miserly for mygrandchildren.""""Dear mother,"" said Paul, much moved, ""ought I to accept this exchangewithout paying you the difference?""""Good heavens! are you not, both of you, my dearest interests? Doyou suppose I shall not find happiness in thinking, as I sit in mychimney-corner, \'Natalie is dazzling to-night at the Duchesse de Berry\'sball\'? When she sees my diamond at her throat and my ear-rings inher ears she will have one of those little enjoyments of vanity whichcontribute so much to a woman\'s happiness and make her so gay andfascinating. Nothing saddens a woman more than to have her vanityrepressed; I have never seen an ill-dressed woman who was amiable orgood-humored.""""Heavens! what was Mathias thinking about?"" thought Paul. ""Well, then,mamma,"" he said, in a low voice, ""I accept.""""But I am confounded!"" said Natalie.At this moment Solonet arrived to announce the good news that he hadfound among the speculators of Bordeaux two contractors who were muchattracted by the house, the gardens of which could be covered withdwellings.""They offer two hundred and fifty thousand francs,"" he said; ""but if youconsent to the sale, I can make them give you three hundred thousand.There are three acres of land in the garden.""""My husband paid two hundred thousand for the place, therefore Iconsent,"" she replied. ""But you must reserve the furniture and themirrors.""""Ah!"" said Solonet, ""you are beginning to understand business.""""Alas! I must,"" she said, sighing.""I am told that a great many persons are coming to your midnightservice,"" said Solonet, perceiving that his presence was inopportune,and preparing to go.Madame Evangelista accompanied him to the door of the last salon, andthere she said, in a low voice:--""I now have personal property to the amount of two hundred and fiftythousand francs; if I can get two hundred thousand for my share of thehouse it will make a handsome capital, which I shall want to invest tothe very best advantage. I count on you for that. I shall probably liveat Lanstrac.""The young notary kissed his client\'s hand with a gesture of gratitude;for the widow\'s tone of voice made Solonet fancy that this alliance,really made from self-interest only, might extend a little farther.""You can count on me,"" he replied. ""I can find you investments inmerchandise on which you will risk nothing and make very considerableprofits.""""Adieu until to-morrow,"" she said; ""you are to be our witness, you know,with Monsieur le Marquis de Gyas.""""My dear mother,"" said Paul, when she returned to them, ""why do yourefuse to come to Paris? Natalie is provoked with me, as if I were thecause of your decision.""""I have thought it all over, my children, and I am sure that I shouldhamper you. You would feel obliged to make me a third in all you did,and young people have ideas of their own which I might, unintentionally,thwart. Go to Paris. I do not wish to exercise over the Comtesse deManerville the gentle authority I have held over Natalie. I desire toleave her wholly to you. Don\'t you see, Paul, that there are habits andways between us which must be broken up? My influence ought to yield toyours. I want you to love me, and to believe that I have your interestsmore at heart than you think for. Young husbands are, sooner or later,jealous for the love of a wife for her mother. Perhaps they are right.When you are thoroughly united, when love has blended your two soulsinto one, then, my dear son, you will not fear an opposing influence ifI live in your house. I know the world, and men, and things; I have seenthe peace of many a home destroyed by the blind love of mothers whomade themselves in the end as intolerable to their daughters as totheir sons-in-law. The affection of old people is often exacting andquerulous. Perhaps I could not efface myself as I should. I have theweakness to think myself still handsome; I have flatterers who declarethat I am still agreeable; I should have, I fear, certain pretensionswhich might interfere with your lives. Let me, therefore, make one moresacrifice for your happiness. I have given you my fortune, and now Idesire to resign to you my last vanities as a woman. Your notary Mathiasis getting old. He cannot look after your estates as I will. I will beyour bailiff; I will create for myself those natural occupations whichare the pleasures of old age. Later, if necessary, I will come to youin Paris, and second you in your projects of ambition. Come, Paul, befrank; my proposal suits you, does it not?""Paul would not admit it, but he was at heart delighted to get hisliberty. The suspicions which Mathias had put into his mind respectinghis mother-in-law were, however, dissipated by this conversation, whichMadame Evangelista carried on still longer in the same tone.""My mother was right,"" thought Natalie, who had watched Paul\'scountenance. ""He _is_ glad to know that I am separated from her--why?""That ""why"" was the first note of a rising distrust; did it prove thepower of those maternal instructions?There are certain characters which on the faith of a single proofbelieve in friendship. To persons thus constituted the north wind drivesaway the clouds as rapidly as the south wind brings them; they stop ateffects and never hark back to causes. Paul had one of those essentiallyconfiding natures, without ill-feelings, but also without foresight. Hisweakness proceeded far more from his kindness, his belief in goodness,than from actual debility of soul.Natalie was sad and thoughtful, for she knew not what to do withouther mother. Paul, with that self-confident conceit which comes of love,smiled to himself at her sadness, thinking how soon the pleasuresof marriage and the excitements of Paris would drive it away. MadameEvangelista saw this confidence with much satisfaction. She had alreadytaken two great steps. Her daughter possessed the diamonds which hadcost Paul two hundred thousand francs; and she had gained her point ofleaving these two children to themselves with no other guide than theirillogical love. Her revenge was thus preparing, unknown to her daughter,who would, sooner or later, become its accomplice. Did Natalie lovePaul? That was a question still undecided, the answer to which mightmodify her projects, for she loved her daughter too sincerely not torespect her happiness. Paul\'s future, therefore, still depended onhimself. If he could make his wife love him, he was saved.The next day, at midnight, after an evening spent together, with theaddition of the four witnesses, to whom Madame Evangelista gave theformal dinner which follows the legal marriage, the bridal pair,accompanied by their friends, heard mass by torchlight, in presence ofa crowd of inquisitive persons. A marriage celebrated at night alwayssuggests to the mind an unpleasant omen. Light is the symbol of life andpleasure, the forecasts of which are lacking to a midnight wedding. Askthe intrepid soul why it shivers; why the chill of those black archesenervates it; why the sound of steps startles it; why it notices the cryof bats and the hoot of owls. Though there is absolutely no reason totremble, all present do tremble, and the darkness, emblem of death,saddens them. Natalie, parted from her mother, wept. The girl was now aprey to those doubts which grasp the heart as it enters a new career inwhich, despite all assurances of happiness, a thousand pitfalls awaitthe steps of a young wife. She was cold and wanted a mantle. The air andmanner of Madame Evangelista and that of the bridal pair excited somecomment among the elegant crowd which surrounded the altar.""Solonet tells me that the bride and bridegroom leave for Paristo-morrow morning, all alone.""""Madame Evangelista was to live with them, I thought.""""Count Paul has got rid of her already.""""What a mistake!"" said the Marquise de Gyas. ""To shut the door on themother of his wife is to open it to a lover. Doesn\'t he know what amother is?""""He has been very hard on Madame Evangelista; the poor woman has had tosell her house and her diamonds, and is going to live at Lanstrac.""""Natalie looks very sad.""""Would you like to be made to take a journey the day after yourmarriage?""""It is very awkward.""""I am glad I came here to-night,"" said a lady. ""I am now convinced ofthe necessity of the pomps of marriage and of wedding fetes; a scenelike this is very bare and sad. If I may say what I think,"" she added,in a whisper to her neighbor, ""this marriage seems to me indecent.""Madame Evangelista took Natalie in her carriage and accompanied her,alone, to Paul\'s house.""Well, mother, it is done!""""Remember, my dear child, my last advice, and you will be a happy woman.Be his wife, and not his mistress.""When Natalie had retired, the mother played the little comedy offlinging herself with tears into the arms of her son-in-law. It was theonly provincial thing that Madame Evangelista allowed herself, but shehad her reasons for it. Amid tears and speeches, apparently halfwild and despairing, she obtained of Paul those concessions which allhusbands make.The next day she put the married pair into their carriage, andaccompanied them to the ferry, by which the road to Paris crosses theGironde. With a look and a word Natalie enabled her mother to see thatif Paul had won the trick in the game of the contract, her revengewas beginning. Natalie was already reducing her husband to perfectobedience.']"
81,7,Chapter 7,"['VI. CONCLUSION Five years later, on an afternoon in the month of November, Comte Paulde Manerville, wrapped in a cloak, was entering, with a bowed head anda mysterious manner, the house of his old friend Monsieur Mathias atBordeaux.Too old to continue in business, the worthy notary had sold his practiceand was ending his days peacefully in a quiet house to which he hadretired. An urgent affair had obliged him to be absent at the moment ofhis guest\'s arrival, but his housekeeper, warned of Paul\'s coming, tookhim to the room of the late Madame Mathias, who had been dead a year.Fatigued by a rapid journey, Paul slept till evening. When the old manreached home he went up to his client\'s room, and watched him sleeping,as a mother watches her child. Josette, the old housekeeper, followedher master and stood before the bed, her hands on her hips.""It is a year to-day, Josette, since I received my dear wife\'s lastsigh; I little knew then that I should stand here again to see the counthalf dead.""""Poor man! he moans in his sleep,"" said Josette.""Sac a papier!"" cried the old notary, an innocent oath which was asign with him of the despair on a man of business before insurmountabledifficulties. ""At any rate,"" he thought, ""I have saved the title to theLanstrac estate for him, and that of Ausac, Saint-Froult, and his house,though the usufruct has gone."" Mathias counted his fingers. ""Five years!Just five years this month, since his old aunt, now dead, that excellentMadame de Maulincour, asked for the hand of that little crocodile of awoman, who has finally ruined him--as I expected.""And the gouty old gentleman, leaning on his cane, went to walk in thelittle garden till his guest should awake. At nine o\'clock supperwas served, for Mathias took supper. The old man was not a littleastonished, when Paul joined him, to see that his old client\'s brow wascalm and his face serene, though noticeably changed. If at the age ofthirty-three the Comte de Manerville seemed to be a man of forty, thatchange in his appearance was due solely to mental shocks; physically, hewas well. He clasped the old man\'s hand affectionately, and forced himnot to rise, saying:--""Dear, kind Maitre Mathias, you, too, have had your troubles.""""Mine were natural troubles, Monsieur le comte; but yours--""""We will talk of that presently, while we sup.""""If I had not a son in the magistracy, and a daughter married,"" said thegood old man, ""you would have found in old Mathias, believe me, Monsieurle comte, something better than mere hospitality. Why have you come toBordeaux at the very moment when posters are on all the walls of theseizure of your farms at Grassol and Guadet, the vineyard of Belle-Roseand the family mansion? I cannot tell you the grief I feel at the sightof those placards,--I, who for forty years nursed that property as if itbelonged to me; I, who bought it for your mother when I was only thirdclerk to Monsieur Chesnau, my predecessor, and wrote the deeds myselfin my best round hand; I, who have those titles now in my successor\'soffice; I, who have known you since you were so high""; and the old manstopped to put his hand near the ground. ""Ah! a man must have been anotary for forty-one years and a half to know the sort of grief I feelto see my name exposed before the face of Israel in those announcementsof the seizure and sale of the property. When I pass through the streetsand see men reading these horrible yellow posters, I am ashamed, as ifmy own honor and ruin were concerned. Some fools will stand there andread them aloud expressly to draw other fools about them--and whatimbecile remarks they make! As if a man were not master of his ownproperty! Your father ran through two fortunes before he made the onehe left you; and you wouldn\'t be a Manerville if you didn\'t do likewise.Besides, seizures of real estate have a whole section of the Code tothemselves; they are expected and provided for; you are in a positionrecognized by the law.--If I were not an old man with white hair, Iwould thrash those fools I hear reading aloud in the streets such anabomination as this,"" added the worthy notary, taking up a paper; ""\'Atthe request of Dame Natalie Evangelista, wife of Paul-Francois-Joseph,Comte de Manerville, separated from him as to worldly goods and chattelsby the Lower court of the department of the Seine--\'""""Yes, and now separated in body,"" said Paul.""Ah!"" exclaimed the old man.""Oh! against my wife\'s will,"" added the count, hastily. ""I was forced todeceive her; she did not know that I was leaving her.""""You have left her?""""My passage is taken; I sail for Calcutta on the \'Belle-Amelie.\'""""Two day\'s hence!"" cried the notary. ""Then, Monsieur le comte, we shallnever meet again.""""You are only seventy-three, my dear Mathias, and you have the gout, thebrevet of old age. When I return I shall find you still afoot. Yourgood head and heart will be as sound as ever, and you will help meto reconstruct what is now a shaken edifice. I intend to make a noblefortune in seven years. I shall be only forty on my return. All is stillpossible at that age.""""You?"" said Mathias, with a gesture of amazement,--you, Monsieur lecomte, to undertake commerce! How can you even think of it?""""I am no longer Monsieur le comte, dear Mathias. My passage is takenunder the name of Camille, one of my mother\'s baptismal names. I haveacquirements which will enable me to make my fortune otherwise than inbusiness. Commerce, at any rate, will be only my final chance. I startwith a sum in hand sufficient for the redemption of my future on a largescale.""""Where is that money?""""A friend is to send it to me.""The old man dropped his fork as he heard the word ""friend,"" not insurprise, not scoffingly, but in grief; his look and manner expressedthe pain he felt in finding Paul under the influence of a deceitfulillusion; his practised eye fathomed a gulf where the count saw nothingbut solid ground.""I have been fifty years in the notariat,"" he said, ""and I never yetknew a ruined man whose friend would lend him money.""""You don\'t know de Marsay. I am certain that he has sold out some of hisinvestments already, and to-morrow you will receive from him a bill ofexchange for one hundred and fifty thousand francs.""""I hope I may. If that be so, cannot your friend settle yourdifficulties here? You could live quietly at Lanstrac for five or sixyears on your wife\'s income, and so recover yourself.""""No assignment or economy on my part could pay off fifteen hundredthousand francs of debt, in which my wife is involved to the amount offive hundred and fifty thousand.""""You cannot mean to say that in four years you have incurred a millionand a half of debt?""""Nothing is more certain, Mathias. Did I not give those diamonds to mywife? Did I not spend the hundred and fifty thousand I received from thesale of Madame Evangelista\'s house, in the arrangement of my house inParis? Was I not forced to use other money for the first payments onthat property demanded by the marriage contract? I was even forced tosell out Natalie\'s forty thousand a year in the Funds to complete thepurchase of Auzac and Saint-Froult. We sold at eighty-seven, therefore Ibecame in debt for over two hundred thousand francs within a month aftermy marriage. That left us only sixty-seven thousand francs a year; butwe spent fully three times as much every year.

What next?""""Well, I wanted, in the first place, to complete for my wife that setof jewels of which she had the pearl necklace clasped by the familydiamond, the \'Discreto,\' and her mother\'s ear-rings.

82,1,Chapter 1,"[""Produced by Charles Keller and David WidgerMEN OF IRONby Howard PyleINTRODUCTIONThe year 1400 opened with more than usual peacefulness in England. Onlya few months before, Richard II--weak, wicked, and treacherous--had beendethroned, and Henry IV declared King in his stead. But it was only aseeming peacefulness, lasting but for a little while; for though KingHenry proved himself a just and a merciful man--as justice and mercywent with the men of iron of those days--and though he did not careto shed blood needlessly, there were many noble families who had beenbenefited by King Richard during his reign, and who had lost somewhat oftheir power and prestige from the coming in of the new King.Among these were a number of great lords--the Dukes of Albemarle,Surrey, and Exeter, the Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Gloucester, andothers--who had been degraded to their former titles and estates, fromwhich King Richard had lifted them. These and others brewed a secretplot to take King Henry's life, which plot might have succeeded had notone of their own number betrayed them.Their plan had been to fall upon the King and his adherents, and tomassacre them during a great tournament, to be held at Oxford. But Henrydid not appear at the lists; whereupon, knowing that he had been lodgingat Windsor with only a few attendants, the conspirators marched thitheragainst him. In the mean time the King had been warned of the plot,so that, instead of finding him in the royal castle, they discoveredthrough their scouts that he had hurried to London, whence he waseven then marching against them at the head of a considerable army. Sonothing was left them but flight. Some betook themselves one way, someanother; some sought sanctuary here, some there; but one and another,they were all of them caught and killed.The Earl of Kent--one time Duke of Surrey--and the Earl ofSalisbury were beheaded in the market-place at Cirencester; Lord LeDespencer--once the Earl of Gloucester--and Lord Lumley met the samefate at Bristol; the Earl of Huntingdon was taken in the Essex fens,carried to the castle of the Duke of Gloucester, whom he had betrayedto his death in King Richard's time, and was there killed by the castlepeople. Those few who found friends faithful and bold enough to affordthem shelter, dragged those friends down in their own ruin.Just such a case was that of the father of the boy hero of thisstory, the blind Lord Gilbert Reginald Falworth, Baron of Falworth andEasterbridge, who, though having no part in the plot, suffered throughit ruin, utter and complete.He had been a faithful counsellor and adviser to King Richard, andperhaps it was this, as much and more than his roundabout connectionwith the plot, that brought upon him the punishment he suffered.""]"
82,2,Chapter 2,"['1Myles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time, and it was onlyafterwards, and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outsof the matter, that he could remember by bits and pieces the things thatafterwards happened; how one evening a knight came clattering into thecourt-yard upon a horse, red-nostrilled and smeared with the sweat andfoam of a desperate ride--Sir John Dale, a dear friend of the blindLord.Even though so young, Myles knew that something very serious hadhappened to make Sir John so pale and haggard, and he dimly rememberedleaning against the knight\'s iron-covered knees, looking up into hisgloomy face, and asking him if he was sick to look so strange. Thereuponthose who had been too troubled before to notice him, bethoughtthemselves of him, and sent him to bed, rebellious at having to go soearly.He remembered how the next morning, looking out of a window high upunder the eaves, he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into thecourtyard beneath, where a powdering of snow had whitened everything,and of how the leader, a knight clad in black armor, dismounted andentered the great hall door-way below, followed by several of the band.He remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightenedgroup upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voicesabout a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men whohad ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale. None of thewomen paid any attention to him; so, shunning their notice, he ran offdown the winding stairs, expecting every moment to be called back againby some one of them.A crowd of castle people, all very serious and quiet, were gatheredin the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon thebenches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stoodguarding the great door, the butts of their weapons resting upon theground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.In the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen fromthe window. He was sitting at the table, his great helmet lying uponthe bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. Aclerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one handand pen in the other, and a parchment spread in front of him.Master Robert, the castle steward, stood before the knight, who everynow and then put to him a question, which the other would answer, andthe clerk write the answer down upon the parchment.His father stood with his back to the fireplace, looking down upon thefloor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and thescar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament atYork--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across hisforehead, as it always did when he was angered or troubled.There was something about it all that frightened Myles, who crept to hisfather\'s side, and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp andinert. In answer to the touch, his father grasped the hand tightly,but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there. Neither didthe black knight pay any attention to him, but continued putting hisquestions to Master Robert.Then, suddenly, there was a commotion in the hall without, loud voices,and a hurrying here and there. The black knight half arose, grasping aheavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him, and the next momentSir John Dale himself, as pale as death, walked into the antechamber. Hestopped in the very middle of the room. ""I yield me to my Lord\'s graceand mercy,"" said he to the black knight, and they were the last words heever uttered in this world.The black knight shouted out some words of command, and swinging up theiron mace in his hand, strode forward clanking towards Sir John, whoraised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow. Two or threeof those who stood in the hall without came running into the room withdrawn swords and bills, and little Myles, crying out with terror, hidhis face in his father\'s long gown.The next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan, thenanother blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground. Then theclashing of steel, and in the midst Lord Falworth crying, in a dreadfulvoice, ""Thou traitor! thou coward! thou murderer!""Master Robert snatched Myles away from his father, and bore him out ofthe room in spite of his screams and struggles, and he remembered justone instant\'s sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face,and of the black knight standing above him, with the terrible mace inhis hand stained a dreadful red.It was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles,together with three of the more faithful of their people, left thecastle.His memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowmanstanding over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in hishand, and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he wouldhave spoken, and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women,bewildered with sleep, shuddering and chattering with cold.He remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot ofhis bed, and of being carried in Diccon Bowman\'s arms down the silentdarkness of the winding stair-way, with the great black giant shadowsswaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lampswayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air.Below were his father and mother and two or three others. A strangerstood warming his hands at a newly-made fire, and little Myles, as hepeeped from out the warm sheepskin, saw that he was in riding-boots andwas covered with mud. He did not know till long years afterwards thatthe stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King\'s court,bidding his father fly for safety.They who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still,talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes, and Myles\'s mother huggedhim in her arms, sheepskin and all, kissing him, with the tearsstreaming down her cheeks, and whispering to him, as though he couldunderstand their trouble, that they were about to leave their homeforever.Then Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the wintermidnight.Outside, beyond the frozen moat, where the osiers, stood stark and stiffin their winter nakedness, was a group of dark figures waiting for themwith horses. In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well-knownface of Father Edward, the Prior of St. Mary\'s.After that came a long ride through that silent night upon thesaddle-bow in front of Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, thatfell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses.When next he woke the sun was shining, and his home and his whole lifewere changed.']"
82,3,Chapter 3,"['2From the time the family escaped from Falworth Castle that midwinternight to the time Myles was sixteen years old he knew nothing of thegreat world beyond Crosbey-Dale. A fair was held twice in a twelvemonthat the market-town of Wisebey, and three times in the seven years oldDiccon Bowman took the lad to see the sights at that place. Beyond thesethree glimpses of the outer world he lived almost as secluded a life asone of the neighboring monks of St. Mary\'s Priory.Crosbey-Holt, their new home, was different enough from Falworth orEasterbridge Castle, the former baronial seats of Lord Falworth. It wasa long, low, straw-thatched farm-house, once, when the church lands weredivided into two holdings, one of the bailiff\'s houses. All around werethe fruitful farms of the priory, tilled by well-to-do tenant holders,and rich with fields of waving grain, and meadow-lands where sheep andcattle grazed in flocks and herds; for in those days the church landswere under church rule, and were governed by church laws, and there,when war and famine and waste and sloth blighted the outside world,harvests flourished and were gathered, and sheep were sheared and cowswere milked in peace and quietness.The Prior of St. Mary\'s owed much if not all of the church\'s prosperityto the blind Lord Falworth, and now he was paying it back with a havenof refuge from the ruin that his former patron had brought upon himselfby giving shelter to Sir John Dale.I fancy that most boys do not love the grinding of school life--thelessons to be conned, the close application during study hours. It isnot often pleasant to brisk, lively lads to be so cooped up. I wonderwhat the boys of to-day would have thought of Myles\'s training. With himthat training was not only of the mind, but of the body as well, and forseven years it was almost unremitting. ""Thou hast thine own way tomake in the world, sirrah,"" his father said more than once when the boycomplained of the grinding hardness of his life, and to make one\'s wayin those days meant a thousand times more than it does now; it meant notonly a heart to feel and a brain to think, but a hand quick and strongto strike in battle, and a body tough to endure the wounds and blows inreturn. And so it was that Myles\'s body as well as his mind had to betrained to meet the needs of the dark age in which he lived.Every morning, winter or summer, rain or shine he tramped away six longmiles to the priory school, and in the evenings his mother taught himFrench.Myles, being prejudiced in the school of thought of his day, rebellednot a little at that last branch of his studies. ""Why must I learn thatvile tongue?"" said he.""Call it not vile,"" said the blind old Lord, grimly; ""belike, when thouart grown a man, thou\'lt have to seek thy fortune in France land, forEngland is haply no place for such as be of Falworth blood."" And inafter-years, true to his father\'s prediction, the ""vile tongue"" servedhim well.As for his physical training, that pretty well filled up the hoursbetween his morning studies at the monastery and his evening studiesat home. Then it was that old Diccon Bowman took him in hand, than whomnone could be better fitted to shape his young body to strength and hishands to skill in arms. The old bowman had served with Lord Falworth\'sfather under the Black Prince both in France and Spain, and in longyears of war had gained a practical knowledge of arms that few couldsurpass. Besides the use of the broadsword, the short sword, thequarter-staff, and the cudgel, he taught Myles to shoot so skilfullywith the long-bow and the cross-bow that not a lad in the country-sidewas his match at the village butts. Attack and defence with the lance,and throwing the knife and dagger were also part of his training.Then, in addition to this more regular part of his physical training,Myles was taught in another branch not so often included in the militaryeducation of the day--the art of wrestling. It happened that a fellowlived in Crosbey village, by name Ralph-the-Smith, who was the greatestwrestler in the country-side, and had worn the champion belt for threeyears. Every Sunday afternoon, in fair weather, he came to teach Mylesthe art, and being wonderfully adept in bodily feats, he soon grew soquick and active and firm-footed that he could cast any lad under twentyyears of age living within a range of five miles.""It is main ungentle armscraft that he learneth,"" said Lord Falworth oneday to Prior Edward. ""Saving only the broadsword, the dagger, and thelance, there is but little that a gentleman of his strain may use.Neth\'less, he gaineth quickness and suppleness, and if he hath trueblood in his veins he will acquire knightly arts shrewdly quick when thetime cometh to learn them.""But hard and grinding as Myles\'s life was, it was not entirely withoutpleasures. There were many boys living in Crosbey-Dale and the village;yeomen\'s and farmers\' sons, to be sure, but, nevertheless, lads of hisown age, and that, after all, is the main requirement for friendship inboyhood\'s world. Then there was the river to bathe in; there were thehills and valleys to roam over, and the wold and woodland, with theirwealth of nuts and birds\'-nests and what not of boyhood\'s treasures.Once he gained a triumph that for many a day was very sweet under thetongue of his memory. As was said before, he had been three times to themarket-town at fair-time, and upon the last of these occasions he hadfought a bout of quarterstaff with a young fellow of twenty, and hadbeen the conqueror. He was then only a little over fourteen years old.Old Diccon, who had gone with him to the fair, had met some cronies ofhis own, with whom he had sat gossiping in the ale-booth, leaving Mylesfor the nonce to shift for himself. By-and-by the old man had noticeda crowd gathered at one part of the fair-ground, and, snuffing a fight,had gone running, ale-pot in hand. Then, peering over the shoulders ofthe crowd, he had seen his young master, stripped to the waist, fightinglike a gladiator with a fellow a head taller than himself. Diccon wasabout to force his way through the crowd and drag them asunder, but asecond look had showed his practised eye that Myles was not only holdinghis own, but was in the way of winning the victory. So he had stood withthe others looking on, withholding himself from any interference andwhatever upbraiding might be necessary until the fight had been broughtto a triumphant close. Lord Falworth never heard directly of theredoubtable affair, but old Diccon was not so silent with the commonfolk of Crosbey-Dale, and so no doubt the father had some inkling ofwhat had happened. It was shortly after this notable event that Myleswas formally initiated into squirehood. His father and mother, as wasthe custom, stood sponsors for him. By them, each bearing a lightedtaper, he was escorted to the altar. It was at St. Mary\'s Priory, andPrior Edward blessed the sword and girded it to the lad\'s side. Noone was present but the four, and when the good Prior had given thebenediction and had signed the cross upon his forehead, Myles\'s motherstooped and kissed his brow just where the priest\'s finger had drawn theholy sign. Her eyes brimmed bright with tears as she did so. Poorlady! perhaps she only then and for the first time realized how big herfledgling was growing for his nest. Henceforth Myles had the right towear a sword.Myles had ended his fifteenth year. He was a bonny lad, with brown face,curling hair, a square, strong chin, and a pair of merry laughingblue eyes; his shoulders were broad; his chest was thick of girth; hismuscles and thews were as tough as oak.The day upon which he was sixteen years old, as he came whistling homefrom the monastery school he was met by Diccon Bowman.""Master Myles,"" said the old man, with a snuffle in his voice--""MasterMyles, thy father would see thee in his chamber, and bade me send theeto him as soon as thou didst come home. Oh, Master Myles, I fear me thatbelike thou art going to leave home to-morrow day.""Myles stopped short. ""To leave home!"" he cried.""Aye,"" said old Diccon, ""belike thou goest to some grand castle tolive there, and be a page there and what not, and then, haply, agentleman-at-arms in some great lord\'s pay.""""What coil is this about castles and lords and gentlemen-at-arms?"" saidMyles. ""What talkest thou of, Diccon? Art thou jesting?""""Nay,"" said Diccon, ""I am not jesting. But go to thy father, and thenthou wilt presently know all. Only this I do say, that it is like thouleavest us to-morrow day.""And so it was as Diccon had said; Myles was to leave home the verynext morning. He found his father and mother and Prior Edward together,waiting for his coming.""We three have been talking it over this morning,"" said his father, ""andso think each one that the time hath come for thee to quit this poorhome of ours. An thou stay here ten years longer, thou\'lt be no more fitto go then than now. To-morrow I will give thee a letter to my kinsman,the Earl of Mackworth. He has thriven in these days and I have fallenaway, but time was that he and I were true sworn companions, andplighted together in friendship never to be sundered. Methinks, as Iremember him, he will abide by his plighted troth, and will give theehis aid to rise in the world. So, as I said, to-morrow morning thoushalt set forth with Diccon Bowman, and shall go to Castle Devlen, andthere deliver this letter which prayeth him to give thee a place in hishousehold. Thou mayst have this afternoon to thyself to make read suchthings as thou shalt take with thee. And bid me Diccon to take the grayhorse to the village and have it shod.""Prior Edward had been standing looking out of the window. As LordFalworth ended he turned.""And, Myles,"" said he, ""thou wilt need some money, so I will give theeas a loan forty shillings, which some day thou mayst return to me anthou wilt. For this know, Myles, a man cannot do in the world withoutmoney. Thy father hath it ready for thee in the chest, and will give itthee to-morrow ere thou goest.""Lord Falworth had the grim strength of manhood\'s hard sense to upbearhim in sending his son into the world, but the poor lady mother hadnothing of that to uphold her. No doubt it was as hard then as it isnow for the mother to see the nestling thrust from the nest to shift foritself. What tears were shed, what words of love were spoken to the onlyman-child, none but the mother and the son ever knew.The next morning Myles and the old bowman rode away, and no doubt tothe boy himself the dark shadows of leave-taking were lost in the goldenlight of hope as he rode out into the great world to seek his fortune.']"
82,4,Chapter 4,"['3WHAT MYLES remembered of Falworth loomed great and grand and big, asthings do in the memory of childhood, but even memory could not makeFalworth the equal of Devlen Castle, when, as he and Diccon Bowman rodeout of Devlentown across the great, rude stone bridge that spanned theriver, he first saw, rising above the crowns of the trees, thosehuge hoary walls, and the steep roofs and chimneys clustered thicklytogether, like the roofs and chimneys of a town.The castle was built upon a plateau-like rise of ground, which wasenclosed by the outer wall. It was surrounded on three sides by aloop-like bend of the river, and on the fourth was protected by a deep,broad, artificial moat, almost as wide as the stream from which it wasfed. The road from the town wound for a little distance along by theedge of this moat. As Myles and the old bowman galloped by, with theanswering echo of their horses\' hoof-beats rattling back from the smoothstone face of the walls, the lad looked up, wondering at the height andstrength of the great ancient fortress. In his air-castle building Myleshad pictured the Earl receiving him as the son of his one-time comradein arms--receiving him, perhaps, with somewhat of the rustic warmth thathe knew at Crosbey-Dale; but now, as he stared at those massive wallsfrom below, and realized his own insignificance and the greatness ofthis great Earl, he felt the first keen, helpless ache of homesicknessshoot through his breast, and his heart yearned for Crosbey-Holt again.Then they thundered across the bridge that spanned the moat, and throughthe dark shadows of the great gaping gate-way, and Diccon, bidding himstay for a moment, rode forward to bespeak the gate-keeper.The gate-keeper gave the two in charge of one of the men-at-arms whowere lounging upon a bench in the archway, who in turn gave them intothe care of one of the house-servants in the outer court-yard. So,having been passed from one to another, and having answered manyquestions, Myles in due time found himself in the outer waiting-roomsitting beside Diccon Bowman upon a wooden bench that stood along thewall under the great arch of a glazed window.For a while the poor country lad sat stupidly bewildered. He was awareof people coming and going; he was aware of talk and laughter soundingaround him; but he thought of nothing but his aching homesickness andthe oppression of his utter littleness in the busy life of this greatcastle.Meantime old Diccon Bowman was staring about him with huge interest,every now and then nudging his young master, calling his attention nowto this and now to that, until at last the lad began to awaken somewhatfrom his despondency to the things around. Besides those servants andothers who came and went, and a knot of six or eight men-at-arms withbills and pole-axes, who stood at the farther door-way talking togetherin low tones, now and then broken by a stifled laugh, was a group offour young squires, who lounged upon a bench beside a door-way hidden byan arras, and upon them Myles\'s eyes lit with a sudden interest. Threeof the four were about his own age, one was a year or two older, andall four were dressed in the black-and-yellow uniform of the house ofBeaumont.Myles plucked the bowman by the sleeve. ""Be they squires, Diccon?"" saidhe, nodding towards the door.""Eh?"" said Diccon. ""Aye; they be squires.""""And will my station be with them?"" asked the boy.""Aye; an the Earl take thee to service, thou\'lt haply be taken assquire.""Myles stared at them, and then of a sudden was aware that the young menwere talking of him. He knew it by the way they eyed him askance, andspoke now and then in one another\'s ears. One of the four, a gay youngfellow, with long riding-boots laced with green laces, said a few words,the others gave a laugh, and poor Myles, knowing how ungainly he mustseem to them, felt the blood rush to his cheeks, and shyly turned hishead.Suddenly, as though stirred by an impulse, the same lad who had justcreated the laugh arose from the bench, and came directly across theroom to where Myles and the bowman sat.""Give thee good-den,"" said he. ""What be\'st thy name and whence comestthou, an I may make bold so to ask?""""My name is Myles Falworth,"" said Myles; ""and I come from Crosbey-Dalebearing a letter to my Lord.""""Never did I hear of Crosbey-Dale,"" said the squire. ""But what seekesthere, if so be I may ask that much?""""I come seeking service,"" said Myles, ""and would enter as an esquiresuch as ye be in my Lord\'s household.""Myles\'s new acquaintance grinned. ""Thou\'lt make a droll squire to waitin a Lord\'s household,"" said he. ""Hast ever been in such service?""""Nay,"" said Myles, ""I have only been at school, and learned Latin andFrench and what not. But Diccon Bowman here hath taught me use of arms.""The young squire laughed outright. ""By\'r Lady, thy talk doth tickleme, friend Myles,"" said he. ""Think\'st thou such matters will gain theefooting here? But stay! Thou didst say anon that thou hadst a letter tomy Lord. From whom is it?""""It is from my father,"" said Myles. ""He is of noble blood, but fallen inestate. He is a kinsman of my Lord\'s, and one time his comrade in arms.""""Sayst so?"" said the other. ""Then mayhap thy chances are not soill, after all."" Then, after a moment, he added: ""My name is FrancisGascoyne, and I will stand thy friend in this matter. Get thy letterready, for my Lord and his Grace of York are within and come forth anon.The Archbishop is on his way to Dalworth, and my Lord escorts him so faras Uppingham. I and those others are to go along. Dost thou know my Lordby sight?""""Nay,"" said Myles, ""I know him not.""""Then I will tell thee when he cometh. Listen!"" said he, as a confusedclattering sounded in the court-yard without. ""Yonder are the horsesnow. They come presently. Busk thee with thy letter, friend Myles.""The attendants who passed through the anteroom now came and went morehurriedly, and Myles knew that the Earl must be about to come forth.He had hardly time to untie his pouch, take out the letter, and tie thestrings again when the arras at the door-way was thrust suddenly aside,and a tall thin squire of about twenty came forth, said some words tothe young men upon the bench, and then withdrew again. Instantly thesquires arose and took their station beside the door-way. A sudden hushfell upon all in the room, and the men-at-arms stood in a line againstthe wall, stiff and erect as though all at once transformed to figuresof iron. Once more the arras was drawn back, and in the hush Myles heardvoices in the other room.""My Lord cometh,"" whispered Gascoyne in his ear, and Myles felt hisheart leap in answer.The next moment two noblemen came into the anteroom followed by a crowdof gentlemen, squires, and pages. One of the two was a dignitary of theChurch; the other Myles instantly singled out as the Earl of Mackworth.']"
82,5,Chapter 5,"['4He was a tall man, taller even than Myles\'s father. He had a thinface, deep-set bushy eyebrows, and a hawk nose. His upper lip was cleanshaven, but from his chin a flowing beard of iron-gray hung nearly tohis waist. He was clad in a riding-gown of black velvet that hung alittle lower than the knee, trimmed with otter fur and embroidered withsilver goshawks--the crest of the family of Beaumont.A light shirt of link mail showed beneath the gown as he walked, and apair of soft undressed leather riding-boots were laced as high as theknee, protecting his scarlet hose from mud and dirt. Over his shouldershe wore a collar of enamelled gold, from which hung a magnificentjewelled pendant, and upon his fist he carried a beautiful Icelandfalcon.As Myles stood staring, he suddenly heard Gascoyne\'s voice whisper inhis ear, ""Yon is my Lord; go forward and give him thy letter.""Scarcely knowing what he did, he walked towards the Earl like a machine,his heart pounding within him and a great humming in his ears. As hedrew near, the nobleman stopped for a moment and stared at him, andMyles, as in a dream, kneeled, and presented the letter. The Earl tookit in his hand, turned it this way and that, looked first at the bearer,then at the packet, and then at the bearer again.""Who art thou?"" said he; ""and what is the matter thou wouldst have ofme?""""I am Myles Falworth,"" said the lad, in a low voice; ""and I come seekingservice with you.""The Earl drew his thick eyebrows quickly together, and shot a keenlook at the lad. ""Falworth?"" said he, sharply--""Falworth? I know noFalworth!""""The letter will tell you,"" said Myles. ""It is from one once dear toyou.""The Earl took the letter, and handing it to a gentleman who stood near,bade him break the seal. ""Thou mayst stand,"" said he to Myles; ""needstnot kneel there forever."" Then, taking the opened parchment again, heglanced first at the face and then at the back, and, seeing its length,looked vexed. Then he read for an earnest moment or two, skipping fromline to line. Presently he folded the letter and thrust it into thepouch at his side. ""So it is, your Grace,"" said he to the lordlyprelate, ""that we who have luck to rise in the world must ever suffer bybeing plagued at all times and seasons. Here is one I chanced to know adozen years ago, who thinks he hath a claim upon me, and saddles mewith his son. I must e\'en take the lad, too, for the sake of peace andquietness."" He glanced around, and seeing Gascoyne, who had drawn near,beckoned to him. ""Take me this fellow,"" said he, ""to the buttery, andsee him fed; and then to Sir James Lee, and have his name entered in thecastle books. And stay, sirrah,"" he added; ""bid me Sir James, if it maybe so done, to enter him as a squire-at-arms. Methinks he will be betterserving so than in the household, for he appeareth a soothly rough cubfor a page.""Myles did look rustic enough, standing clad in frieze in the midst ofthat gay company, and a murmur of laughter sounded around, though hewas too bewildered to fully understand that he was the cause of themerriment. Then some hand drew him back--it was Gascoyne\'s--there was abustle of people passing, and the next minute they were gone, andMyles and old Diccon Bowman and the young squire were left alone in theanteroom.Gascoyne looked very sour and put out. ""Murrain upon it!"" said he; ""hereis good sport spoiled for me to see thee fed. I wish no ill to thee,friend, but I would thou hadst come this afternoon or to-morrow.""""Methinks I bring trouble and dole to every one,"" said Myles, somewhatbitterly. ""It would have been better had I never come to this place,methinks.""His words and tone softened Gascoyne a little. ""Ne\'er mind,"" said thesquire; ""it was not thy fault, and is past mending now. So come and fillthy stomach, in Heaven\'s name.""Perhaps not the least hard part of the whole trying day for Myleswas his parting with Diccon. Gascoyne and he had accompanied the oldretainer to the outer gate, in the archway of which they now stood; forwithout a permit they could go no farther. The old bowman led by thebridle-rein the horse upon which Myles had ridden that morning. His ownnag, a vicious brute, was restive to be gone, but Diccon held him inwith tight rein. He reached down, and took Myles\'s sturdy brown hand inhis crooked, knotted grasp.""Farewell, young master,"" he croaked, tremulously, with a watery glimmerin his pale eyes. ""Thou wilt not forget me when I am gone?""""Nay,"" said Myles; ""I will not forget thee.""""Aye, aye,"" said the old man, looking down at him, and shaking his headslowly from side to side; ""thou art a great tall sturdy fellow now, yethave I held thee on my knee many and many\'s the time, and dandled theewhen thou wert only a little weeny babe. Be still, thou devil\'s limb!""he suddenly broke off, reining back his restive raw-boned steed,which began again to caper and prance. Myles was not sorry for theinterruption; he felt awkward and abashed at the parting, and at the oldman\'s reminiscences, knowing that Gascoyne\'s eyes were resting amusedlyupon the scene, and that the men-at-arms were looking on. Certainlyold Diccon did look droll as he struggled vainly with his vicioushigh-necked nag. ""Nay, a murrain on thee! an\' thou wilt go, go!"" criedhe at last, with a savage dig of his heels into the animal\'s ribs,and away they clattered, the led-horse kicking up its heels as a finalparting, setting Gascoyne fairly alaughing. At the bend of the road theold man turned and nodded his head; the next moment he had disappearedaround the angle of the wall, and it seemed to Myles, as he stoodlooking after him, as though the last thread that bound him to hisold life had snapped and broken. As he turned he saw that Gascoyne waslooking at him.""Dost feel downhearted?"" said the young squire, curiously.""Nay,"" said Myles, brusquely. Nevertheless his throat was tight and dry,and the word came huskily in spite of himself.']"
82,6,Chapter 6,"['5THE EARL of Mackworth, as was customary among the great lords in thosedays, maintained a small army of knights, gentlemen, men-at-arms, andretainers, who were expected to serve him upon all occasions of need,and from whom were supplied his quota of recruits to fill such levies asmight be made upon him by the King in time of war.The knights and gentlemen of this little army of horse and foot soldierswere largely recruited from the company of squires and bachelors, as theyoung novitiate soldiers of the castle were called.This company of esquires consisted of from eighty to ninety lads,ranging in age from eight to twenty years. Those under fourteen yearswere termed pages, and served chiefly the Countess and her waitinggentlewomen, in whose company they acquired the graces and polish of thetimes, such as they were. After reaching the age of fourteen the ladswere entitled to the name of esquire or squire.In most of the great houses of the time the esquires were the especialattendants upon the Lord and Lady of the house, holding such positionsas body-squires, cup-bearers, carvers, and sometimes the office ofchamberlain. But Devlen, like some other of the princely castles of thegreatest nobles, was more like a military post or a fortress than anordinary household. Only comparatively few of the esquires could beused in personal attendance upon the Earl; the others were trainedmore strictly in arms, and served rather in the capacity of a sort ofbody-guard than as ordinary squires. For, as the Earl rose in power andinfluence, and as it so became well worth while for the lower nobilityand gentry to enter their sons in his family, the body of squires becamealmost cumbersomely large. Accordingly, that part which comprised thesquires proper, as separate from the younger pages, was divided intothree classes--first, squires of the body, who were those just pastpagehood, and who waited upon the Earl in personal service; second,squires of the household, who, having regular hours assigned forexercise in the manual of arms, were relieved from personal serviceexcepting upon especial occasions; and thirdly and lastly, at the headof the whole body of lads, a class called bachelors--young men rangingfrom eighteen to twenty years of age. This class was supposed toexercise a sort of government over the other and younger squires--tokeep them in order as much as possible, to marshal them upon occasionsof importance, to see that their arms and equipments were kept in goodorder, to call the roll for chapel in the morning, and to see that thosenot upon duty in the house were present at the daily exercise at arms.Orders to the squires were generally transmitted through the bachelors,and the head of that body was expected to make weekly reports of affairsin their quarters to the chief captain of the body.From this overlordship of the bachelors there had gradually risen asystem of fagging, such as is or was practised in the great Englishpublic schools--enforced services exacted from the younger lads--whichat the time Myles came to Devlen had, in the five or six years it hadbeen in practice, grown to be an absolute though unwritten law of thebody--a law supported by all the prestige of long-continued usage. Atthat time the bachelors numbered but thirteen, yet they exercised overthe rest of the sixty-four squires and pages a rule of iron, and weretaskmasters, hard, exacting, and oftentimes cruel.The whole company of squires and pages was under the supreme command ofa certain one-eyed knight, by name Sir James Lee; a soldier seasoned bythe fire of a dozen battles, bearing a score of wounds won in fight andtourney, and withered by hardship and labor to a leather-like toughness.He had fought upon the King\'s side in all the late wars, and had atShrewsbury received a wound that unfitted him for active service, sothat now he was fallen to the post of Captain of Esquires at DevlenCastle--a man disappointed in life, and with a temper imbittered by thatfailure as well as by cankering pain.Yet Perhaps no one could have been better fitted for the place he heldthan Sir James Lee. The lads under his charge were a rude, rough, unrulyset, quick, like their elders, to quarrel, and to quarrel fiercely, evento the drawing of sword or dagger. But there was a cold, iron sternnessabout the grim old man that quelled them, as the trainer with a lash ofsteel might quell a den of young wolves. The apartments in which he waslodged, with his clerk, were next in the dormitory of the lads, andeven in the midst of the most excited brawlings the distant sound of hisharsh voice, ""Silence, messieurs!"" would bring an instant hush to theloudest uproar.It was into his grim presence that Myles was introduced by Gascoyne.Sir James was in his office, a room bare of ornament or adornment orsuperfluous comfort of any sort--without even so much as a mat of rushesupon the cold stone pavement to make it less cheerless. The old one-eyedknight sat gnawing his bristling mustaches. To anyone who knew him itwould have been apparent that, as the castle phrase went, ""the devil satastride of his neck,"" which meant that some one of his blind wounds wasaching more sorely than usual.His clerk sat beside him, with account-books and parchment spread uponthe table, and the head squire, Walter Blunt, a lad some three or fouryears older than Myles, and half a head taller, black-browed, powerfullybuilt, and with cheek and chin darkened by the soft budding of hisadolescent beard, stood making his report.Sir James listened in grim silence while Gascoyne told his errand.""So, then, pardee, I am bid to take another one of ye, am I?"" hesnarled. ""As though ye caused me not trouble enow; and this one a cub,looking a very boor in carriage and breeding. Mayhap the Earl thinketh Iam to train boys to his dilly-dally household service as well as to useof arms.""""Sir,"" said Gascoyne, timidly, ""my Lord sayeth he would have this oneentered direct as a squire of the body, so that he need not serve in thehousehold.""""Sayest so?"" cried Sir James, harshly. ""Then take thou my message backagain to thy Lord. Not for Mackworth--no, nor a better man than he--willI make any changes in my government. An I be set to rule a pack of boys,I will rule them as I list, and not according to any man\'s bidding.Tell him, sirrah, that I will enter no lad as squire of the body withoutfirst testing an he be fit at arms to hold that place."" He sat for awhile glowering at Myles and gnawing his mustaches, and for the timeno one dared to break the grim silence. ""What is thy name?"" said he,suddenly. And then, almost before Myles could answer, he asked the headsquire whether he could find a place to lodge him.""There is Gillis Whitlock\'s cot empty,"" said Blunt. ""He is in theinfirmary, and belike goeth home again when he cometh thence. The feverhath gotten into his bones, and--""""That will do,"" said the knight, interrupting him impatiently. ""Let himtake that place, or any other that thou hast. And thou, Jerome,"" said heto his clerk, ""thou mayst enter him upon the roll, though whether it beas page or squire or bachelor shall be as I please, and not as Mackworthbiddeth me. Now get ye gone.""""Old Bruin\'s wound smarteth him sore,"" Gascoyne observed, as the twolads walked across the armory court. He had good-naturedly offered toshow the new-comer the many sights of interest around the castle, and inthe hour or so of ramble that followed, the two grew from acquaintancesto friends with a quickness that boyhood alone can bring about. Theyvisited the armory, the chapel, the stables, the great hall, the PaintedChamber, the guard-house, the mess-room, and even the scullery and thekitchen, with its great range of boilers and furnaces and ovens. Last ofall Myles\'s new friend introduced him to the armor-smithy.""My Lord hath sent a piece of Milan armor thither to be repaired,"" saidhe. ""Belike thou would like to see it.""""Aye,"" said Myles, eagerly, ""that would I.""The smith was a gruff, good-natured fellow, and showed the piece ofarmor to Myles readily and willingly enough. It was a beautiful bascinetof inlaid workmanship, and was edged with a rim of gold. Myles scarcelydared touch it; he gazed at it with an unconcealed delight that warmedthe smith\'s honest heart.""I have another piece of Milan here,"" said he. ""Did I ever show thee mydagger, Master Gascoyne?""""Nay,"" said the squire.The smith unlocked a great oaken chest in the corner of the shop, liftedthe lid, and brought thence a beautiful dagger with the handle of ebonyand silver-gilt, and a sheath of Spanish leather, embossed and gilt.The keen, well-tempered blade was beautifully engraved and inlaidwith niello-work, representing a group of figures in a then popularsubject--the dance of Death. It was a weapon at once unique andbeautiful, and even Gascoyne showed an admiration scarcely less keenthan Myles\'s openly-expressed delight.""To whom doth it belong?"" said he, trying the point upon his thumb nail.""There,"" said the smith, ""is the jest of the whole, for it belongethto me. Sir William Beauclerk bade me order the weapon through MasterGildersworthy, of London town, and by the time it came hither, lo! hehad died, and so it fell to my hands. No one here payeth the price forthe trinket, and so I must e\'en keep it myself, though I be but a poorman.""""How much dost thou hold it for?"" said Gascoyne.""Seventeen shillings buyeth it,"" said the armorer, carelessly.""Aye, aye,"" said Gascoyne, with a sigh; ""so it is to be poor, and not beable to have such things as one loveth and would fain possess. Seventeenshillings is nigh as much by half again as all my yearly wage.""Then a sudden thought came to Myles, and as it came his cheeks glowedas hot as fire ""Master Gascoyne,"" said he, with gruff awkwardness,""thou hast been a very good, true friend to me since I have come to thisplace, and hast befriended me in all ways thou mightest do, and I, aswell I know, but a poor rustic clod. Now I have forty shillings by mewhich I may spend as I list, and so I do beseech thee that thou wilttake yon dagger of me as a love-gift, and have and hold it for thy veryown.""Gascoyne stared open-mouthed at Myles. ""Dost mean it?"" said he, at last.""Aye,"" said Myles, ""I do mean it. Master Smith, give him the blade.""At first the smith grinned, thinking it all a jest; but he soon saw thatMyles was serious enough, and when the seventeen shillings were producedand counted down upon the anvil, he took off his cap and made Myles alow bow as he swept them into his pouch. ""Now, by my faith and troth,""quoth he, ""that I do call a true lordly gift. Is it not so, MasterGascoyne?""""Aye,"" said Gascoyne, with a gulp, ""it is, in soothly earnest."" Andthereupon, to Myles\'s great wonderment, he suddenly flung his arms abouthis neck, and, giving him a great hug, kissed him upon the cheek. ""DearMyles,"" said he, ""I tell thee truly and of a verity I did feel warmtowards thee from the very first time I saw thee sitting like a poor oafupon the bench up yonder in the anteroom, and now of a sooth I give theeassurance that I do love thee as my own brother. Yea, I will take thedagger, and will stand by thee as a true friend from this time forth.Mayhap thou mayst need a true friend in this place ere thou livest longwith us, for some of us esquires be soothly rough, and knocks are moreplenty here than broad pennies, so that one new come is like to have ahard time gaining a footing.""""I thank thee,"" said Myles, ""for thy offer of love and friendship, anddo tell thee, upon my part, that I also of all the world would like bestto have thee for my friend.""Such was the manner In which Myles formed the first great friendship ofhis life, a friendship that was destined to last him through many yearsto come. As the two walked back across the great quadrangle, upon whichfronted the main buildings of the castle, their arms were wound acrossone another\'s shoulders, after the manner, as a certain great writersays, of boys and lovers.']"
82,7,Chapter 7,"['6A boy\'s life is of a very flexible sort. It takes but a little while forit to shape itself to any new surroundings in which it may be thrown, tomake itself new friends, to settle itself to new habits; and so it wasthat Myles fell directly into the ways of the lads of Devlen. On hisfirst morning, as he washed his face and hands with the other squiresand pages in a great tank of water in the armory court-yard, hepresently found himself splashing and dashing with the others, laughingand shouting as loud as any, and calling some by their Christian namesas though he had known them for years instead of overnight. Duringchapel he watched with sympathetic delight the covert pranks of theyoungsters during the half-hour that Father Emmanuel droned his Latin,and with his dagger point he carved his own name among the many cutdeep into the back of the bench before him. When, after breakfast, thesquires poured like school-boys into the great armory to answer to theroll-call for daily exercise, he came storming in with the rest, beatingthe lad in front of him with his cap.Boys are very keen to feel the influence of a forceful character. A ladwith a strong will is quick to reach his proper level as a greater orlesser leader among the others, and Myles was of just the masterfulnature to make his individuality felt among the Devlen squires. He wasquick enough to yield obedience upon all occasions to proper authority,but would never bend an inch to the usurpation of tyranny. In the schoolat St. Mary\'s Priory at Crosbey-Dale he would submit without a murmur oroffer of resistance to chastisement by old Father Ambrose, theregular teacher; but once, when the fat old monk was sick, and a greatlong-legged strapping young friar, who had temporarily taken his place,undertook to administer punishment, Myles, with a wrestling trip, flunghim sprawling backward over a bench into the midst of a shoal of smallboys amid a hubbub of riotous confusion. He had been flogged soundlyfor it under the supervision of Prior Edward himself; but so soon ashis punishment was over, he assured the prior very seriously that shouldlike occasion again happen he would act in the same manner, flogging orno flogging.It was this bold, outspoken spirit that gained him at once friends andenemies at Devlen, and though it first showed itself in what was but alittle matter, nevertheless it set a mark upon him that singled him outfrom the rest, and, although he did not suspect it at the time, calledto him the attention of Sir James Lee himself, who regarded him as a ladof free and frank spirit.The first morning after the roll-call in the armory, as Walter Blunt,the head bachelor, rolled up the slip of parchment, and the temporarysilence burst forth into redoubled noise and confusion, each lad arminghimself from a row of racks that stood along the wall, he beckoned Mylesto him.""My Lord himself hath spoken to Sir James Lee concerning thee,"" said he.""Sir James maintaineth that he will not enter thee into the body tillthou hast first practised for a while at the pels, and shown what thoucanst do at broadsword. Hast ever fought at the pel?""""Aye,"" answered Myles, ""and that every day of my life sin I becameesquire four years ago, saving only Sundays and holy days.""""With shield and broadsword?""""Sometimes,"" said Myles, ""and sometimes with the short sword.""""Sir James would have thee come to the tilt-yard this morn; he himselfwill take thee in hand to try what thou canst do. Thou mayst take thearms upon yonder rack, and use them until otherwise bidden. Thou seestthat the number painted above it on the wall is seventeen; that will bethy number for the nonce.""So Myles armed himself from his rack as the others were doing fromtheirs. The armor was rude and heavy, used to accustom the body to theweight of the iron plates rather than for any defence. It consisted ofa cuirass, or breastplate of iron, opening at the side with hinges, andcatching with hooks and eyes; epauliers, or shoulder-plates; arm-platesand leg-pieces; and a bascinet, or open-faced helmet. A great triangularshield covered with leather and studded with bosses of iron, and a heavybroadsword, pointed and dulled at the edges, completed the equipment.The practice at the pels which Myles was bidden to attend comprised thechief exercise of the day with the esquires of young cadet soldiers ofthat time, and in it they learned not only all the strokes, cuts, andthrusts of sword-play then in vogue, but also toughness, endurance, andelastic quickness. The pels themselves consisted of upright posts ofash or oak, about five feet six inches in height, and in girth somewhatthicker than a man\'s thigh. They were firmly planted in the ground, andupon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed.At Devlen the pels stood just back of the open and covered tiltingcourts and the archery ranges, and thither those lads not upon householdduty were marched every morning excepting Fridays and Sundays, and werethere exercised under the direction of Sir James Lee and two assistants.The whole company was divided into two, sometimes into three parties,each of which took its turn at the exercise, delivering at the wordof command the various strokes, feints, attacks, and retreats as theinstructors ordered.After five minutes of this mock battle the perspiration began to pourdown the faces, and the breath to come thick and short; but it was notuntil the lads could absolutely endure no more that the order was givento rest, and they were allowed to fling themselves panting upon theground, while another company took its place at the triple row of posts.As Myles struck and hacked at the pel assigned to him, Sir James Leestood beside him watching him in grim silence. The lad did his best toshow the knight all that he knew of upper cut, under cut, thrust, andback-hand stroke, but it did not seem to him that Sir James was verywell satisfied with his skill.""Thou fightest like a clodpole,"" said the old man. ""Ha, that strokewas but ill-recovered. Strike me it again, and get thou in guard morequickly.""Myles repeated the stroke.""Pest!"" cried Sir James. ""Thou art too slow by a week. Here, strike thouthe blow at me.""Myles hesitated. Sir James held a stout staff in his hand, but otherwisehe was unarmed.""Strike, I say!"" said Sir James. ""What stayest thou for? Art afeard?""It was Myles\'s answer that set the seal of individuality upon him.""Nay,"" said he, boldly, ""I am not afeard. I fear not thee nor any man!""So saying, he delivered the stroke at Sir James with might and main. Itwas met with a jarring blow that made his wrist and arm tingle, and thenext instant he received a stroke upon the bascinet that caused his earsto ring and the sparks to dance and fly before his eyes.""Pardee!"" said Sir James, grimly. ""An I had had a mace in my hand, Iwould have knocked thy cockerel brains out that time. Thou mayst takethat blow for answering me so pertly. And now we are quits. Now strikeme the stroke again an thou art not afeard.""Myles\'s eyes watered in spite of himself, and he shut the lids tight towink the dimness away. Nevertheless he spoke up undauntedly as before.""Aye, marry, will I strike it again,"" said he; and this time he wasable to recover guard quickly enough to turn Sir James\'s blow with hisshield, instead of receiving it upon his head.""So!"" said Sir James. ""Now mind thee of this, that when thou strikestthat lower cut at the legs, recover thyself more quickly. Now, then,strike me it at the pel.""Gascoyne and other of the lads who were just then lying stretched outupon the grass beneath, a tree at the edge of the open court where stoodthe pels, were interested spectators of the whole scene. Not one of themin their memory had heard Sir James so answered face to face as Myleshad answered him, and, after all, perhaps the lad himself would nothave done so had he been longer a resident in the squires\' quarters atDevlen.""By \'r Lady! thou art a cool blade, Myles,"" said Gascoyne, as theymarched back to the armory again. ""Never heard I one bespeak Sir Jamesas thou hast done this day.""""And, after all,"" said another of the young squires, ""old Bruin was notso ill-pleased, methinks. That was a shrewd blow he fetched thee on thecrown, Falworth. Marry, I would not have had it on my own skull for asilver penny.""']"
82,8,Chapter 8,"['7So little does it take to make a body\'s reputation.That night all the squires\' quarters buzzed with the story of how thenew boy, Falworth, had answered Sir James Lee to his face without fear,and had exchanged blows with him hand to hand. Walter Blunt himself wasmoved to some show of interest.""What said he to thee, Falworth?"" asked he.""He said naught,"" said Myles, brusquely. ""He only sought to show me howto recover from the under cut.""""It is passing strange that he should take so much notice of thee as toexchange blows with thee with his own hand. Haply thou art either veryquick or parlous slow at arms.""""It is quick that he is,"" said Gascoyne, speaking up in his friend\'sbehalf. ""For the second time that Falworth delivered the stroke, SirJames could not reach him to return; so I saw with mine own eyes.""But that very sterling independence that had brought Myles so creditablythrough this adventure was certain to embroil him with the rude,half-savage lads about him, some of whom, especially among thebachelors, were his superiors as well in age as in skill and training.As said before, the bachelors had enforced from the younger boys afagging sort of attendance on their various personal needs, and it wasupon this point that Myles first came to grief. As it chanced, severaldays passed before any demand was made upon him for service to the headsof the squirehood, but when that demand was made, the bachelors werevery quick to see that the boy who was bold enough to speak up to SirJames Lee was not likely to be a willing fag for them.""I tell thee, Francis,"" he said, as Gascoyne and he talked over thematter one day--""I tell thee I will never serve them. Prithee, whatshame can be fouler than to do such menial service, saving for one\'srightful Lord?""""Marry!"" quoth Gascoyne; ""I reason not of shame at this or that. All Iknow is that others serve them who are haply as good and maybe betterthan I be, and that if I do not serve them I get knocked i\' th\' headtherefore, which same goeth soothly against my stomach.""""I judge not for thee,"" said Myles. ""Thou art used to these castleways, but only I know that I will not serve them, though they be thirtyagainst me instead of thirteen.""""Then thou art a fool,"" said Gascoyne, dryly.Now in this matter of service there was one thing above all others thatstirred Myles Falworth\'s ill-liking. The winter before he had come toDevlen, Walter Blunt, who was somewhat of a Sybarite in his way, and whohad a repugnance to bathing in the general tank in the open armory courtin frosty weather, had had Dick Carpenter build a trough in the cornerof the dormitory for the use of the bachelors, and every morning it wasthe duty of two of the younger squires to bring three pails of water tofill this private tank for the use of the head esquires. It was seeingtwo of his fellow-esquires fetching and carrying this water that Mylesdisliked so heartily, and every morning his bile was stirred anew at thesight.""Sooner would I die than yield to such vile service,"" said he.He did not know how soon his protestations would be put to the test.One night--it was a week or two after Myles had come to Devlen--Bluntwas called to attend the Earl at livery. The livery was the last meal ofthe day, and was served with great pomp and ceremony about nine o\'clockat night to the head of the house as he lay in bed. Curfew had not yetrung, and the lads in the squires\' quarters were still wrestling andsparring and romping boisterously in and out around the long row of rudecots in the great dormitory as they made ready for the night. Six oreight flaring links in wrought-iron brackets that stood out from thewall threw a great ruddy glare through the barrack-like room--a light ofall others to romp by. Myles and Gascoyne were engaged in defending thepassage-way between their two cots against the attack of three otherlads, and Myles held his sheepskin coverlet rolled up into a ball andbalanced in his hand, ready for launching at the head of one of theothers so soon as it should rise from behind the shelter of a cot. Justthen Walter Blunt, dressed with more than usual care, passed by on hisway to the Earl\'s house. He stopped for a moment and said, ""Mayhaps Iwill not be in until late to-night. Thou and Falworth, Gascoyne, mayfetch water to-morrow.""Then he was gone. Myles stood staring after his retreating figure witheyes open and mouth agape, still holding the ball of sheepskin balancedin his hand. Gascoyne burst into a helpless laugh at his blank,stupefied face, but the next moment he laid his hand on his friend\'sshoulder.""Myles,"" he said, ""thou wilt not make trouble, wilt thou?""Myles made no answer. He flung down his sheepskin and sat him gloomilydown upon the side of the cot.""I said that I would sooner die than fetch water for them,"" said he.""Aye, aye,"" said Gascoyne; ""but that was spoken in haste.""Myles said nothing, but shook his head.But, after all, circumstances shape themselves. The next morning when herose up through the dark waters of sleep it was to feel some one shakinghim violently by the shoulder.""Come!"" cried Gascoyne, as Myles opened his eyes--""come, time passeth,and we are late.""Myles, bewildered with his sudden awakening, and still fuddled with thefumes of sleep, huddled into his doublet and hose, hardly knowing whathe was doing; tying a point here and a point there, and slippinghis feet into his shoes. Then he hurried after Gascoyne, frowzy,half-dressed, and even yet only half-awake. It was not until he wasfairly out into the fresh air and saw Gascoyne filling the threeleathern buckets at the tank, that he fully awakened to the fact that hewas actually doing that hateful service for the bachelors which he hadprotested he would sooner die than render.The sun was just rising, gilding the crown of the donjon-keep with aflame of ruddy light. Below, among the lesser buildings, the day wasstill gray and misty. Only an occasional noise broke the silence of theearly morning: a cough from one of the rooms; the rattle of a pot ora pan, stirred by some sleepy scullion; the clapping of a door or ashutter, and now and then the crowing of a cock back of the long row ofstables--all sounding loud and startling in the fresh dewy stillness.""Thou hast betrayed me,"" said Myles, harshly, breaking the silence atlast. ""I knew not what I was doing, or else I would never have comehither. Ne\'theless, even though I be come, I will not carry the waterfor them.""""So be it,"" said Gascoyne, tartly. ""An thou canst not stomach it,let be, and I will e\'en carry all three myself. It will make me twojourneys, but, thank Heaven, I am not so proud as to wish to get mehard knocks for naught."" So saying, he picked up two of the buckets andstarted away across the court for the dormitory.Then Myles, with a lowering face, snatched up the third, and, hurryingafter, gave him his hand with the extra pail. So it was that he came todo service, after all.""Why tarried ye so long?"" said one of the older bachelors, roughly, asthe two lads emptied the water into the wooden trough. He sat on theedge of the cot, blowzed and untrussed, with his long hair tumbled anddisordered.His dictatorial tone stung Myles to fury. ""We tarried no longer thanneed be,"" answered he, savagely. ""Have we wings to fly withal at yourbidding?""He spoke so loudly that all in the room heard him; the younger squireswho were dressing stared in blank amazement, and Blunt sat up suddenlyin his cot.""Why, how now?"" he cried. ""Answerest thou back thy betters so pertly,sirrah? By my soul, I have a mind to crack thy head with this clog forthy unruly talk.""He glared at Myles as he spoke, and Myles glared back again with rightgood-will. Matters might have come to a crisis, only that Gascoyne andWilkes dragged their friend away before he had opportunity to answer.""An ill-conditioned knave as ever I did see,"" growled Blunt, glaringafter him.""Myles, Myles,"" said Gascoyne, almost despairingly, ""why wilt thoubreed such mischief for thyself? Seest thou not thou hast got theethe ill-will of every one of the bachelors, from Wat Blunt to Robin deRamsey?""""I care not,"" said Myles, fiercely, recurring to his grievance. ""Heardye not how the dogs upbraided me before the whole room? That Bluntcalled me an ill-conditioned knave.""""Marry!"" said Gascoyne, laughing, ""and so thou art.""Thus it is that boldness may breed one enemies as well as gain onefriends. My own notion is that one\'s enemies are more quick to act thanone\'s friends.']"
82,9,Chapter 9,"['8Every one knows the disagreeable, lurking discomfort that follows aquarrel--a discomfort that imbitters the very taste of life for the timebeing. Such was the dull distaste that Myles felt that morning afterwhat had passed in the dormitory. Every one in the proximity of suchan open quarrel feels a reflected constraint, and in Myles\'s mind was adisagreeable doubt whether that constraint meant disapproval of him orof his late enemies.It seemed to him that Gascoyne added the last bitter twang to hisunpleasant feelings when, half an hour later, they marched with theothers to chapel.""Why dost thou breed such trouble for thyself, Myles?"" said he,recurring to what he had already said. ""Is it not foolish for thee tocome hither to this place, and then not submit to the ways thereof, asthe rest of us do?""""Thou talkest not like a true friend to chide me thus,"" said Myles,sullenly; and he withdrew his arm from his friend\'s.""Marry, come up!"" said Gascoyne; ""an I were not thy friend, I would letthee jog thine own way. It aches not my bones to have thine drubbed.""Just then they entered the chapel, and words that might have led to aquarrel were brought to a close.Myles was not slow to see that he had the ill will of the head of theircompany. That morning in the armory he had occasion to ask some questionof Blunt; the head squire stared coldly at him for a moment, gave him ashort, gruff answer, and then, turning his back abruptly, began talkingwith one of the other bachelors. Myles flushed hot at the other\'sinsulting manner, and looked quickly around to see if any of the othershad observed what had passed. It was a comfort to him to see that allwere too busy arming themselves to think of anything else; nevertheless,his face was very lowering as he turned away.""Some day I will show him that I am as good a man as he,"" he muttered tohimself. ""An evil-hearted dog to put shame upon me!""The storm was brewing and ready to break.That day was exceptionally hot and close, and permission had been askedby and granted to those squires not on duty to go down to the river fora bath after exercise at the pels. But as Myles replaced his arms inthe rack, a little page came with a bidding to come to Sir James in hisoffice.""Look now,"" said Myles, ""here is just my ill-fortune. Why might he nothave waited an hour longer rather than cause me to miss going with ye?""""Nay,"" said Gascoyne, ""let not that grieve thee, Myles. Wilkes and Iwill wait for thee in the dormitory--will we not, Edmund? Make thouhaste and go to Sir James.""Sir James was sitting at the table studying over a scroll of parchment,when Myles entered his office and stood before him at the table.""Well, boy,"" said he, laying aside the parchment and looking up at thelad, ""I have tried thee fairly for these few days, and may say that Ihave found thee worthy to be entered upon the rolls as esquire of thebody.""""I give thee thanks, sir,"" said Myles.The knight nodded his head in acknowledgement, but did not at once givethe word of dismissal that Myles had expected. ""Dost mean to write theea letter home soon?"" said he, suddenly.""Aye,"" said Myles, gaping in great wonderment at the strangeness of thequestion.""Then when thou dost so write,"" said Sir James, ""give thou my deepregards to thy father."" Then he continued, after a brief pause. ""Him didI know well in times gone by, and we were right true friends in heartylove, and for his sake I would befriend thee--that is, in so much as isfitting.""""Sir,"" said Myles; but Sir James held up his hand, and he stopped shortin his thanks.""But, boy,"" said he, ""that which I sent for thee for to tell thee was ofmore import than these. Dost thou know that thy father is an attaintedoutlaw?""""Nay,"" cried Myles, his cheeks blazing up as red as fire; ""who sayeththat of him lieth in his teeth.""""Thou dost mistake me,"" said Sir James, quietly. ""It is sometimes noshame to be outlawed and banned. Had it been so, I would not have toldthee thereof, nor have bidden thee send my true love to thy father, asI did but now. But, boy, certes he standest continually in greatdanger--greater than thou wottest of. Were it known where he lieth hid,it might be to his undoing and utter ruin. Methought that belike thoumightest not know that; and so I sent for thee for to tell thee that itbehoovest thee to say not one single word concerning him to any of thesenew friends of thine, nor who he is, nor what he is.""""But how came my father to be so banned?"" said Myles, in a constrainedand husky voice, and after a long time of silence.""That I may not tell thee just now,"" said the old knight, ""onlythis--that I have been bidden to make it known to thee that thy fatherhath an enemy full as powerful as my Lord the Earl himself, andthat through that enemy all his ill-fortune--his blindness andeverything--hath come. Moreover, did this enemy know where thy fatherlieth, he would slay him right speedily.""""Sir,"" cried Myles, violently smiting his open palm upon the table,""tell me who this man is, and I will kill him!""Sir James smiled grimly. ""Thou talkest like a boy,"" said he. ""Wait untilthou art grown to be a man. Mayhap then thou mayst repent thee of thesebold words, for one time this enemy of thy father\'s was reckoned theforemost knight in England, and he is now the King\'s dear friend and agreat lord.""""But,"" said Myles, after another long time of heavy silence, ""will notmy Lord then befriend me for the sake of my father, who was one time hisdear comrade?""Sir James shook his head. ""It may not be,"" said he. ""Neither thou northy father must look for open favor from the Earl. An he befriendedFalworth, and it came to be known that he had given him aid or succor,it might belike be to his own undoing. No, boy; thou must not even lookto be taken into the household to serve with gentlemen as the othersquires do serve, but must even live thine own life here and fight thineown way.""Myles\'s eyes blazed. ""Then,"" cried he, fiercely, ""it is shame andattaint upon my Lord the Earl, and cowardice as well, and never will Iask favor of him who is so untrue a friend as to turn his back upon acomrade in trouble as he turneth his back upon my father.""""Thou art a foolish boy,"" said Sir James with a bitter smile, ""andknowest naught of the world. An thou wouldst look for man to befriendman to his own danger, thou must look elsewhere than on this earth. WasI not one time Mackworth\'s dear friend as well as thy father? It couldcost him naught to honor me, and here am I fallen to be a teacher ofboys. Go to! thou art a fool.""Then, after a little pause of brooding silence, he went on to say thatthe Earl was no better or worse than the rest of the world. That men ofhis position had many jealous enemies, ever seeking their ruin, andthat such must look first of all each to himself, or else be certainlyruined, and drag down others in that ruin. Myles was silenced, but thebitterness had entered his heart, and abided with him for many a dayafterwards.Perhaps Sir James read his feelings in his frank face, for he satlooking curiously at him, twirling his grizzled mustache the while.""Thou art like to have hard knocks of it, lad, ere thou hast gotten theesafe through the world,"" said he, with more kindness in his harsh voicethan was usual. ""But get thee not into fights before thy time."" Then hecharged the boy very seriously to live at peace with his fellow-squires,and for his father\'s sake as well as his own to enter into none of thebroils that were so frequent in their quarters.It was with this special admonition against brawling that Myles wasdismissed, to enter, before five minutes had passed, into the firstreally great fight of his life.Besides Gascoyne and Wilkes, he found gathered in the dormitory sixor eight of the company of squires who were to serve that day uponhousehold duty; among others, Walter Blunt and three other bachelors,who were changing their coarse service clothes for others more fit forthe household.""Why didst thou tarry so long, Myles?"" said Gascoyne, as he entered.""Methought thou wert never coming.""""Where goest thou, Falworth?"" called Blunt from the other end of theroom, where he was lacing his doublet.Just now Myles had no heart in the swimming or sport of any sort, but heanswered, shortly, ""I go to the river to swim.""""Nay,"" said Blunt, ""thou goest not forth from the castle to-day. Hastthou forgot how thou didst answer me back about fetching the waterthis morning? This day thou must do penance, so go thou straight to thearmory and scour thou up my breastplate.""From the time he had arisen that morning everything had gone wrong withMyles. He had felt himself already outrated in rendering service tothe bachelors, he had quarrelled with the head of the esquires, he hadnearly quarrelled with Gascoyne, and then had come the bitterest andworst of all, the knowledge that his father was an outlaw, and thatthe Earl would not stretch out a hand to aid him or to give him anycountenance. Blunt\'s words brought the last bitter cut to his heart,and they stung him to fury. For a while he could not answer, but stoodglaring with a face fairly convulsed with passion at the young man, whocontinued his toilet, unconscious of the wrath of the new recruit.Gascoyne and Wilkes, accepting Myles\'s punishment as a thing of course,were about to leave the dormitory when Myles checked them.""Stop, Francis!"" he cried, hoarsely. ""Thinkest thou that I will staybehind to do yon dog\'s dirty work? No; I go with ye.""A moment or two of dumb, silent amazement followed his bold words; thenBlunt cried, ""Art thou mad?""""Nay,"" answered Myles in the same hoarse voice, ""I am not mad. I tellthee a better man than thou shouldst not stay me from going an I list togo.""I will break thy cockerel head for that speech,"" said Blunt, furiously.He stooped as he spoke, and picked up a heavy clog that lay at his feet.It was no insignificant weapon either. The shoes of those days weresometimes made of cloth, and had long pointed toes stuffed with tow orwool. In muddy weather thick heavy clogs or wooden soles were strapped,like a skate, to the bottom of the foot. That clog which Blunt hadseized was perhaps eighteen or twenty inches long, two or two and a halfinches thick at the heel, tapering to a point at the toe. As the olderlad advanced, Gascoyne stepped between him and his victim.""Do not harm him, Blunt,"" he pleaded. ""Bear thou in mind how new-come heis among us. He knoweth not our ways as yet.""""Stand thou back, Gascoyne,"" said Blunt, harshly, as he thrust himaside. ""I will teach him our ways so that he will not soon forget them.""Close to Myles\'s feet was another clog like that one which Blunt held.He snatched it up, and set his back against the wall, with a white faceand a heart beating heavily and tumultuously, but with courage steeledto meet the coming encounter. There was a hard, grim look in his blueeyes that, for a moment perhaps, quelled the elder lad. He hesitated.""Tom! Wat! Ned!"" he called to the other bachelors, ""come hither, andlend me a hand with this knave.""""An ye come nigh me,"" panted Myles, ""I will brain the first withinreach.""Then Gascoyne dodged behind the others, and, without being seen, slippedout of the room for help.The battle that followed was quick, sharp, and short. As Blunt strodeforward, Myles struck, and struck with might and main, but he was tooexcited to deliver his blow with calculation. Blunt parried it with theclog he held, and the next instant, dropping his weapon, gripped Mylestight about the body, pinning his arms to his sides.Myles also dropped the clog he held, and, wrenching out his rightarm with a sudden heave, struck Blunt full in the face, and then withanother blow sent him staggering back. It all passed in an instant; thenext the three other bachelors were upon him, catching him by the body,the arms, the legs. For a moment or two they swayed and stumbled hitherand thither, and then down they fell in a struggling heap.Myles fought like a wild-cat, kicking, struggling, scratching; strikingwith elbows and fists. He caught one of the three by his collar, andtore his jacket open from the neck to the waist; he drove his foot intothe pit of the stomach of another, and knocked him breathless. The otherlads not in the fight stood upon the benches and the beds around, butsuch was the awe inspired by the prestige of the bachelors that not oneof them dared to lend hand to help him, and so Myles fought his fiercebattle alone.But four to one were odds too great, and though Myles struggled asfiercely as ever, by-and-by it was with less and less resistance.Blunt had picked up the clog he had dropped when he first attacked thelad, and now stood over the struggling heap, white with rage, the bloodrunning from his lip, cut and puffed where Myles had struck him, andmurder looking out from his face, if ever it looked out of the face ofany mortal being.""Hold him a little,"" said he, fiercely, ""and I will still him for you.""Even yet it was no easy matter for the others to do his bidding, butpresently he got his chance and struck a heavy, cruel blow at Myles\'shead. Myles only partly warded it with his arm. Hitherto he had foughtin silence, now he gave a harsh cry.""Holy Saints!"" cried Edmund Wilkes. ""They will kill him.""Blunt struck two more blows, both of them upon the body, and then atlast they had the poor boy down, with his face upon the ground and hisarms pinned to his sides, and Blunt, bracing himself for the stroke,with a grin of rage raised a heavy clog for one terrible blow thatshould finish the fight.']"
82,10,Chapter 10,"['9""How now, messieurs?"" said a harsh voice, that fell upon the turmoillike a thunder-clap, and there stood Sir James Lee. Instantly thestruggle ceased, and the combatants scrambled to their feet.The older lads stood silent before their chief, but Myles was deaf andblind and mad with passion, he knew not where he stood or what he saidor did. White as death, he stood for a while glaring about him, catchinghis breath convulsively. Then he screamed hoarsely.""Who struck me? Who struck me when I was down? I will have his bloodthat struck me!"" He caught sight of Blunt. ""It was he that struck me!""he cried. ""Thou foul traitor! thou coward!"" and thereupon leaped at hisenemy like a wild-cat.""Stop!"" cried Sir James Lee, clutching him by the arm.Myles was too blinded by his fury to see who it was that held him. ""Iwill not stop!"" he cried, struggling and striking at the knight. ""Let mego! I will have his life that struck me when I was down!""The next moment he found himself pinned close against the wall, andthen, as though his sight came back, he saw the grim face of the oldone-eyed knight looking into his.""Dost thou know who I am?"" said a stern, harsh voice.Instantly Myles ceased struggling, and his arms fell at his side. ""Aye,""he said, in a gasping voice, ""I know thee."" He swallowed spasmodicallyfor a moment or two, and then, in the sudden revulsion of feeling, burstout sobbing convulsively.Sir James marched the two off to his office, he himself walkingbetween them, holding an arm of each, the other lads following behind,awe-struck and silent. Entering the office, Sir James shut the doorbehind him, leaving the group of squires clustered outside about thestone steps, speculating in whispers as to what would be the outcome ofthe matter.After Sir James had seated himself, the two standing facing him, heregarded them for a while in silence. ""How now, Walter Blunt,"" said heat last, ""what is to do?""""Why, this,"" said Blunt, wiping his bleeding lip. ""That fellow, MylesFalworth, hath been breeding mutiny and revolt ever sin he came hitheramong us, and because he was thus mutinous I would punish him therefor.""""In that thou liest!"" burst out Myles. ""Never have I been mutinous in mylife.""""Be silent, sir,"" said Sir James, sternly. ""I will hear thee anon.""""Nay,"" said Myles, with his lips twitching and writhing, ""I will not besilent. I am friendless here, and ye are all against me, but I will notbe silent, and brook to have lies spoken of me.""Even Blunt stood aghast at Myles\'s boldness. Never had he heard any oneso speak to Sir James before. He did not dare for the moment even tolook up. Second after second of dead stillness passed, while Sir Jamessat looking at Myles with a stern, terrifying calmness that chilled himin spite of the heat of his passion.""Sir,"" said the old man at last, in a hard, quiet voice, ""thou dost knownaught of rules and laws of such a place as this. Nevertheless, itis time for thee to learn them. So I will tell thee now that if thouopenest thy lips to say only one single word more except at my bidding,I will send thee to the black vault of the donjon to cool thy hotspirits on bread and water for a week."" There was something in themeasured quietness of the old knight\'s tone that quelled Myles utterlyand entirely. A little space of silence followed. ""Now, then, Blunt,""said Sir James, turning to the bachelor, ""tell me all the ins and outsof this business without any more underdealing.""This time Blunt\'s story, though naturally prejudiced in his own favor,was fairly true. Then Myles told his side of the case, the old knightlistening attentively.""Why, how now, Blunt,"" said Sir James, when Myles had ended, ""I myselfgave the lads leave to go to the river to bathe. Wherefore shouldst thouforbid one of them?""""I did it but to punish this fellow for his mutiny,"" said the bachelor.""Methought we at their head were to have oversight concerning them.""""So ye are,"" said the knight; ""but only to a degree. Ere ye take it uponye to gainsay any of my orders or permits, come ye first to me. Dostthou understand?""""Aye,"" answered Blunt, sullenly.""So be it, and now get thee gone,"" said the knight; ""and let me hear nomore of beating out brains with wooden clogs. An ye fight your battles,let there not be murder in them. This is twice that the like hathhapped; gin I hear more of such doings--"" He did utter his threat, butstopped short, and fixed his one eye sternly upon the head squire. ""Nowshake hands, and be ye friends,"" said he, abruptly.Blunt made a motion to obey, but Myles put his hand behind him.""Nay, I shake not hands with any one who struck me while I was down.""""So be it,"" said the knight, grimly. ""Now thou mayst go, Blunt. Thou,Falworth, stay; I would bespeak thee further.""""Tell me,"" said he, when the elder lad had left them, ""why wilt thou notserve these bachelors as the other squires do? Such is the custom here.Why wilt thou not obey it?""""Because,"" said Myles, ""I cannot stomach it, and they shall not make meserve them. An thou bid me do it, sir, I will do it; but not at theircommand.""""Nay,"" said the knight, ""I do not bid thee do them service. That liethwith thee, to render or not, as thou seest fit. But how canst thou hopeto fight single-handed against the commands of a dozen lads all olderand mightier than thou?""""I know not,"" said Myles; ""but were they an hundred, instead ofthirteen, they should not make me serve them.""""Thou art a fool!"" said the old knight, smiling faintly, ""for that be\'stnot courage, but folly. When one setteth about righting a wrong, onedriveth not full head against it, for in so doing one getteth naught buthard knocks. Nay, go deftly about it, and then, when the time is ripe,strike the blow. Now our beloved King Henry, when he was the Earl ofDerby, what could he have gained had he stood so against the old KingRichard, brooking the King face to face? I tell thee he would have beenknocked on the head as thou wert like to have been this day. Now wereI thee, and had to fight a fight against odds, I would first get mefriends behind me, and then--"" He stopped short, but Myles understoodhim well enough.""Sir,"" said he, with a gulp, ""I do thank thee for thy friendship, andask thy pardon for doing as I did anon.""""I grant thee pardon,"" said the knight, ""but tell thee plainly, an thoudost face me so again, I will truly send thee to the black cell for aweek. Now get thee away.""All the other lads were gone when Myles came forth, save only thefaithful Gascoyne, who sacrificed his bath that day to stay with hisfriend; and perhaps that little act of self-denial moved Myles more thanmany a great thing might have done.""It was right kind of thee, Francis,"" said he, laying his handaffectionately on his friend\'s shoulder. ""I know not why thou lovest meso.""""Why, for one thing, this matter,"" answered his friend; ""becausemethinks thou art the best fighter and the bravest one of all of ussquires.""Myles laughed. Nevertheless Gascoyne\'s words were a soothing balm formuch that had happened that day. ""I will fight me no more just now,""said he; and then he told his friend all that Sir James had advisedabout biding his time.Gascoyne blew a long whistle. ""Beshrew me!"" quoth he, ""but methinks oldBruin is on thy side of the quarrel, Myles. An that be so, I am withthee also, and others that I can name as well.""""So be it,"" said Myles. ""Then am I content to abide the time when we maybecome strong enough to stand against them.""']"
82,11,Chapter 11,"['10Perhaps there is nothing more delightful in the romance of boyhood thanthe finding of some secret hiding-place whither a body may creep awayfrom the bustle of the world\'s life, to nestle in quietness for an houror two. More especially is such delightful if it happen that, bypeeping from out it, one may look down upon the bustling matters ofbusy every-day life, while one lies snugly hidden away unseen by any, asthough one were in some strange invisible world of one\'s own.Such a hiding-place as would have filled the heart of almost any boywith sweet delight Myles and Gascoyne found one summer afternoon. Theycalled it their Eyry, and the name suited well for the roosting-placeof the young hawks that rested in its windy stillness, looking down uponthe shifting castle life in the courts below.Behind the north stable, a great, long, rambling building, thick-walled,and black with age, lay an older part of the castle than that peopledby the better class of life--a cluster of great thick walls, rudely butstrongly built, now the dwelling-place of stable-lads and hinds, swineand poultry. From one part of these ancient walls, and fronting an innercourt of the castle, arose a tall, circular, heavy-buttressed tower,considerably higher than the other buildings, and so mantled with adense growth of aged ivy as to stand a shaft of solid green. Above itscrumbling crown circled hundreds of pigeons, white and pied, clappingand clattering in noisy flight through the sunny air. Several windows,some closed with shutters, peeped here and there from out the leaves,and near the top of the pile was a row of arched openings, as though ofa balcony or an airy gallery.Myles had more than once felt an idle curiosity about this tower, andone day, as he and Gascoyne sat together, he pointed his finger andsaid, ""What is yon place?""""That,"" answered Gascoyne, looking over his shoulder--""that they callBrutus Tower, for why they do say that Brutus he built it when he camehither to Britain. I believe not the tale mine own self; ne\'theless, itis marvellous ancient, and old Robin-the-Fletcher telleth me that therebe stairways built in the wall and passage-ways, and a maze whereina body may get lost, an he know not the way aright, and never see theblessed light of day again.""""Marry,"" said Myles, ""those same be strange sayings. Who liveth therenow?""""No one liveth there,"" said Gascoyne, ""saving only some of the stablevillains, and that half-witted goose-herd who flung stones at usyesterday when we mocked him down in the paddock. He and his wife andthose others dwell in the vaults beneath, like rabbits in any warren. Noone else hath lived there since Earl Robert\'s day, which belike wasan hundred years agone. The story goeth that Earl Robert\'s brother--orstep-brother--was murdered there, and some men say by the Earl himself.Sin that day it hath been tight shut.""Myles stared at the tower for a while in silence. ""It is astrange-seeming place from without,"" said he, at last, ""and mayhap itmay be even more strange inside. Hast ever been within, Francis?""""Nay,"" said Gascoyne; ""said I not it hath been fast locked since EarlRobert\'s day?""""By\'r Lady,"" said Myles, ""an I had lived here in this place so long asthou, I wot I would have been within it ere this.""""Beshrew me,"" said Gascoyne, ""but I have never thought of such amatter."" He turned and looked at the tall crown rising into the warmsunlight with a new interest, for the thought of entering it smackedpleasantly of adventure. ""How wouldst thou set about getting within?""said he, presently.""Why, look,"" said Myles; ""seest thou not yon hole in the ivy branches?Methinks there is a window at that place. An I mistake not, it is inreach of the stable eaves. A body might come up by the fagot pile to theroof of the hen-house, and then by the long stable to the north stable,and so to that hole.""Gascoyne looked thoughtfully at the Brutus Tower, and then suddenlyinquired, ""Wouldst go there?""""Aye,"" said Myles, briefly.""So be it. Lead thou the way in the venture, I will follow after thee,""said Gascoyne.As Myles had said, the climbing from roof to roof was a matter easyenough to an active pair of lads like themselves; but when, by-and-by,they reached the wall of the tower itself, they found the hidden windowmuch higher from the roof than they had judged from below--perhaps tenor twelve feet--and it was, besides, beyond the eaves and out of theirreach.Myles looked up and looked down. Above was the bushy thickness of theivy, the branches as thick as a woman\'s wrist, knotted and intertwined;below was the stone pavement of a narrow inner court between two of thestable buildings.""Methinks I can climb to yon place,"" said he.""Thou\'lt break thy neck an thou tryest,"" said Gascoyne, hastily.""Nay,"" quoth Myles, ""I trust not; but break or make, we get not therewithout trying. So here goeth for the venture.""""Thou art a hare-brained knave as ever drew breath of life,"" quothGascoyne, ""and will cause me to come to grief some of these fine days.Ne\'theless, an thou be Jack Fool and lead the way, go, and I will be TomFool and follow anon. If thy neck is worth so little, mine is worth nomore.""It was indeed a perilous climb, but that special providence which guardsreckless lads befriended them, as it has thousands of their kind beforeand since. So, by climbing from one knotted, clinging stem to another,they were presently seated snugly in the ivied niche in the window. Itwas barred from within by a crumbling shutter, the rusty fastening ofwhich, after some little effort upon the part of the two, gave way, andentering the narrow opening, they found themselves in a small triangularpassage-way, from which a steep flight of stone steps led down through ahollow in the massive wall to the room below.At the bottom of the steps was a heavy oaken door, which stood ajar,hanging upon a single rusty hinge, and from the room within a dull, graylight glimmered faintly. Myles pushed the door farther open; it creakedand grated horribly on its rusty hinge, and, as in instant answer tothe discordant shriek, came a faint piping squeaking, a rustling and apattering of soft footsteps.""The ghosts!"" cried Gascoyne, in a quavering whisper, and for a momentMyles felt the chill of goose-flesh creep up and down his spine. But thenext moment he laughed.""Nay,"" said he, ""they be rats. Look at yon fellow, Francis! Be\'st as bigas Mother Joan\'s kitten. Give me that stone."" He flung it at the rat,and it flew clattering across the floor. There was another patteringrustle of hundreds of feet, and then a breathless silence.The boys stood looking around them, and a strange enough sight it was.The room was a perfect circle of about twenty feet across, and waspiled high with an indistinguishable mass of lumber--rude tables, ruderchairs, ancient chests, bits and remnants of cloth and sacking andleather, old helmets and pieces of armor of a by-gone time, brokenspears and pole-axes, pots and pans and kitchen furniture of all sortsand kinds.A straight beam of sunlight fell through a broken shutter like a bar ofgold, and fell upon the floor in a long streak of dazzling light thatilluminated the whole room with a yellow glow.""By \'r Lady!"" said Gascoyne at last, in a hushed voice, ""here is FatherTime\'s garret for sure. Didst ever see the like, Myles? Look at yonarbalist; sure Brutus himself used such an one!""""Nay,"" said Myles; ""but look at this saddle. Marry, here be\'st a rat\'snest in it.""Clouds of dust rose as they rummaged among the mouldering mass, settingthem coughing and sneezing. Now and then a great gray rat would shootout beneath their very feet, and disappear, like a sudden shadow, intosome hole or cranny in the wall.""Come,"" said Myles at last, brushing the dust from his jacket, ""an wetarry here longer we will have chance to see no other sights; the sun isfalling low.""An arched stair-way upon the opposite side of the room from which theyhad entered wound upward through the wall, the stone steps being lightedby narrow slits of windows cut through the massive masonry. Above theroom they had just left was another of the same shape and size, but withan oak floor, sagging and rising into hollows and hills, where the joisthad rotted away beneath. It was bare and empty, and not even a ratwas to be seen. Above was another room; above that, another; all thepassages and stairways which connected the one story with the otherbeing built in the wall, which was, where solid, perhaps fifteen feetthick.From the third floor a straight flight of steps led upward to a closeddoor, from the other side of which shone the dazzling brightness ofsunlight, and whence came a strange noise--a soft rustling, a melodiousmurmur. The boys put their shoulders against the door, which wasfastened, and pushed with might and main--once, twice; suddenly thelock gave way, and out they pitched headlong into a blaze of sunlight.A deafening clapping and uproar sounded in their ears, and scores ofpigeons, suddenly disturbed, rose in stormy flight.They sat up and looked around them in silent wonder. They were in abower of leafy green. It was the top story of the tower, the roof ofwhich had crumbled and toppled in, leaving it open to the sky, with onlyhere and there a slanting beam or two supporting a portion of the tiledroof, affording shelter for the nests of the pigeons crowded closelytogether. Over everything the ivy had grown in a mantling sheet--anet-work of shimmering green, through which the sunlight fellflickering.""This passeth wonder,"" said Gascoyne, at last breaking the silence.""Aye,"" said Myles, ""I did never see the like in all my life."" Then,""Look, yonder is a room beyond; let us see what it is, Francis.""Entering an arched door-way, the two found themselves in a beautifullittle vaulted chapel, about eighteen feet long and twelve or fifteenwide. It comprised the crown of one of the large massive buttresses, andfrom it opened the row of arched windows which could be seen from belowthrough the green shimmering of the ivy leaves. The boys pushed asidethe trailing tendrils and looked out and down. The whole castle layspread below them, with the busy people unconsciously intent upon thematters of their daily work. They could see the gardener, with bowedback, patiently working among the flowers in the garden, the stable-boysbelow grooming the horses, a bevy of ladies in the privy garden playingat shuttlecock with battledoors of wood, a group of gentlemen walkingup and down in front of the Earl\'s house. They could see the householdservants hurrying hither and thither, two little scullions atfisticuffs, and a kitchen girl standing in the door-way scratching herfrowzy head.It was all like a puppetshow of real life, each acting unconsciously apart in the play. The cool wind came in through the rustling leaves andfanned their cheeks, hot with the climb up the winding stair-way.""We will call it our Eyry,"" said Gascoyne ""and we will be the hawks thatlive here."" And that was how it got its name.The next day Myles had the armorer make him a score of large spikes,which he and Gascoyne drove between the ivy branches and into the cementof the wall, and so made a safe passageway by which to reach the windowniche in the wall.']"
82,12,Chapter 12,"['11THE TWO friends kept the secret of the Eyry to themselves for a littlewhile, now and then visiting the old tower to rummage among the lumberstored in the lower room, or to loiter away the afternoon in the windysolitudes of the upper heights. And in that little time, when theancient keep was to them a small world unknown to any but themselves--aworld far away above all the dull matters of every-day life--they talkedof many things that might else never have been known to one another.Mostly they spoke the crude romantic thoughts and desires of boyhood\'stime--chaff thrown to the wind, in which, however, lay a few strayseeds, fated to fall to good earth, and to ripen to fruition inmanhood\'s day.In the intimate talks of that time Myles imparted something of hishonest solidity to Gascoyne\'s somewhat weathercock nature, and toMyles\'s ruder and more uncouth character Gascoyne lent a tone of hisgentler manners, learned in his pagehood service as attendant upon theCountess and her ladies.In other things, also, the character and experience of the one ladhelped to supply what was lacking in the other. Myles was replete withold Latin gestes, fables, and sermons picked up during his school life,in those intervals of his more serious studies when Prior Edward hadpermitted him to browse in the greener pastures of the Gesta Romanorumand the Disciplina Clericalis of the monastery library, and Gascoyne wasnever weary of hearing him tell those marvellous stories culled from thecrabbed Latin of the old manuscript volumes.Upon his part Gascoyne was full of the lore of the waiting-room andthe antechamber, and Myles, who in all his life had never known a lady,young or old, excepting his mother, was never tired of lying silentlylistening to Gascoyne\'s chatter of the gay doings of the castlegentle-life, in which he had taken part so often in the merry days ofhis pagehood.""I do wonder,"" said Myles, quaintly, ""that thou couldst ever find thecourage to bespeak a young maid, Francis. Never did I do so, nor evercould. Rather would I face three strong men than one young damsel.""Whereupon Gascoyne burst out laughing. ""Marry!"" quoth he, ""they beno such terrible things, but gentle and pleasant spoken, and soft andsmooth as any cat.""""No matter for that,"" said Myles; ""I would not face one such forworlds.""It was during the short time when, so to speak, the two owned thesolitude of the Brutus Tower, that Myles told his friend of his father\'soutlawry and of the peril in which the family stood. And thus it was.""I do marvel,"" said Gascoyne one day, as the two lay stretched in theEyry, looking down into the castle court-yard below--""I do marvel, nowthat thou art \'stablished here this month and more, that my Lord dothnever have thee called to service upon household duty. Canst thou riddleme why it is so, Myles?""The subject was a very sore one with Myles. Until Sir James had told himof the matter in his office that day he had never known that his fatherwas attainted and outlawed. He had accepted the change from theirearlier state and the bald poverty of their life at Crosbey-Holt withthe easy carelessness of boyhood, and Sir James\'s words were the firstto awaken him to a realization of the misfortunes of the house ofFalworth. His was a brooding nature, and in the three or four weeksthat passed he had meditated so much over what had been told him, thatby-and-by it almost seemed as if a shadow of shame rested upon hisfather\'s fair fame, even though the attaint set upon him was unrighteousand unjust, as Myles knew it must be. He had felt angry and resentfulat the Earl\'s neglect, and as days passed and he was not noticed in anyway, his heart was at times very bitter.So now Gascoyne\'s innocent question touched a sore spot, and Myles spokewith a sharp, angry pain in his voice that made the other look quicklyup. ""Sooner would my Lord have yonder swineherd serve him in thehousehold than me,"" said he.""Why may that be, Myles?"" said Gascoyne.""Because,"" answered Myles, with the same angry bitterness in his voice,""either the Earl is a coward that feareth to befriend me, or else he isa caitiff, ashamed of his own flesh and blood, and of me, the son of hisone-time comrade.""Gascoyne raised himself upon his elbow, and opened his eyes wide inwonder. ""Afeard of thee, Myles!"" quoth he. ""Why should he be afeared tobefriend thee? Who art thou that the Earl should fear thee?""Myles hesitated for a moment or two; wisdom bade him remain silentupon the dangerous topic, but his heart yearned for sympathy andcompanionship in his trouble. ""I will tell thee,"" said he, suddenly,and therewith poured out all of the story, so far as he knew it, to hislistening, wondering friend, and his heart felt lighter to be thus easedof its burden. ""And now,"" said he, as he concluded, ""is not this Earla mean-hearted caitiff to leave me, the son of his one-time friend andkinsman, thus to stand or to fall alone among strangers and in astrange place without once stretching me a helping hand?"" He waited, andGascoyne knew that he expected an answer.""I know not that he is a mean-hearted caitiff, Myles,"" said he at last,hesitatingly. ""The Earl hath many enemies, and I have heard that he hathstood more than once in peril, having been accused of dealings withthe King\'s foes. He was cousin to the Earl of Kent, and I do rememberhearing that he had a narrow escape at that time from ruin. There bemore reasons than thou wottest of why he should not have dealings withthy father.""""I had not thought,"" said Myles, bitterly, after a little pause, ""thatthou wouldst stand up for him and against me in this quarrel, Gascoyne.Him will I never forgive so long as I may live, and I had thought thatthou wouldst have stood by me.""""So I do,"" said Gascoyne, hastily, ""and do love thee more than any onein all the world, Myles; but I had thought that it would make thee feelmore easy, to think that the Earl was not against thee. And, indeed,from all thou has told me, I do soothly think that he and Sir James meanto befriend thee and hold thee privily in kind regard.""""Then why doth he not stand forth like a man and befriend me and myfather openly, even if it be to his own peril?"" said Myles, revertingstubbornly to what he had first spoken.Gascoyne did not answer, but lay for a long while in silence. ""Knowestthou,"" he suddenly asked, after a while, ""who is this great enemy ofwhom Sir James speaketh, and who seeketh so to drive thy father toruin?""""Nay,"" said Myles, ""I know not, for my father hath never spoken of thesethings, and Sir James would not tell me. But this I know,"" said he,suddenly, grinding his teeth together, ""an I do not hunt him out someday and slay him like a dog--"" He stopped abruptly, and Gascoyne,looking askance at him, saw that his eyes were full of tears, whereuponhe turned his looks away again quickly, and fell to shooting pebbles outthrough the open window with his finger and thumb.""Thou wilt tell no one of these things that I have said?"" said Myles,after a while.""Not I,"" said Gascoyne. ""Thinkest thou I could do such a thing?""""Nay,"" said Myles, briefly.Perhaps this talk more than anything else that had ever passed betweenthem knit the two friends the closer together, for, as I have said,Myles felt easier now that he had poured out his bitter thoughts andwords; and as for Gascoyne, I think that there is nothing so flatteringto one\'s soul as to be made the confidant of a stronger nature.But the old tower served another purpose than that of a spot in whichto pass away a few idle hours, or in which to indulge the confidences offriendship, for it was there that Myles gathered a backing of strengthfor resistance against the tyranny of the bachelors, and it is for thatmore than for any other reason that it has been told how they found theplace and of what they did there, feeling secure against interruption.Myles Falworth was not of a kind that forgets or neglects a thing uponwhich the mind has once been set. Perhaps his chief objective sincethe talk with Sir James following his fight in the dormitory had beensuccessful resistance to the exactions of the head of the body ofsquires. He was now (more than a month had passed) looked upon by nearlyif not all of the younger lads as an acknowledged leader in his ownclass. So one day he broached a matter to Gascoyne that had for sometime been digesting in his mind. It was the formation of a secret order,calling themselves the ""Knights of the Rose,"" their meeting-place to bethe chapel of the Brutus Tower, and their object to be the rightingof wrongs, ""as they,"" said Myles, ""of Arthur his Round-table did rightwrongs.""""But, prithee, what wrongs are there to right in this place?"" quothGascoyne, after listening intently to the plan which Myles set forth.""Why, first of all, this,"" said Myles, clinching his fists, as he had ahabit of doing when anything stirred him deeply, ""that we set those vilebachelors to their right place; and that is, that they be no longer ourmasters, but our fellows.""Gascoyne shook his head. He hated clashing and conflict above allthings, and was for peace. Why should they thus rush to thrustthemselves into trouble? Let matters abide as they were a little longer;surely life was pleasant enough without turning it all topsy-turvy.Then, with a sort of indignation, why should Myles, who had only comeamong them a month, take such service more to heart than they who hadendured it for years? And, finally, with the hopefulness of so many ofthe rest of us, he advised Myles to let matters alone, and they wouldright themselves in time.But Myles\'s mind was determined; his active spirit could not brookresting passively under a wrong; he would endure no longer, and now ornever they must make their stand.""But look thee, Myles Falworth,"" said Gascoyne, ""all this is not tobe done withouten fighting shrewdly. Wilt thou take that fighting uponthine own self? As for me, I tell thee I love it not.""""Why, aye,"" said Myles; ""I ask no man to do what I will not do myself.""Gascoyne shrugged his shoulders. ""So be it,"" said he. ""An thou hastappetite to run thy head against hard knocks, do it i\' mercy\'s name! Ifor one will stand thee back while thou art taking thy raps.""There was a spirit of drollery in Gascoyne\'s speech that rubbed againstMyles\'s earnestness.""Out upon it!"" cried he, his patience giving way. ""Seest not that Iam in serious earnest? Why then dost thou still jest like Mad Noll, myLord\'s fool? An thou wilt not lend me thine aid in this matter, say soand ha\' done with it, and I will bethink me of somewhere else to turn.""Then Gascoyne yielded at once, as he always did when his friend lost histemper, and having once assented to it, entered into the scheme heartand soul. Three other lads--one of them that tall thin squire EdmundWilkes, before spoken of--were sounded upon the subject. They alsoentered into the plan of the secret organization with an enthusiasmwhich might perhaps not have been quite so glowing had they realized howvery soon Myles designed embarking upon active practical operations.One day Myles and Gascoyne showed them the strange things that theyhad discovered in the old tower--the inner staircases, the windingpassage-ways, the queer niches and cupboard, and the black shaft of awell that pierced down into the solid wall, and whence, perhaps, the oldcastle folk had one time drawn their supply of water in time of siege,and with every new wonder of the marvellous place the enthusiasm of thethree recruits rose higher and higher. They rummaged through the lumberpile in the great circular room as Myles and Gascoyne had done, and atlast, tired out, they ascended to the airy chapel, and there sat coolingthemselves in the rustling freshness of the breeze that came blowingbriskly in through the arched windows.It was then and there that the five discussed and finally determinedupon the detailed plans of their organization, canvassing the names ofthe squirehood, and selecting from it a sufficient number of bold anddaring spirits to make up a roll of twenty names in all.Gascoyne had, as I said, entered into the matter with spirit, andperhaps it was owing more to him than to any other that the projectcaught its delightful flavor of romance.""Perchance,"" said he, as the five lads lay in the rustling stillnessthrough which sounded the monotonous and ceaseless cooing of thepigeons--""perchance there may be dwarfs and giants and dragons andenchanters and evil knights and what not even nowadays. And who knowsbut that if we Knights of the Rose hold together we may go forth intothe world, and do battle with them, and save beautiful ladies, andhave tales and gestes written about us as they are writ about the SevenChampions and Arthur his Round-table.""Perhaps Myles, who lay silently listening to all that was said, was theonly one who looked upon the scheme at all in the light of real utility,but I think that even with him the fun of the matter outweighed theserious part of the business.So it was that the Sacred Order of the Twenty Knights of the Rosecame to be initiated. They appointed a code of secret passwords andcountersigns which were very difficult to remember, and which were onlyused when they might excite the curiosity of the other and uninitiatedboys by their mysterious sound. They elected Myles as their Grand HighCommander, and held secret meetings in the ancient tower, where manymysteries were soberly enacted.Of course in a day or two all the body of squires knew nearly everythingconcerning the Knights of the Rose, and of their secret meetings inthe old tower. The lucky twenty were the objects of envy of all not sofortunate as to be included in this number, and there was a marked airof secrecy about everything they did that appealed to every romanticnotion of the youngsters looking on. What was the stormy outcome of itall is now presently to be told.']"
82,13,Chapter 13,"['12Thus it was that Myles, with an eye to open war with the bachelors,gathered a following to his support. It was some little while beforematters were brought to a crisis--a week or ten days. Perhaps even Myleshad no great desire to hasten matters. He knew that whenever war wasdeclared, he himself would have to bear the brunt of the battle, andeven the bravest man hesitates before deliberately thrusting himselfinto a fight.One morning Myles and Gascoyne and Wilkes sat under the shade of twotrees, between which was a board nailed to the trunks, making a rudebench--always a favorite lounging-place for the lads in idle moments.Myles was polishing his bascinet with lard and wood-ashes, rubbing themetal with a piece of leather, and wiping it clean with a fustian rag.The other two, who had just been relieved from household duty, lay atlength idly looking on.Just then one of the smaller pages, a boy of twelve or thirteen, by nameRobin Ingoldsby, crossed the court. He had been crying; his face was redand blubbered, and his body was still shaken with convulsive sniffs.Myles looked up. ""Come hither, Robin,"" he called from where he sat.""What is to do?""The little fellow came slowly up to where the three rested in the shade.""Mowbray beat me with a strap,"" said he, rubbing his sleeve across hiseyes, and catching his breath at the recollection.""Beat thee, didst say?"" said Myles, drawing his brows together. ""Why didhe beat thee?""""Because,"" said Robin, ""I tarried overlong in fetching a pot of beerfrom the buttery for him and Wyatt."" Then, with a boy\'s sudden and easyquickness in forgetting past troubles, ""Tell me, Falworth,"" said he,""when wilt thou give me that knife thou promised me--the one thou breakthe blade of yesterday?""""I know not,"" said Myles, bluntly, vexed that the boy did not takethe disgrace of his beating more to heart. ""Some time soon, mayhap. Methinks thou shouldst think more of thy beating than of a broken knife.Now get thee gone to thy business.""The youngster lingered for a moment or two watching Myles at his work.""What is that on the leather scrap, Falworth?"" said he, curiously.""Lard and ashes,"" said Myles, testily. ""Get thee gone, I say, or Iwill crack thy head for thee;"" and he picked up a block of wood, with athreatening gesture.The youngster made a hideous grimace, and then scurried away, duckinghis head, lest in spite of Myles\'s well-known good-nature the blockshould come whizzing after him.""Hear ye that now!"" cried Myles, flinging down the block again andturning to his two friends. ""Beaten with straps because, forsooth, hewould not fetch and carry quickly enough to please the haste of thesebachelors. Oh, this passeth patience, and I for one will bear it nolonger.""""Nay, Myles,"" said Gascoyne, soothingly, ""the little imp is as lazy as adormouse and as mischievous as a monkey. I\'ll warrant the hiding was hisdue, and that more of the like would do him good.""""Why, how dost thou talk, Francis!"" said Myles, turning upon himindignantly. ""Thou knowest that thou likest to see the boy beaten nomore than I."" Then, after a meditative pause, ""How many, think ye, wemuster of our company of the Rose today?""Wilkes looked doubtfully at Gascoyne. ""There be only seventeen of ushere now,"" said he at last. ""Brinton and Lambourne are away to RobyCastle in Lord George\'s train, and will not be back till Saturday next.And Watt Newton is in the infirmary.""Seventeen be\'st enou,"" said Myles, grimly. ""Let us get together thisafternoon, such as may, in the Brutus Tower, for I, as I did say, willno longer suffer these vile bachelors.""Gascoyne and Wilkes exchanged looks, and then the former blew a longwhistle.So that afternoon a gloomy set of young faces were gathered together inthe Eyry--fifteen of the Knights of the Rose--and all knew why they wereassembled. The talk which followed was conducted mostly by Myles. Headdressed the others with a straightforward vim and earnestness, but theresponse was only half-hearted, and when at last, having heated himselfup with his own fire, he sat down, puffing out his red cheeks andglaring round, a space of silence followed, the lads looked doubtfullyat one another. Myles felt the chill of their silence strike coldly onhis enthusiasm, and it vexed him.""What wouldst thou do, Falworth?"" said one of the knights, at last.""Wouldst have us open a quarrel with the bachelors?""""Nay,"" said Myles, gruffly. ""I had thought that ye would all lend me ahand in a pitched battle but now I see that ye ha\' no stomach for that.Ne\'theless, I tell ye plainly I will not submit longer to the bachelors.So now I will ask ye not to take any venture upon yourselves, but onlythis: that ye will stand by me when I do my fighting, and not let fiveor seven of them fall upon me at once.""There is Walter Blunt; he is parlous strong,"" said one of the others,after a time of silence. ""Methinks he could conquer any two of us.""""Nay,"" said Myles; ""ye do fear him too greatly. I tell ye I fear not tostand up to try battle with him and will do so, too, if the need arise.Only say ye that ye will stand by my back.""""Marry,"" said Gascoyne, quaintly, ""an thou wilt dare take the heavy endupon thee, I for one am willing to stand by and see that thou have thyfill of fighting.""""I too will stand thee by, Myles,"" said Edmund Wilkes.""And I, and I, and I,"" said others, chiming in.Those who would still have held back were carried along by the stream,and so it was settled that if the need should arise for Myles to doa bit of fighting, the others should stand by to see that he had fairplay.""When thinkest thou that thou wilt take thy stand against them, Myles?""asked Wilkes.Myles hesitated a moment. ""To-morrow,"" said he, grimly.Several of the lads whistled softly.Gascoyne was prepared for an early opening of the war, but perhaps notfor such an early opening as this. ""By \'r Lady, Myles, thou art hungryfor brawling,"" said he.']"
82,14,Chapter 14,"['13After the first excitement of meeting, discussing, and deciding hadpassed, Myles began to feel the weight of the load he had so boldlytaken upon himself. He began to reckon what a serious thing it was forhim to stand as a single champion against the tyranny that had grownso strong through years of custom. Had he let himself do so, he mightalmost have repented, but it was too late now for repentance. He hadlaid his hand to the plough, and he must drive the furrow.Somehow the news of impending battle had leaked out among the rest ofthe body of squires, and a buzz of suppressed excitement hummed throughthe dormitory that evening. The bachelors, to whom, no doubt, vaguerumors had been blown, looked lowering, and talked together in lowvoices, standing apart in a group. Some of them made a rather markedshow of secreting knives in the straw of their beds, and no doubt it hadits effect upon more than one young heart that secretly thrilled at thesight of the shining blades. However, all was undisturbed that evening.The lights were put out, and the lads retired with more than usualquietness, only for the murmur of whispering.All night Myles\'s sleep was more or less disturbed by dreams in which hewas now conquering, now being conquered, and before the day had fairlybroken he was awake. He lay upon his cot, keying himself up for theencounter which he had set upon himself to face, and it would not bethe truth to say that the sight of those knives hidden in the strawthe night before had made no impression upon him. By-and-by he knew theothers were beginning to awake, for he heard them softly stirring, andas the light grew broad and strong, saw them arise, one by one, andbegin dressing in the gray morning. Then he himself arose and put on hisdoublet and hose, strapping his belt tightly about his waist; then hesat down on the side of his cot.Presently that happened for which he was waiting; two of the youngersquires started to bring the bachelors\' morning supply of water. As theycrossed the room Myles called to them in a loud voice--a little uneven,perhaps: ""Stop! We draw no more water for any one in this house, savingonly for ourselves. Set ye down those buckets, and go back to yourplaces!""The two lads stopped, half turned, and then stood still, holding thethree buckets undecidedly.In a moment all was uproar and confusion, for by this time every oneof the lads had arisen, some sitting on the edge of their beds, somenearly, others quite dressed. A half-dozen of the Knights of the Rosecame over to where Myles stood, gathering in a body behind him and theothers followed, one after another.The bachelors were hardly prepared for such prompt and vigorous action.""What is to do?"" cried one of them, who stood near the two lads with thebuckets. ""Why fetch ye not the water?""""Falworth says we shall not fetch it,"" answered one of the lads, a boyby the name of Gosse.""What mean ye by that, Falworth?"" the young man called to Myles.Myles\'s heart was beating thickly and heavily within him, butnevertheless he spoke up boldly enough. ""I mean,"" said he, ""that fromhenceforth ye shall fetch and carry for yourselves.""""Look\'ee, Blunt,"" called the bachelor; ""here is Falworth says theysquires will fetch no more water for us.""The head bachelor had heard all that had passed, and was even thenhastily slipping on his doublet and hose. ""Now, then, Falworth,"" said heat last, striding forward, ""what is to do? Ye will fetch no more water,eh? By \'r Lady, I will know the reason why.""He was still advancing towards Myles, with two or three of the olderbachelors at his heels, when Gascoyne spoke.""Thou hadst best stand back, Blunt,"" said he, ""else thou mayst be hurt.We will not have ye bang Falworth again as ye once did, so stand thouback!""Blunt stopped short and looked upon the lads standing behind Myles, someof them with faces a trifle pale perhaps, but all grim and determinedlooking enough. Then he turned upon his heel suddenly, and walked backto the far end of the dormitory, where the bachelors were presentlyclustered together. A few words passed between them, and then thethirteen began at once arming themselves, some with wooden clogs,and some with the knives which they had so openly concealed thenight before. At the sign of imminent battle, all those not activelyinterested scuttled away to right and left, climbing up on the benchesand cots, and leaving a free field to the combatants. The next momentwould have brought bloodshed.Now Myles, thanks to the training of the Crosbey-Dale smith, felttolerably sure that in a wrestling bout he was a match--perhaps morethan a match--for any one of the body of squires, and he had determined,if possible, to bring the battle to a single-handed encounter upon thatfooting. Accordingly he suddenly stepped forward before the others.""Look\'ee, fellow,"" he called to Blunt, ""thou art he who struck me whilstI was down some while since. Wilt thou let this quarrel stand betweenthee and me, and meet me man to man without weapon? See, I throw medown mine own, and will meet thee with bare hands."" And as he spoke, hetossed the clog he held in his hand back upon the cot.""So be it,"" said Blunt, with great readiness, tossing down a similarweapon which he himself held.""Do not go, Myles,"" cried Gascoyne, ""he is a villain and a traitor, andwould betray thee to thy death. I saw him when he first gat from bedhide a knife in his doublet.""""Thou liest!"" said Blunt. ""I swear, by my faith, I be barehanded as yesee me! Thy friend accuses me, Myles Falworth, because he knoweth thouart afraid of me.""""There thou liest most vilely!"" exclaimed Myles. ""Swear that thou hastno knife, and I will meet thee.""""Hast thou not heard me say that I have no knife?"" said Blunt. ""Whatmore wouldst thou have?""""Then I will meet thee halfway,"" said Myles.Gascoyne caught him by the sleeve, and would have withheld him, assuringhim that he had seen the bachelor conceal a knife. But Myles, hot forthe fight, broke away from his friend without listening to him.As the two advanced steadily towards one another a breathless silencefell upon the dormitory in sharp contrast to the uproar and confusionthat had filled it a moment before. The lads, standing some uponbenches, some upon beds, all watched with breathless interest themeeting of the two champions.As they approached one another they stopped and stood for a moment alittle apart, glaring the one upon the other. They seemed ill enoughmatched; Blunt was fully half a head taller than Myles, and wasthick-set and close-knit in young manhood. Nothing but Myles\'s undauntedpluck could have led him to dare to face an enemy so much older andstouter than himself.The pause was only for a moment. They who looked saw Blunt slide hishand furtively towards his bosom. Myles saw too, and in the flash of aninstant knew what the gesture meant, and sprang upon the other beforethe hand could grasp what it sought. As he clutched his enemy he feltwhat he had in that instant expected to feel--the handle of a dagger.The next moment he cried, in a loud voice: ""Oh, thou villain! Help,Gascoyne! He hath a knife under his doublet!""In answer to his cry for help, Myles\'s friends started to his aid. Butthe bachelors shouted, ""Stand back and let them fight it out alone, elsewe will knife ye too."" And as they spoke, some of them leaped from thebenches whereon they stood, drawing their knives and flourishing them.For just a few seconds Myles\'s friends stood cowed, and in those fewseconds the fight came to an end with a suddenness unexpected to all.A struggle fierce and silent followed between the two; Blunt strivingto draw his knife, and Myles, with the energy of despair, holding himtightly by the wrist. It was in vain the elder lad writhed and twisted;he was strong enough to overbear Myles, but still was not able to clutchthe haft of his knife.""Thou shalt not draw it!"" gasped Myles at last. ""Thou shalt not stabme!""Then again some of his friends started forward to his aid, but they werenot needed, for before they came, the fight was over.Blunt, finding that he was not able to draw the weapon, suddenly ceasedhis endeavors, and flung his arms around Myles, trying to bear him downupon the ground, and in that moment his battle was lost.In an instant--so quick, so sudden, so unexpected that no one could seehow it happened--his feet were whirled away from under him, he spun withflying arms across Myles\'s loins, and pitched with a thud upon the stonepavement, where he lay still, motionless, while Myles, his face whitewith passion and his eyes gleaming, stood glaring around like a youngwild-boar beset by the dogs.The next moment the silence was broken, and the uproar broke forthwith redoubled violence. The bachelors, leaping from the benches, camehurrying forward on one side, and Myles\'s friends from the other.""Thou shalt smart for this, Falworth,"" said one of the older lads.""Belike thou hast slain him!""Myles turned upon the speaker like a flash, and with such a passion offury in his face that the other, a fellow nearly a head taller than he,shrank back, cowed in spite of himself. Then Gascoyne came and laid hishand on his friend\'s shoulder.""Who touches me?"" cried Myles, hoarsely, turning sharply upon him; andthen, seeing who it was, ""Oh, Francis, they would ha\' killed me!""""Come away, Myles,"" said Gascoyne; ""thou knowest not what thou doest;thou art mad; come away. What if thou hadst killed him?""The words called Myles somewhat to himself. ""I care not!"" said he, butsullenly and not passionately, and then he suffered Gascoyne and Wilkesto lead him away.Meantime Blunt\'s friends had turned him over, and, after feeling histemples, his wrist, and his heart, bore him away to a bench at the farend of the room. There they fell to chafing his hands and sprinklingwater in his face, a crowd of the others gathering about. Blunt washidden from Myles by those who stood around, and the lad listened to thebroken talk that filled the room with its confusion, his anxiety growingkeener as he became cooler. But at last, with a heartfelt joy, hegathered from the confused buzz of words that the other lad had openedhis eyes and, after a while, he saw him sit up, leaning his head uponthe shoulder of one of his fellow-bachelors, white and faint and sick asdeath.""Thank Heaven that thou didst not kill him!"" said Edmund Wilkes, whohad been standing with the crowd looking on at the efforts of Blunt\'sfriends to revive him, and who had now come and sat down upon the bednot far from Myles.""Aye,"" said Myles, gruffly, ""I do thank Heaven for that.""']"
82,15,Chapter 15,"['14If Myles fancied that one single victory over his enemy would cure theevil against which he fought, he was grievously mistaken; wrongs are notrighted so easily as that. It was only the beginning. Other and far morebitter battles lay before him ere he could look around him and say, ""Ihave won the victory.""For a day--for two days--the bachelors were demoralized at the fall oftheir leader, and the Knights of the Rose were proportionately uplifted.The day that Blunt met his fall, the wooden tank in which the waterhad been poured every morning was found to have been taken away. Thebachelors made a great show of indignation and inquiry. Who was it stoletheir tank? If they did but know, he should smart for it.""Ho! ho!"" roared Edmund Wilkes, so that the whole dormitory heard him,""smoke ye not their tricks, lads? See ye not that they have stolen theirown water-tank, so that they might have no need for another fight overthe carrying of the water?""The bachelors made an obvious show of not having heard what he said, anda general laugh went around. No one doubted that Wilkes had spoken thetruth in his taunt, and that the bachelors had indeed stolen their owntank. So no more water was ever carried for the head squires, but it wasplain to see that the war for the upperhand was not yet over.Even if Myles had entertained comforting thoughts to the contrary, hewas speedily undeceived. One morning, about a week after the fight, ashe and Gascoyne were crossing the armory court, they were hailed bya group of the bachelors standing at the stone steps of the greatbuilding.""Holloa, Falworth!"" they cried. ""Knowest thou that Blunt is nigh wellagain?""""Nay,"" said Myles, ""I knew it not. But I am right glad to hear it.""""Thou wilt sing a different song anon,"" said one of the bachelors. ""Itell thee he is hot against thee, and swears when he cometh again hewill carve thee soothly.""""Aye, marry!"" said another. ""I would not be in thy skin a week hence fora ducat! Only this morning he told Philip Mowbray that he would have thyblood for the fall thou gavest him. Look to thyself, Falworth; he comethagain Wednesday or Thursday next; thou standest in a parlous state.""""Myles,"" said Gascoyne, as they entered the great quadrangle, ""I doindeed fear me that he meaneth to do thee evil.""""I know not,"" said Myles, boldly; ""but I fear him not."" Nevertheless hisheart was heavy with the weight of impending ill.One evening the bachelors were more than usually noisy in their end ofthe dormitory, laughing and talking and shouting to one another.""Holloa, you sirrah, Falworth!"" called one of them along the length ofthe room. ""Blunt cometh again to-morrow day.""Myles saw Gascoyne direct a sharp glance at him; but he answered nothingeither to his enemy\'s words or his friend\'s look.As the bachelor had said, Blunt came the next morning. It was just afterchapel, and the whole body of squires was gathered in the armory waitingfor the orders of the day and the calling of the roll of those chosenfor household duty. Myles was sitting on a bench along the wall, talkingand jesting with some who stood by, when of a sudden his heart gave agreat leap within him.It was Walter Blunt. He came walking in at the door as if nothing hadpassed, and at his unexpected coming the hubbub of talk and laughterwas suddenly checked. Even Myles stopped in his speech for a moment, andthen continued with a beating heart and a carelessness of manner thatwas altogether assumed. In his hand Blunt carried the house orders forthe day, and without seeming to notice Myles, he opened it and read thelist of those called upon for household service.Myles had risen, and was now standing listening with the others. WhenBlunt had ended reading the list of names, he rolled up the parchment,and thrust it into his belt; then swinging suddenly on his heel, hestrode straight up to Myles, facing him front to front. A moment or twoof deep silence followed; not a sound broke the stillness. When Bluntspoke every one in the armory heard his words.""Sirrah!"" said he, ""thou didst put foul shame upon me some time sin.Never will I forget or forgive that offence, and will have a reckoningwith thee right soon that thou wilt not forget to the last day of thylife.""When Myles had seen his enemy turn upon him, he did not know at firstwhat to expect; he would not have been surprised had they come to blowsthere and then, and he held himself prepared for any event. He facedthe other pluckily enough and without flinching, and spoke up boldly inanswer. ""So be it, Walter Blunt; I fear thee not in whatever way thoumayst encounter me.""""Dost thou not?"" said Blunt. ""By\'r Lady, thou\'lt have cause to fear meere I am through with thee."" He smiled a baleful, lingering smile, andthen turned slowly and walked away.""What thinkest thou, Myles?"" said Gascoyne, as the two left the armorytogether.""I think naught,"" said Myles gruffly. ""He will not dare to touch meto harm me. I fear him not."" Nevertheless, he did not speak the fullfeelings of his heart.""I know not, Myles,"" said Gascoyne, shaking his head doubtfully. ""WalterBlunt is a parlous evil-minded knave, and methinks will do whatever evilhe promiseth.""""I fear him not,"" said Myles again; but his heart foreboded trouble.The coming of the head squire made a very great change in the conditionof affairs. Even before that coming the bachelors had somewhat recoveredfrom their demoralization, and now again they began to pluck up theirconfidence and to order the younger squires and pages upon this personalservice or upon that.""See ye not,"" said Myles one day, when the Knights of the Rose weregathered in the Brutus Tower--""see ye not that they grow as bad as ever?An we put not a stop to this overmastery now, it will never stop.""""Best let it be, Myles,"" said Wilkes. ""They will kill thee an thou ceasenot troubling them. Thou hast bred mischief enow for thyself already.""""No matter for that,"" said Myles; ""it is not to be borne that they orderothers of us about as they do. I mean to speak to them to-night, andtell them it shall not be.""He was as good as his word. That night, as the youngsters were shoutingand romping and skylarking, as they always did before turning in, hestood upon his cot and shouted: ""Silence! List to me a little!"" Andthen, in the hush that followed--""I want those bachelors to hear this:that we squires serve them no longer, and if they would ha\' some to waitupon them, they must get them otherwheres than here. There be twenty ofus to stand against them and haply more, and we mean that they shall ha\'service of us no more.""Then he jumped down again from his elevated stand, and an uproar ofconfusion instantly filled the place. What was the effect of his wordsupon the bachelors he could not see. What was the result he was not slowin discovering.The next day Myles and Gascoyne were throwing their daggers for awager at a wooden target against the wall back of the armorer\'s smithy.Wilkes, Gosse, and one or two others of the squires were sitting ona bench looking on, and now and then applauding a more than usuallywell-aimed cast of the knife. Suddenly that impish little page spoken ofbefore, Robin Ingoldsby, thrust his shock head around the corner ofthe smithy, and said: ""Ho, Falworth! Blunt is going to serve thee outto-day, and I myself heard him say so. He says he is going to slit thineears."" And then he was gone as suddenly as he had appeared.Myles darted after him, caught him midway in the quadrangle, and broughthim back by the scuff of the neck, squalling and struggling.""There!"" said he, still panting from the chase and seating the boy by nomeans gently upon the bench beside Wilkes. ""Sit thou there, thou imp ofevil! And now tell me what thou didst mean by thy words anon--an thoustop not thine outcry, I will cut thy throat for thee,"" and he made aferocious gesture with his dagger.It was by no means easy to worm the story from the mischievous littlemonkey; he knew Myles too well to be in the least afraid of his threats.But at last, by dint of bribing and coaxing, Myles and his friendsmanaged to get at the facts. The youngster had been sent to clean theriding-boots of one of the bachelors, instead of which he had lolledidly on a cot in the dormitory, until he had at last fallen asleep. Hehad been awakened by the opening of the dormitory door and by the soundof voices--among them was that of his taskmaster. Fearing punishment forhis neglected duty, he had slipped out of the cot, and hidden himselfbeneath it.Those who had entered were Walter Blunt and three of the olderbachelors. Blunt\'s companions were trying to persuade him againstsomething, but without avail. It was--Myles\'s heart thrilled and hisblood boiled--to lie in wait for him, to overpower him by numbers,and to mutilate him by slitting his ears--a disgraceful punishmentadministered, as a rule, only for thieving and poaching.""He would not dare to do such a thing!"" cried Myles, with heaving breastand flashing eyes.""Aye, but he would,"" said Gascoyne. ""His father, Lord Reginald Blunt,is a great man over Nottingham way, and my Lord would not dare to punishhim even for such a matter as that. But tell me, Robin Ingoldsby, dostknow aught more of this matter? Prithee tell it me, Robin. Where do theypropose to lie in wait for Falworth?""""In the gate-way of the Buttery Court, so as to catch him when he passesby to the armory,"" answered the boy.""Are they there now?"" said Wilkes.""Aye, nine of them,"" said Robin. ""I heard Blunt tell Mowbray to go andgather the others. He heard thee tell Gosse, Falworth, that thou wertgoing thither for thy arbalist this morn to shoot at the rooks withal.""""That will do, Robin,"" said Myles. ""Thou mayst go.""And therewith the little imp scurried off, pulling the lobes of his earssuggestively as he darted around the corner.The others looked at one another for a while in silence.""So, comrades,"" said Myles at last, ""what shall we do now?""""Go, and tell Sir James,"" said Gascoyne, promptly.""Nay,"" said Myles, ""I take no such coward\'s part as that. I say an theyhunger to fight, give them their stomachful.""The others were very reluctant for such extreme measures, but Myles, asusual, carried his way, and so a pitched battle was decided upon. It wasGascoyne who suggested the plan which they afterwards followed.Then Wilkes started away to gather together those of the Knights of theRose not upon household duty, and Myles, with the others, went to thearmor smith to have him make for them a set of knives with which to meettheir enemies--knives with blades a foot long, pointed and double-edged.The smith, leaning with his hammer upon the anvil, listened to them asthey described the weapons.""Nay, nay, Master Myles,"" said he, when Myles had ended by telling theuse to which he intended putting them. ""Thou art going all wrong in thismatter. With such blades, ere this battle is ended, some one would beslain, and so murder done. Then the family of him who was killed wouldhaply have ye cited, and mayhap it might e\'en come to the hanging, forsome of they boys ha\' great folkeys behind them. Go ye to Tom Fletcher,Master Myles, and buy of him good yew staves, such as one might break ahead withal, and with them, gin ye keep your wits, ye may hold your ownagainst knives or short swords. I tell thee, e\'en though my trade bemaking of blades, rather would I ha\' a good stout cudgel in my hand thanthe best dagger that ever was forged.""Myles stood thoughtfully for a moment or two; then, looking up,""Methinks thou speaketh truly, Robin,"" said he; ""and it were ill done tohave blood upon our hands.""']"
82,16,Chapter 16,"['15From the long, narrow stone-paved Armory Court, and connecting it withthe inner Buttery Court, ran a narrow arched passage-way, in which wasa picket-gate, closed at night and locked from within. It was in thisarched passage-way that, according to little Robert Ingoldsby\'s report,the bachelors were lying in wait for Myles. Gascoyne\'s plan was thatMyles should enter the court alone, the Knights of the Rose lyingambushed behind the angle of the armory building until the bachelorsshould show themselves.It was not without trepidation that Myles walked alone into the court,which happened then to be silent and empty. His heart beat more quicklythan it was wont, and he gripped his cudgel behind his back, lookingsharply this way and that, so as not to be taken unawares by a flankmovement of his enemies. Midway in the court he stopped and hesitatedfor a moment; then he turned as though to enter the armory. The nextmoment he saw the bachelors come pouring out from the archway.Instantly he turned and rushed back towards where his friends layhidden, shouting: ""To the rescue! To the rescue!""""Stone him!"" roared Blunt. ""The villain escapes!""He stopped and picked up a cobble-stone as he spoke, flinging it afterhis escaping prey. It narrowly missed Myles\'s head; had it struck him,there might have been no more of this story to tell.""To the rescue! To the rescue!"" shouted Myles\'s friends in answer, andthe next moment he was surrounded by them. Then he turned, and swinginghis cudgel, rushed back upon his foes.The bachelors stopped short at the unexpected sight of the lads withtheir cudgels. For a moment they rallied and drew their knives; thenthey turned and fled towards their former place of hiding.One of them turned for a moment, and flung his knife at Myles with adeadly aim; but Myles, quick as a cat, ducked his body, and the weaponflew clattering across the stony court. Then he who had flung it turnedagain to fly, but in his attempt he had delayed one instant too long.Myles reached him with a long-arm stroke of his cudgel just as heentered the passage-way, knocking him over like a bottle, stunned andsenseless.The next moment the picket-gate was banged in their faces and the boltshot in the staples, and the Knights of the Rose were left shouting andbattering with their cudgels against the palings.By this time the uproar of fight had aroused those in the rooms andoffices fronting upon the Armory Court; heads were thrust from many ofthe windows with the eager interest that a fight always evokes.""Beware!"" shouted Myles. ""Here they come again!"" He bore back towardsthe entrance of the alley-way as he spoke, those behind him scatteringto right and left, for the bachelors had rallied, and were coming againto the attack, shouting.They were not a moment too soon in this retreat, either, for the nextinstant the pickets flew open, and a volley of stones flew after theretreating Knights of the Rose. One smote Wilkes upon the head,knocking him down headlong. Another struck Myles upon his left shoulder,benumbing his arm from the finger-tips to the armpit, so that he thoughtat first the limb was broken.""Get ye behind the buttresses!"" shouted those who looked down upon thefight from the windows--""get ye behind the buttresses!"" And in answerthe lads, scattering like a newly-flushed covey of partridges, fledto and crouched in the sheltering angles of masonry to escape from theflying stones.And now followed a lull in the battle, the bachelors fearing to leavethe protection of the arched passage-way lest their retreat should becut off, and the Knights of the Rose not daring to quit the shelter ofthe buttresses and angles of the wall lest they should be knocked downby the stones.The bachelor whom Myles had struck down with his cudgel was sitting uprubbing the back of his head, and Wilkes had gathered his wits enough tocrawl to the shelter of the nearest buttress. Myles, peeping around thecorner behind which he stood, could see that the bachelors were gatheredinto a little group consulting together. Suddenly it broke asunder, andBlunt turned around.""Ho, Falworth!"" he cried. ""Wilt thou hold truce whiles we parley withye?""""Aye,"" answered Myles.""Wilt thou give me thine honor that ye will hold your hands from harmingus whiles we talk together?""""Yea,"" said Myles, ""I will pledge thee mine honor.""""I accept thy pledge. See! here we throw aside our stones and laydown our knives. Lay ye by your clubs, and meet us in parley at thehorse-block yonder.""""So be it,"" said Myles, and thereupon, standing his cudgel in the angleof the wall, he stepped boldly out into the open court-yard. Those ofhis party came scatteringly from right and left, gathering about him;and the bachelors advanced in a body, led by the head squire.""Now what is it thou wouldst have, Walter Blunt?"" said Myles, when bothparties had met at the horse-block.""It is to say this to thee, Myles Falworth,"" said the other. ""One time,not long sin, thou didst challenge me to meet thee hand to hand in thedormitory. Then thou didst put a vile affront upon me, for the which Iha\' brought on this battle to-day, for I knew not then that thou wertgoing to try thy peasant tricks of wrestling, and so, without guardingmyself, I met thee as thou didst desire.""""But thou hadst thy knife, and would have stabbed him couldst thou ha\'done so,"" said Gascoyne.""Thou liest!"" said Blunt. ""I had no knife."" And then, without givingtime to answer, ""Thou canst not deny that I met thee then at thybidding, canst thou, Falworth?""""Nay,"" said Myles, ""nor haply canst thou deny it either."" And at thiscovert reminder of his defeat Myles\'s followers laughed scoffingly andBlunt bit his lip.""Thou hast said it,"" said he. ""Then sin. I met thee at thy bidding,I dare to thee to meet me now at mine, and to fight this battle outbetween our two selves, with sword and buckler and bascinet as gentlesshould, and not in a wrestling match like two country hodges.""""Thou art a coward caitiff, Walter Blunt!"" burst out Wilkes, who stoodby with a swelling lump upon his head, already as big as a walnut. ""Wellthou knowest that Falworth is no match for thee at broadsword play. Ishe not four years younger than thou, and hast thou not had three timesthe practice in arms that he hath had? I say thou art a coward to seekto fight with cutting weapons.""Blunt made no answer to Wilkes\'s speech, but gazed steadfastly at Myles,with a scornful smile curling the corners of his lips. Myles stoodlooking upon the ground without once lifting his eyes, not knowing whatto answer, for he was well aware that he was no match for Blunt with thebroadsword.""Thou art afraid to fight me, Myles Falworth,"" said Blunt, tauntingly,and the bachelors gave a jeering laugh in echo.Then Myles looked up, and I cannot say that his face was not a triflewhiter than usual. ""Nay,"" said he, ""I am not afraid, and I will fightthee, Blunt.""""So be it,"" said Blunt. ""Then let us go at it straightway in the armoryyonder, for they be at dinner in the Great Hall, and just now therebe\'st no one by to stay us.""""Thou shalt not fight him, Myles!"" burst out Gascoyne. ""He will murtherthee! Thou shalt not fight him, I say!""Myles turned away without answering him.""What is to do?"" called one of those who were still looking out of thewindows as the crowd of boys passed beneath.""Blunt and Falworth are going to fight it out hand to hand in thearmory,"" answered one of the bachelors, looking up.The brawling of the squires was a jest to all the adjoining part of thehouse. So the heads were withdrawn again, some laughing at the ""sparringof the cockerels.""But it was no jesting matter to poor Myles.']"
82,17,Chapter 17,"['16I have no intention to describe the fight between Myles Falworth andWalter Blunt. Fisticuffs of nowadays are brutal and debasing enough, buta fight with a sharp-edged broadsword was not only brutal and debasing,but cruel and bloody as well.From the very first of the fight Myles Falworth was palpably andobviously overmatched. After fifteen minutes had passed, Blunt stoodhale and sound as at first; but poor Myles had more than one red stainof warm blood upon doublet and hose, and more than one bandage had beenwrapped by Gascoyne and Wilkes about sore wounds.He had received no serious injury as yet, for not only was his bodyprotected by a buckler, or small oblong shield, which he carried uponhis left arm, and his head by a bascinet, or light helmet of steel, butperhaps, after all, Blunt was not over-anxious to do him any dangerousharm. Nevertheless, there could be but one opinion as to how the fighttended, and Myles\'s friends were gloomy and downcast; the bachelorsproportionately exultant, shouting with laughter, and taunting Myles atevery unsuccessful stroke.Once, as he drew back panting, leaning upon Gascoyne\'s shoulder, thefaithful friend whispered, with trembling lips: ""Oh, dear Myles, carryit no further. Thou hurtest him not, and he will slay thee ere he havedone with thee.""Thereupon Blunt, who caught the drift of the speech, put in a word.""Thou art sore hurt, Myles Falworth,"" said he, ""and I would do thee nogrievous harm. Yield thee and own thyself beaten, and I will forgivethee. Thou hast fought a good fight, and there is no shame in yieldingnow.""""Never!"" cried Myles, hoarsely--""never will I yield me! Thou mayst slayme, Walter Blunt, and I reck not if thou dost do so, but never else wiltthou conquer me.""There was a tone of desperation in his voice that made all look serious.""Nay,"" said Blunt; ""I will fight thee no more, Myles Falworth; thou hasthad enough.""""By heavens!"" cried Myles, grinding his teeth, ""thou shalt fight me,thou coward! Thou hast brought this fight upon us, and either thou or Iget our quittance here. Let go, Gascoyne!"" he cried, shaking loose hisfriend\'s hold; ""I tell thee he shall fight me!""From that moment Blunt began to lose his head. No doubt he had notthought of such a serious fight as this when he had given his challenge,and there was a savage bull-dog tenacity about Myles that could not buthave had a somewhat demoralizing effect upon him.A few blows were given and taken, and then Myles\'s friends gave a shout.Blunt drew back, and placed his hand to his shoulder. When he drewit away again it was stained with red, and another red stain grew andspread rapidly down the sleeve of his jacket. He stared at his hand fora moment with a half-dazed look, and then glanced quickly to right andleft.""I will fight no more,"" said he, sullenly.""Then yield thee!"" cried Myles, exultantly.The triumphant shouts of the Knights of the Rose stung Blunt like alash, and the battle began again. Perhaps some of the older lads were ofa mind to interfere at this point, certainly some looked very serious,but before they interposed, the fight was ended.Blunt, grinding his teeth, struck one undercut at his opponent--thesame undercut that Myles had that time struck at Sir James Lee at theknight\'s bidding when he first practised at the Devlen pels. Mylesmet the blow as Sir James had met the blow that he had given, and thenstruck in return as Sir James had struck--full and true. The bascinetthat Blunt wore glanced the blow partly, but not entirely. Myles felthis sword bite through the light steel cap, and Blunt dropped his ownblade clattering upon the floor. It was all over in an instant, but inthat instant what he saw was stamped upon Myles\'s mind with an indelibleimprint. He saw the young man stagger backward; he saw the eyes rollupward; and a red streak shoot out from under the cap and run downacross the cheek.Blunt reeled half around, and then fell prostrate upon his face; andMyles stood staring at him with the delirious turmoil of his battledissolving rapidly into a dumb fear at that which he had done.Once again he had won the victory--but what a victory! ""Is he dead?"" hewhispered to Gascoyne.""I know not,"" said Gascoyne, with a very pale face. ""But come away,Myles."" And he led his friend out of the room.Some little while later one of the bachelors came to the dormitory whereMyles, his wounds smarting and aching and throbbing, lay stretched uponhis cot, and with a very serious face bade him to go presently to SirJames, who had just come from dinner, and was then in his office.By this time Myles knew that he had not slain his enemy, and his heartwas light in spite of the coming interview. There was no one inthe office but Sir James and himself, and Myles, without concealinganything, told, point by point, the whole trouble. Sir James sat lookingsteadily at him for a while after he had ended.""Never,"" said he, presently, ""did I know any one of ye squires, in allthe time that I have been here, get himself into so many broils as thou,Myles Falworth. Belike thou sought to take this lad\'s life.""""Nay,"" said Myles, earnestly; ""God forbid!""""Ne\'theless,"" said Sir James, ""thou fetched him a main shrewd blow; andit is by good hap, and no fault of thine, that he will live to do moremischief yet. This is thy second venture at him; the third time, haply,thou wilt end him for good."" Then suddenly assuming his grimmest andsternest manner: ""Now, sirrah, do I put a stop to this, and no moreshall ye fight with edged tools. Get thee to the dormitory, and abidethere a full week without coming forth. Michael shall bring thee breadand water twice a day for that time. That is all the food thou shalthave, and we will see if that fare will not cool thy hot humors withal.""Myles had expected a punishment so much more severe than that which wasthus meted to him, that in the sudden relief he broke into a convulsivelaugh, and then, with a hasty sweep, wiped a brimming moisture from hiseyes.Sir James looked keenly at him for a moment. ""Thou art white i\' theface,"" said he. ""Art thou wounded very sorely?""""Nay"" said Myles, ""it is not much; but I be sick in my stomach.""""Aye, aye,"" said Sir James; ""I know that feeling well. It is thusthat one always feeleth in coming out from a sore battle when one hathsuffered wounds and lost blood. An thou wouldst keep thyself hale, keepthyself from needless fighting. Now go thou to the dormitory, and, as Isaid, come thou not forth again for a week. Stay, sirrah!"" he added; ""Iwill send Georgebarber to thee to look to thy sores. Green wounds arebest drawn and salved ere they grow cold.""I wonder what Myles would have thought had he known that so soon ashe had left the office, Sir James had gone straight to the Earl andrecounted the whole matter to him, with a deal of dry gusto, and thatthe Earl listened laughing.""Aye,"" said he, when Sir James had done, ""the boy hath mettle, sure.Nevertheless, we must transplant this fellow Blunt to the office ofgentleman-in-waiting. He must be old enough now, and gin he stayeth inhis present place, either he will do the boy a harm, or the boy will dohim a harm.""So Blunt never came again to trouble the squires\' quarters; andthereafter the youngsters rendered no more service to the elders.Myles\'s first great fight in life was won.']"
82,18,Chapter 18,"['17The summer passed away, and the bleak fall came. Myles had long sinceaccepted his position as one set apart from the others of his kind, andhad resigned himself to the evident fact that he was never to servein the household in waiting upon the Earl. I cannot say that it nevertroubled him, but in time there came a compensation of which I shallhave presently to speak.And then he had so much the more time to himself. The other lads weresometimes occupied by their household duties when sports were afootin which they would liked to have taken part. Myles was always freeto enter into any matter of the kind after his daily exercise had beenperformed at the pels, the butts, or the tilting-court.But even though he was never called to do service in ""my Lord\'s house,""he was not long in gaining a sort of second-hand knowledge of all thefamily. My Lady, a thin, sallow, faded dame, not yet past middle age,but looking ten years older. The Lady Anne, the daughter of the house;a tall, thin, dark-eyed, dark-haired, handsome young dame of twenty ortwenty-one years of age, hawk-nosed like her father, and silent, proud,and haughty, Myles heard the squires say. Lady Alice, the Earl ofMackworth\'s niece and ward, a great heiress in her own right, astrikingly pretty black-eyed girl of fourteen or fifteen.These composed the Earl\'s personal family; but besides them was LordGeorge Beaumont, his Earl\'s brother, and him Myles soon came to knowbetter than any of the chief people of the castle excepting Sir JamesLee.For since Myles\'s great battle in the armory, Lord George had taken alaughing sort of liking to the lad, encouraging him at times to talk ofhis adventures, and of his hopes and aspirations.Perhaps the Earl\'s younger brother--who was himself somewhat a soldierof fortune, having fought in Spain, France, and Germany--felt a certainkinship in spirit with the adventurous youngster who had his unfriendedway to make in the world. However that might have been, Lord George wasvery kind and friendly to the lad, and the willing service that Mylesrendered him reconciled him not a little to the Earl\'s obvious neglect.Besides these of the more immediate family of the Earl were a numberof knights, ladies, and gentlemen, some of them cadets, some of themretainers, of the house of Beaumont, for the princely nobles of thosedays lived in state little less royal than royalty itself.Most of the knights and gentlemen Myles soon came to know by sight,meeting them in Lord George\'s apartments in the south wing of the greathouse, and some of them, following the lead of Lord George, singled himout for friendly notice, giving him a nod or a word in passing.Every season has its pleasures for boys, and the constant change thatthey bring is one of the greatest delights of boyhood\'s days.All of us, as we grow older, have in our memory pictures of by-gonetimes that are somehow more than usually vivid, the colors of some notblurring by time as others do. One of which, in remembering, alwaysfilled Myles\'s heart in after-years with an indefinable pleasure, wasthe recollection of standing with others of his fellow squires in thecrisp brown autumn grass of the paddock, and shooting with the long-bowat wildfowl, which, when the east wind was straining, flew low overheadto pitch to the lake in the forbidden precincts of the deer park beyondthe brow of the hill. More than once a brace or two of these wildfowl,shot in their southward flight by the lads and cooked by fat,good-natured Mother Joan, graced the rude mess-table of the squires inthe long hall, and even the toughest and fishiest drake, so the fruitof their skill, had a savor that, somehow or other, the daintiest farelacked in after-years.Then fall passed and winter came, bleak, cold, and dreary--not winter aswe know it nowadays, with warm fires and bright lights to make the longnights sweet and cheerful with comfort, but winter with all its grimnessand sternness. In the great cold stone-walled castles of those days theonly fire and almost the only light were those from the huge blazinglogs that roared and crackled in the great open stone fireplace, aroundwhich the folks gathered, sheltering their faces as best they could fromthe scorching heat, and cloaking their shoulders from the biting cold,for at the farther end of the room, where giant shadows swayed andbowed and danced huge and black against the high walls, the white frostglistened in the moonlight on the stone pavements, and the breath wentup like smoke.In those days were no books to read, but at the best only rude storiesand jests, recited by some strolling mummer or minstrel to the listeningcircle, gathered around the blaze and welcoming the coarse, gross jests,and coarser, grosser songs with roars of boisterous laughter.Yet bleak and dreary as was the winter in those days, and cold andbiting as was the frost in the cheerless, windy halls and corridors ofthe castle, it was not without its joys to the young lads; for then, asnow, boys could find pleasure even in slushy weather, when the soddensnow is fit for nothing but to make snowballs of.Thrice that bitter winter the moat was frozen over, and the lads, makingthemselves skates of marrow-bones, which they bought from the hall cookat a groat a pair, went skimming over the smooth surface, red-checkedand shouting, while the crows and the jackdaws looked down at them fromthe top of the bleak gray walls.Then at Yule-tide, which was somewhat of a rude semblance to the MerryChristmas season of our day, a great feast was held in the hall, and allthe castle folk were fed in the presence of the Earl and the Countess.Oxen and sheep were roasted whole; huge suet puddings, made of barleymeal sweetened with honey and stuffed with plums, were boiled in greatcaldrons in the open courtyard; whole barrels of ale and malmsey werebroached, and all the folk, gentle and simple, were bidden to the feast.Afterwards the minstrels danced and played a rude play, and in theevening a miracle show was performed on a raised platform in the northhall.For a week afterwards the castle was fed upon the remains of the goodthings left from that great feast, until everyone grew to loathe finevictuals, and longed for honest beef and mustard again.Then at last in that constant change the winter was gone, and even thelads who had enjoyed its passing were glad when the winds blew warm oncemore, and the grass showed green in sunny places, and the leader of thewild-fowl blew his horn, as they who in the fall had flown to the southflew, arrow-like, northward again; when the buds swelled and the leavesburst forth once more, and crocuses and then daffodils gleamed in thegreen grass, like sparks and flames of gold.With the spring came the out-door sports of the season; among othersthat of ball--for boys were boys, and played at ball even in thosefaraway days--a game called trap-ball. Even yet in some parts of Englandit is played just as it was in Myles Falworth\'s day, and enjoyed just asMyles and his friends enjoyed it.So now that the sun was warm and the weather pleasant the game oftrap-ball was in full swing every afternoon, the play-ground being anopen space between the wall that surrounded the castle grounds and thatof the privy garden--the pleasance in which the ladies of the Earl\'sfamily took the air every day, and upon which their apartments opened.Now one fine breezy afternoon, when the lads were shouting and playingat this, then their favorite game, Myles himself was at the trapbarehanded and barearmed. The wind was blowing from behind him, and,aided perhaps by it, he had already struck three of four balls nearlythe whole length of the court--an unusual distance--and several of thelads had gone back almost as far as the wall of the privy garden tocatch any ball that might chance to fly as far as that. Then once moreMyles struck, throwing all his strength into the blow. The ball shot upinto the air, and when it fell, it was to drop within the privy garden.The shouts of the young players were instantly stilled, and Gascoyne,who stood nearest Myles, thrust his hands into his belt, giving a longshrill whistle.""This time thou hast struck us all out, Myles,"" said he. ""There be nomore play for us until we get another ball.""The outfielders came slowly trooping in until they had gathered in alittle circle around Myles.""I could not help it,"" said Myles, in answer to their grumbling. ""Howknew I the ball would fly so far? But if I ha\' lost the ball, I can getit again. I will climb the wall for it.""""Thou shalt do naught of the kind, Myles,"" said Gascoyne, hastily.""Thou art as mad as a March hare to think of such a venture! Wouldst getthyself shot with a bolt betwixt the ribs, like poor Diccon Cook?""Of all places about the castle the privy garden was perhaps the mostsacred. It was a small plot of ground, only a few rods long and wide,and was kept absolutely private for the use of the Countess and herfamily. Only a little while before Myles had first come to Devlen,one of the cook\'s men had been found climbing the wall, whereupon thesoldier who saw him shot him with his cross bow. The poor fellow droppedfrom the wall into the garden, and when they found him, he still helda bunch of flowers in his hand, which he had perhaps been gathering forhis sweetheart.Had Myles seen him carried on a litter to the infirmary as Gascoyneand some of the others had done, he might have thought twice beforeventuring to enter the ladies\' private garden. As it was, he only shookhis stubborn head, and said again, ""I will climb the wall and fetch it.""Now at the lower extremity of the court, and about twelve or fifteenfeet distant from the garden wall, there grew a pear-tree, some of thebranches of which overhung into the garden beyond. So, first making surethat no one was looking that way, and bidding the others keep a sharplookout, Myles shinned up this tree, and choosing one of the thickerlimbs, climbed out upon it for some little distance. Then lowering hisbody, he hung at arm\'s-length, the branch bending with his weight, andslowly let himself down hand under hand, until at last he hung directlyover the top of the wall, and perhaps a foot above it. Below him hecould see the leafy top of an arbor covered with a thick growth ofclematis, and even as he hung there he noticed the broad smoothwalks, the grassy terrace in front of the Countess\'s apartments in thedistance, the quaint flower-beds, the yew-trees trimmed into odd shapes,and even the deaf old gardener working bare-armed in the sunlight at aflower-bed in the far corner by the tool-house.The top of the wall was pointed like a house roof, and immediately belowhim was covered by a thick growth of green moss, and it flashed throughhis mind as he hung there that maybe it would offer a very slipperyfoothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top. But it wastoo late to draw back now.Bracing himself for a moment, he loosed his hold upon the limb above.The branch flew back with a rush, and he dropped, striving to grasp thesloping angle with his feet. Instantly the treacherous slippery mossslid away from beneath him; he made a vain clutch at the wall, hisfingers sliding over the cold stones, then, with a sharp exclamation,down he pitched bodily into the garden beneath! A thousand thoughtsflew through his brain like a cloud of flies, and then a leafy greennessseemed to strike up against him. A splintering crash sounded in hisears as the lattice top of the arbor broke under him, and with one finalclutch at the empty air he fell heavily upon the ground beneath.He heard a shrill scream that seemed to find an instant echo; even ashe fell he had a vision of faces and bright colors, and when he sat up,dazed and bewildered, he found himself face to face with the Lady Anne,the daughter of the house, and her cousin, the Lady Alice, who clutchingone another tightly, stood staring at him with wide scared eyes.']"
82,19,Chapter 19,"['18For a little time there was a pause of deep silence, during which thefluttering leaves came drifting down from the broken arbor above.It was the Lady Anne who first spoke. ""Who art thou, and whence comestthou?"" said she, tremulously.Then Myles gathered himself up sheepishly. ""My name is Myles Falworth,""said he, ""and I am one of the squires of the body.""""Oh! aye!"" said the Lady Alice, suddenly. ""Me thought I knew thy face.Art thou not the young man that I have seen in Lord George\'s train?""""Yes, lady,"" said Myles, wrapping and twining a piece of the broken vinein and out among his fingers. ""Lord George hath often had me of lateabout his person.""""And what dost thou do here, sirrah?"" said Lady Anne, angrily. ""Howdarest thou come so into our garden?""""I meant not to come as I did,"" said Myles, clumsily, and with a facehot and red. ""But I slipped over the top of the wall and fell hastilyinto the garden. Truly, lady, I meant ye no harm or fright thereby.""He looked so drolly abashed as he stood before them, with his clothestorn and soiled from the fall, his face red, and his eyes downcast, allthe while industriously twisting the piece of clematis in and around hisfingers, that Lady Anne\'s half-frightened anger could not last. She andher cousin exchanged glances, and smiled at one another.""But,"" said she at last, trying to draw her pretty brows together into afrown, ""tell me; why didst thou seek to climb the wall?""""I came to seek a ball,"" said Myles, ""which I struck over hither fromthe court beyond.""""And wouldst thou come into our privy garden for no better reason thanto find a ball?"" said the young lady.""Nay,"" said Myles; ""it was not so much to find the ball, but, in goodsooth, I did truly strike it harder than need be, and so, gin I lost theball, I could do no less than come and find it again, else our sport isdone for the day. So it was I came hither.""The two young ladies had by now recovered from their fright. The LadyAnne slyly nudged her cousin with her elbow, and the younger could notsuppress a half-nervous laugh. Myles heard it, and felt his face growhotter and redder than ever.""Nay,"" said Lady Anne, ""I do believe Master Giles--""""My name be\'st Myles,"" corrected Myles.""Very well, then, Master Myles, I say I do believe that thou meanestno harm in coming hither; ne\'theless it was ill of thee so to do. An myfather should find thee here, he would have thee shrewdly punished forsuch trespassing. Dost thou not know that no one is permitted to enterthis place--no, not even my uncle George? One fellow who came hither tosteal apples once had his ears shaven close to his head, and not morethan a year ago one of the cook\'s men who climbed the wall early onemorning was shot by the watchman.""""Aye,"" said Myles, ""I knew of him who was shot, and it did go somewhatagainst my stomach to venture, knowing what had happed to him.Ne\'theless, an I gat not the ball, how were we to play more to-day atthe trap?""""Marry, thou art a bold fellow, I do believe me,"" said the young lady,""and sin thou hast come in the face of such peril to get thy ball, thoushalt not go away empty. Whither didst thou strike it?""""Over yonder by the cherry-tree,"" said Myles, jerking his head in thatdirection. ""An I may go get it, I will trouble ye no more."" As he spokehe made a motion to leave them.""Stay!"" said the Lady Anne, hastily; ""remain where thou art. An thoucross the open, some one may haply see thee from the house, and willgive the alarm, and thou wilt be lost. I will go get thy ball.""And so she left Myles and her cousin, crossing the little plots of grassand skirting the rosebushes to the cherry-tree.When Myles found himself alone with Lady Alice, he knew not where tolook or what to do, but twisted the piece of clematis which he stillheld in and out more industriously than ever.Lady Alice watched him with dancing eyes for a little while. ""Haply thouwilt spoil that poor vine,"" said she by-and-by, breaking the silence andlaughing, then turning suddenly serious again. ""Didst thou hurt thyselfby thy fall?""""Nay,"" said Myles, looking up, ""such a fall as that was no great matter.Many and many a time I have had worse.""""Hast thou so?"" said the Lady Alice. ""Thou didst fright me parlously,and my coz likewise.""Myles hesitated for a moment, and then blurted out, ""Thereat I grieve,for thee I would not fright for all the world.""The young lady laughed and blushed. ""All the world is a great matter,""said she.""Yea,"" said he, ""it is a great matter; but it is a greater matter tofright thee, and so I would not do it for that, and more.""The young lady laughed again, but she did not say anything further, anda space of silence fell so long that by-and-by she forced herself tosay, ""My cousin findeth not the ball presently.""""Nay,"" said Myles, briefly, and then again neither spoke, untilby-and-by the Lady Anne came, bringing the ball. Myles felt a greatsense of relief at that coming, and yet was somehow sorry. Then he tookthe ball, and knew enough to bow his acknowledgment in a manner neitherill nor awkward.""Didst thou hurt thyself?"" asked Lady Anne.""Nay,"" said Myles, giving himself a shake; ""seest thou not I be whole,limb and bone? Nay, I have had shrewdly worse falls than that. Once Ifell out of an oak-tree down by the river and upon a root, and bethoughtme I did break a rib or more. And then one time when I was a boy inCrosbey-Dale--that was where I lived before I came hither--I did catchme hold of the blade of the windmill, thinking it was moving slowly, andthat I would have a ride i\' th\' air, and so was like to have had a fallten thousand times worse than this.""""Oh, tell us more of that!"" said the Lady Anne, eagerly. ""I did neverhear of such an adventure as that. Come, coz, and sit down here upon thebench, and let us have him tell us all of that happening.""Now the lads upon the other side of the wall had been whistlingfurtively for some time, not knowing whether Myles had broken his neckor had come off scot-free from his fall. ""I would like right well tostay with ye,"" said he, irresolutely, ""and would gladly tell ye that andmore an ye would have me to do so; but hear ye not my friends call mefrom beyond? Mayhap they think I break my back, and are calling to seewhether I be alive or no. An I might whistle them answer and toss methis ball to them, all would then be well, and they would know that Iwas not hurt, and so, haply, would go away.""""Then answer them,"" said the Lady Anne, ""and tell us of that thing thouspokest of anon--how thou tookest a ride upon the windmill. We youngladies do hear little of such matters, not being allowed to talk withlads. All that we hear of perils are of knights and ladies and jousting,and such like. It would pleasure us right well to have thee tell of thyadventures.""So Myles tossed back the ball, and whistled in answer to his friends.Then he told the two young ladies not only of his adventure upon thewindmill, but also of other boyish escapades, and told them well, witha straightforward smack and vigor, for he enjoyed adventure and loved totalk of it. In a little while he had regained his ease; his shyness andawkwardness left him, and nothing remained but the delightful fact thathe was really and actually talking to two young ladies, and that withjust as much ease and infinitely more pleasure than could be had indiscourse with his fellow-squires. But at last it was time for him togo. ""Marry,"" said he, with a half-sigh, ""methinks I did never ha\' sosweet and pleasant a time in all my life before. Never did I know areal lady to talk with, saving only my mother, and I do tell yeplain methinks I would rather talk with ye than with any he inChristendom--saving, perhaps, only my friend Gascoyne. I would I mightcome hither again.""The honest frankness of his speech was irresistible; the two girlsexchanged glances and then began laughing. ""Truly,"" said Lady Anne, who,as was said before, was some three or four years older than Myles,""thou art a bold lad to ask such a thing. How wouldst thou come hither?Wouldst tumble through our clematis arbor again, as thou didst thisday?""""Nay,"" said Myles, ""I would not do that again, but if ye will bid me doso, I will find the means to come hither.""""Nay,"" said Lady Anne, ""I dare not bid thee do such a foolhardy thing.Nevertheless, if thou hast the courage to come--""""Yea,"" said Myles, eagerly, ""I have the courage.""""Then, if thou hast so, we will be here in the garden on Saturday nextat this hour. I would like right well to hear more of thy adventures.But what didst thou say was thy name? I have forgot it again.""""It is Myles Falworth.""""Then we shall yclep thee Sir Myles, for thou art a soothlyerrant-knight. And stay! Every knight must have a lady to serve. Howwouldst thou like my Cousin Alice here for thy true lady?""""Aye,"" said Myles, eagerly, ""I would like it right well."" And then heblushed fiery red at his boldness.""I want no errant-knight to serve me,"" said the Lady Alice, blushing,in answer. ""Thou dost ill tease me, coz! An thou art so free in choosinghim a lady to serve, thou mayst choose him thyself for thy pains.""""Nay,"" said the Lady Anne, laughing; ""I say thou shalt be his true lady,and he shall be thy true knight. Who knows? Perchance he may serven theein some wondrous adventure, like as Chaucer telleth of. But now, SirErrant-Knight, thou must take thy leave of us, and I must e\'en let theeprivily out by the postern-wicket. And if thou wilt take the risk uponthee and come hither again, prithee be wary in that coming, lest inventuring thou have thine ears clipped in most unknightly fashion.""That evening, as he and Gascoyne sat together on a bench under the treesin the great quadrangle, Myles told of his adventure of the afternoon,and his friend listened with breathless interest.""But, Myles,"" cried Gascoyne, ""did the Lady Anne never once seem proudand unkind?""""Nay,"" said Myles; ""only at first, when she chid me for falling throughthe roof of their arbor. And to think, Francis! Lady Anne herselfbade me hold the Lady Alice as my true lady, and to serve her in allknightliness!"" Then he told his friend that he was going to the privygarden again on the next Saturday, and that the Lady Anne had given himpermission so to do.Gascoyne gave a long, wondering whistle, and then sat quite still,staring into the sky. By-and-by he turned to his friend and said, ""Igive thee my pledge, Myles Falworth, that never in all my life did Ihear of any one that had such marvellous strange happenings befall himas thou.""Whenever the opportunity occurred for sending a letter to Crosbey-Holt,Myles wrote one to his mother; and one can guess how they were treasuredby the good lady, and read over and over again to the blind old Lord ashe sat staring into darkness with his sightless eyes.About the time of this escapade he wrote a letter telling of thosedoings, wherein, after speaking of his misadventure of falling from thewall, and of his acquaintance with the young ladies, he went on to speakof the matter in which he repeated his visits. The letter was wordedin the English of that day--the quaint and crabbed language in whichChaucer wrote. Perhaps few boys could read it nowadays, so, modernizingit somewhat, it ran thus:""And now to let ye weet that thing that followed that happening thatmade me acquaint with they two young Damoiselles. I take me to the southwall of that garden one day four and twenty great spikes, which PeterSmith did forge for me and for which I pay him fivepence, and that allthe money that I had left of my half-year\'s wage, and wot not where Imay get more at these present, withouten I do betake me to Sir James,who, as I did tell ye, hath consented to hold those moneys that PriorEdward gave me till I need them.""Now these same spikes, I say, I take me them down behind the corner ofthe wall, and there drave them betwixt the stones, my very dear comradeand true friend Gascoyne holping me thereto to do. And so come Saturday,I climb me over the wall and to the roof of the tool-house below,seeking a fitting opportunity when I might so do without being in toogreat jeopardy.""Yea; and who should be there but they two ladies, biding my coming,who, seeing me, made as though they had expected me not, and gave megreatest rebuke for adventuring so moughtily. Yet, methinks, were theyright well pleasured that I should so aventure, which indeed I might nototherwise do, seeing as I have telled to thee, that one of them is mineown true lady for to serven, and so was the only way that I might cometo speech with her.""Such was Myles\'s own quaint way of telling how he accomplished his aimof visiting the forbidden garden, and no doubt the smack of adventureand the savor of danger in the undertaking recommended him not a littleto the favor of the young ladies.After this first acquaintance perhaps a month passed, during which Myleshad climbed the wall some half a dozen times (for the Lady Annewould not permit of too frequent visits), and during which the firstacquaintance of the three ripened rapidly to an honest, pleasantfriendship. More than once Myles, when in Lord George\'s train, caughta covert smile or half nod from one or both of the girls, not a littledelightful in its very secret friendliness.']"
82,20,Chapter 20,"['19As was said, perhaps a month passed; then Myles\'s visits came to anabrupt termination, and with it ended, in a certain sense, a chapter ofhis life.One Saturday afternoon he climbed the garden wall, and skirting behinda long row of rosebushes that screened him from the Countess\'s terrace,came to a little summer-house where the two young ladies had appointedto meet him that day.A pleasant half-hour or so was passed, and then it was time for Mylesto go. He lingered for a while before he took his final leave, leaningagainst the door-post, and laughingly telling how he and some of hisbrother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in men\'s clothes, andhad played a trick with it one night upon a watchman against whom theybore a grudge.The young ladies were listening with laughing faces, when suddenly, asMyles looked, he saw the smile vanish from Lady Alice\'s eyes and a wideterror take its place. She gave a half-articulate cry, and rose abruptlyfrom the bench upon which she was sitting.Myles turned sharply, and then his very heart seemed to stand stillwithin him; for there, standing in the broad sunlight without, andglaring in upon the party with baleful eyes, was the Earl of Mackworthhimself.How long was the breathless silence that followed, Myles could nevertell. He knew that the Lady Anne had also risen, and that she and hercousin were standing as still as statues. Presently the Earl pointed tothe house with his staff, and Myles noted stupidly how it trembled inhis hand.""Ye wenches,"" said he at last, in a hard, harsh voice--""ye wenches, whatmeaneth this? Would ye deceive me so, and hold parlance thus secretlywith this fellow? I will settle with him anon. Meantime get yestraightway to the house and to your rooms, and there abide until I giveye leave to come forth again. Go, I say!""""Father,"" said Lady Anne, in a breathless voice--she was as white asdeath, and moistened her lips with her tongue before she spoke--""father,thou wilt not do harm to this young man. Spare him, I do beseech thee,for truly it was I who bade him come hither. I know that he would nothave come but at our bidding.""The Earl stamped his foot upon the gravel. ""Did ye not hear me?"" saidhe, still pointing towards the house with his trembling staff. ""I badeye go to your rooms. I will settle with this fellow, I say, as I deemfitting.""""Father,"" began Lady Anne again; but the Earl made such a savage gesturethat poor Lady Alice uttered a faint shriek, and Lady Anne stoppedabruptly, trembling. Then she turned and passed out the farther door ofthe summerhouse, poor little Lady Alice following, holding her tightby the skirts, and trembling and shuddering as though with a fit of theague.The Earl stood looking grimly after them from under his shaggy eyebrows,until they passed away behind the yew-trees, appeared again upon theterrace behind, entered the open doors of the women\'s house, and weregone. Myles heard their footsteps growing fainter and fainter, but henever raised his eyes. Upon the ground at his feet were four pebbles,and he noticed how they almost made a square, and would do so if hepushed one of them with his toe, and then it seemed strange to him thathe should think of such a little foolish thing at that dreadful time.He knew that the Earl was looking gloomily at him, and that his facemust be very pale. Suddenly Lord Mackworth spoke. ""What hast thou tosay?"" said he, harshly.Then Myles raised his eyes, and the Earl smiled grimly as he looked hisvictim over. ""I have naught to say,"" said the lad, huskily.""Didst thou not hear what my daughter spake but now?"" said the Earl.""She said that thou came not of thy own free-will; what sayst thou tothat, sirrah--is it true?""Myles hesitated for a moment or two; his throat was tight and dry.""Nay,"" said he at last, ""she belieth herself. It was I who first cameinto the garden. I fell by chance from the tree yonder--I was seekinga ball--then I asked those two if I might not come hither again, and sohave done some several times in all. But as for her--nay; it was not ather bidding that I came, but through mine own asking.""The Earl gave a little grunt in his throat. ""And how often hast thoubeen here?"" said he, presently.Myles thought a moment or two. ""This maketh the seventh time,"" said he.Another pause of silence followed, and Myles began to pluck up someheart that maybe all would yet be well. The Earl\'s next speech dashedthat hope into a thousand fragments. ""Well thou knowest,"" said he, ""thatit is forbid for any to come here. Well thou knowest that twice have menbeen punished for this thing that thou hast done, and yet thou camest inspite of all. Now dost thou know what thou wilt suffer?""Myles picked with nervous fingers at a crack in the oaken post againstwhich he leaned. ""Mayhap thou wilt kill me,"" said he at last, in a dull,choking voice.Again the Earl smiled a grim smile. ""Nay,"" said he, ""I would not slaythee, for thou hast gentle blood. But what sayest thou should I shearthine ears from thine head, or perchance have thee scourged in the greatcourt?""The sting of the words sent the blood flying back to Myles\'s face again,and he looked quickly up. ""Nay,"" said he, with a boldness that surprisedhimself; ""thou shalt do no such unlordly thing upon me as that. I be thypeer, sir, in blood; and though thou mayst kill me, thou hast no rightto shame me.""Lord Mackworth bowed with a mocking courtesy. ""Marry!"" said he.""Methought it was one of mine own saucy popinjay squires that I caughtsneaking here and talking to those two foolish young lasses, and lo! itis a young Lord--or mayhap thou art a young Prince--and commandethme that I shall not do this and I shall not do that. I crave yourLordship\'s honorable pardon, if I have said aught that may have galledyou.""The fear Myles had felt was now beginning to dissolve in rising wrath.""Nay,"" said he, stoutly, ""I be no Lord and I be no Prince, but I be asgood as thou. For am I not the son of thy onetime very true comrade andthy kinsman--to wit, the Lord Falworth, whom, as thou knowest, is poorand broken, and blind, and helpless, and outlawed, and banned? Yet,""cried he, grinding his teeth, as the thought of it all rushed in uponhim, ""I would rather be in his place than in yours; for though he beruined, you--""He had just sense enough to stop there.The Earl, gripping his staff behind his back, and with his head a littlebent, was looking keenly at the lad from under his shaggy gray brows.""Well,"" said he, as Myles stopped, ""thou hast gone too far now to drawback. Say thy say to the end. Why wouldst thou rather be in thy father\'sstead than in mine?""Myles did not answer.""Thou shalt finish thy speech, or else show thyself a coward. Though thyfather is ruined, thou didst say I am--what?""Myles keyed himself up to the effort, and then blurted out, ""Thou artattainted with shame.""A long breathless silence followed.""Myles Falworth,"" said the Earl at last (and even in the whirling of hiswits Myles wondered that he had the name so pat)--""Myles Falworth, ofall the bold, mad, hare-brained fools, thou art the most foolish. Howdost thou dare say such words to me? Dost thou not know that thou makestthy coming punishment ten times more bitter by such a speech?""""Aye!"" cried Myles, desperately; ""but what else could I do? An I did notsay the words, thou callest me coward, and coward I am not.""""By \'r Lady!"" said the Earl, ""I do believe thee. Thou art a bold,impudent varlet as ever lived--to beard me so, forsooth! Hark\'ee; thousayst I think naught of mine old comrade. I will show thee that thoudost belie me. I will suffer what thou hast said to me for his sake, andfor his sake will forgive thee thy coming hither--which I would not doin another case to any other man. Now get thee gone straightway, andcome hither no more. Yonder is the postern-gate; mayhap thou knowest theway. But stay! How camest thou hither?""Myles told him of the spikes he had driven in the wall, and the Earllistened, stroking his beard. When the lad had ended, he fixed a sharplook upon him. ""But thou drove not those spikes alone,"" said he; ""whohelped thee do it?""""That I may not tell,"" said Myles, firmly.""So be it,"" said the Earl. ""I will not ask thee to tell his name. Nowget thee gone! And as for those spikes, thou mayst e\'en knock them outof the wall, sin thou drave them in. Play no more pranks an thou wouldstkeep thy skin whole. And now go, I say!""Myles needed no further bidding, but turned and left the Earl withoutanother word. As he went out the postern-gate he looked over hisshoulder, and saw the tall figure, in its long fur-trimmed gown, stillstanding in the middle of the path, looking after him from under theshaggy eyebrows.As he ran across the quadrangle, his heart still fluttering in hisbreast, he muttered to himself, ""The old grizzle-beard; an I had notfaced him a bold front, mayhap he would have put such shame upon meas he said. I wonder why he stood so staring after me as I left thegarden.""Then for the time the matter slipped from his mind, saving only thatpart that smacked of adventure.']"
82,21,Chapter 21,"['20So for a little while Myles was disposed to congratulate himself uponhaving come off so well from his adventure with the Earl. But after aday or two had passed, and he had time for second thought, he began tomisdoubt whether, after all, he might not have carried it with a betterair if he had shown more chivalrous boldness in the presence of his truelady; whether it would not have redounded more to his credit if he hadin some way asserted his rights as the young dame\'s knight-errant anddefender. Was it not ignominious to resign his rights and privileges soeasily and tamely at a signal from the Earl?""For, in sooth,"" said he to Gascoyne, as the two talked the matter over,""she hath, in a certain way, accepted me for her knight, and yet I stoodme there without saying so much as one single word in her behalf.""""Nay,"" said Gascoyne, ""I would not trouble me on that score. Methinksthat thou didst come off wondrous well out of the business. I would nothave thought it possible that my Lord could ha\' been so patient withthee as he showed himself. Methinks, forsooth, he must hold thee privilyin right high esteem.""""Truly,"" said Myles, after a little pause of meditative silence, ""I knownot of any esteem, yet I do think he was passing patient with me in thismatter. But ne\'theless, Francis, that changeth not my stand in the case.Yea, I did shamefully, so to resign my lady without speaking one word;nor will I so resign her even yet. I have bethought me much of thismatter of late, Francis, and now I come to thee to help me from my evilcase. I would have thee act the part of a true friend to me--like thatone I have told thee of in the story of the Emperor Justinian. I wouldhave thee, when next thou servest in the house, to so contrive that myLady Alice shall get a letter which I shall presently write, and whereinI may set all that is crooked straight again.""""Heaven forbid,"" said Gascoyne, hastily, ""that I should be such a foolas to burn my fingers in drawing thy nuts from the fire! Deliver thyletter thyself, good fellow!""So spoke Gascoyne, yet after all he ended, as he usually did, byyielding to Myles\'s superior will and persistence. So the letter waswritten and one day the good-natured Gascoyne carried it with him to thehouse, and the opportunity offering, gave it to one of the young ladiesattendant upon the Countess\'s family--a lass with whom he had friendlyintimacy--to be delivered to Lady Alice.But if Myles congratulated himself upon the success of this newadventure, it was not for long. That night, as the crowd of pages andsquires were making themselves ready for bed, the call came through theuproar for ""Myles Falworth! Myles Falworth!""""Here I be,"" cried Myles, standing up on his cot. ""Who calleth me?""It was the groom of the Earl\'s bedchamber, and seeing Myles standingthus raised above the others, he came walking down the length of theroom towards him, the wonted hubbub gradually silencing as he advancedand the youngsters turning, staring, and wondering.""My Lord would speak with thee, Myles Falworth,"" said the groom, when hehad come close enough to where Myles stood. ""Busk thee and make ready;he is at livery even now.""The groom\'s words fell upon Myles like a blow. He stood for a whilestaring wide-eyed. ""My Lord speak with me, sayst thou!"" he ejaculated atlast.""Aye,"" said the other, impatiently; ""get thee ready quickly. I mustreturn anon.""Myles\'s head was in a whirl as he hastily changed his clothes for abetter suit, Gascoyne helping him. What could the Earl want with him atthis hour? He knew in his heart what it was; the interview could concernnothing but the letter that he had sent to Lady Alice that day. As hefollowed the groom through the now dark and silent courts, and acrossthe corner of the great quadrangle, and so to the Earl\'s house, he triedto brace his failing courage to meet the coming interview. Nevertheless,his heart beat tumultuously as he followed the other down the longcorridor, lit only by a flaring link set in a wrought-iron bracket. Thenhis conductor lifted the arras at the door of the bedchamber, whencecame the murmuring sound of many voices, and holding it aside, beckonedhim to enter, and Myles passed within. At the first, he was consciousof nothing but a crowd of people, and of the brightness of many lightedcandles; then he saw that he stood in a great airy room spread with awoven mat of rushes. On three sides the walls were hung with tapestryrepresenting hunting and battle scenes, at the farther end, where thebed stood, the stone wall of the fourth side was covered with cloth ofblue, embroidered with silver goshawks. Even now, in the ripe springtimeof May, the room was still chilly, and a great fire roared and crackledin the huge gaping mouth of the stone fireplace. Not far from the blazewere clustered the greater part of those present, buzzing in talk, nowand then swelled by murmuring laughter. Some of those who knew Mylesnodded to him, and two or three spoke to him as he stood waiting, whilstthe groom went forward to speak to the Earl; though what they said andwhat he answered, Myles, in his bewilderment and trepidation, hardlyknew.As was said before, the livery was the last meal of the day, and wastaken in bed. It was a simple repast--a manchette, or small loaf ofbread of pure white flour, a loaf of household bread, sometimes a lumpof cheese, and either a great flagon of ale or of sweet wine, warmand spiced. The Earl was sitting upright in bed, dressed in a furreddressing-gown, and propped up by two cylindrical bolsters of crimsonsatin. Upon the coverlet, and spread over his knees, was a large widenapkin of linen fringed with silver thread, and on it rested a silvertray containing the bread and some cheese. Two pages and three gentlemenwere waiting upon him, and Mad Noll, the jester, stood at the head ofthe bed, now and then jingling his bawble and passing some quaint jestupon the chance of making his master smile. Upon a table near by weresome dozen or so waxen tapers struck upon as many spiked candlesticksof silver-gilt, and illuminating that end of the room with their brighttwinkling flames. One of the gentlemen was in the act of serving theEarl with a goblet of wine, poured from a silver ewer by one of thesquires, as the groom of the chamber came forward and spoke. The Earl,taking the goblet, turned his head, and as Myles looked, their eyes met.Then the Earl turned away again and raised the cup to his lips, whileMyles felt his heart beat more rapidly than ever.But at last the meal was ended, and the Earl washed his hands and hismouth and his beard from a silver basin of scented water held by anotherone of the squires. Then, leaning back against the pillows, he beckonedto Myles.In answer Myles walked forward the length of the room, conscious thatall eyes were fixed upon him. The Earl said something, and those whostood near drew back as he came forward. Then Myles found himselfstanding beside the bed, looking down upon the quilted counterpane,feeling that the other was gazing fixedly at him.""I sent for thee,"" said the Earl at last, still looking steadily athim, ""because this afternoon came a letter to my hand which thou hadstwritten to my niece, the Lady Alice. I have it here,"" said he, thrustinghis hand under the bolster, ""and have just now finished reading it.""Then, after a moment\'s pause, whilst he opened the parchment and scannedit again, ""I find no matter of harm in it, but hereafter write no moresuch."" He spoke entirely without anger, and Myles looked up in wonder.""Here, take it,"" said the Earl, folding the letter and tossing it toMyles, who instinctively caught it, ""and henceforth trouble thou myniece no more either by letter or any other way. I thought haply thouwouldst be at some such saucy trick, and I made Alice promise to let meknow when it happed. Now, I say, let this be an end of the matter. Dostthou not know thou mayst injure her by such witless folly as that ofmeeting her privily, and privily writing to her?""""I meant no harm,"" said Myles.""I believe thee,"" said the Earl. ""That will do now; thou mayst go.""Myles hesitated.""What wouldst thou say?"" said Lord Mackworth.""Only this,"" said Myles, ""an I have thy leave so to do, that the LadyAlice hath chosen me to be her knight, and so, whether I may see her orspeak with her or no, the laws of chivalry give me, who am gentle born,the right to serve her as a true knight may.""""As a true fool may,"" said the Earl, dryly. ""Why, how now, thou art nota knight yet, nor anything but a raw lump of a boy. What rights do thelaws of chivalry give thee, sirrah? Thou art a fool!""Had the Earl been ever so angry, his words would have been less bitterto Myles than his cool, unmoved patience; it mortified his pride andgalled it to the quick.""I know that thou dost hold me in contempt,"" he mumbled.""Out upon thee!"" said the Earl, testily. ""Thou dost tease me beyondpatience. I hold thee in contempt, forsooth! Why, look thee, hadst thoubeen other than thou art, I would have had thee whipped out of my houselong since. Thinkest thou I would have borne so patiently with anotherone of ye squires had such an one held secret meeting with my daughterand niece, and tampered, as thou hast done, with my household, sendingthrough one of my people that letter? Go to; thou art a fool, MylesFalworth!""Myles stood staring at the Earl without making an effort to speak. Thewords that he had heard suddenly flashed, as it were, a new light intohis mind. In that flash he fully recognized, and for the first time,the strange and wonderful forbearance the great Earl had shown to him,a poor obscure boy. What did it mean? Was Lord Mackworth his secretfriend, after all, as Gascoyne had more than once asserted? So Mylesstood silent, thinking many things.Meantime the other lay back upon the cylindrical bolsters, lookingthoughtfully at him. ""How old art thou?"" said he at last.""Seventeen last April,"" answered Myles.""Then thou art old enough to have some of the thoughts of a man, and tolay aside those of a boy. Haply thou hast had foolish things in thyhead this short time past; it is time that thou put them away. Harkee,sirrah! the Lady Alice is a great heiress in her own right, and maystcommand the best alliance in England--an Earl--a Duke. She groweth apaceto a woman, and then her kind lieth in Courts and great houses. As forthee, thou art but a poor lad, penniless and without friends to aid theeto open advancement. Thy father is attainted, and one whisper of wherehe lieth hid would bring him thence to the Tower, and haply to theblock. Besides that, he hath an enemy, as Sir James Lee hath alreadytold thee--an enemy perhaps more great and powerful than myself. Thatenemy watcheth for thy father and for thee; shouldst thou dare raise thyhead or thy fortune ever so little, he would haply crop them both, andthat parlously quick. Myles Falworth, how dost thou dare to lift thineeyes to the Lady Alice de Mowbray?""Poor Myles stood silent and motionless. ""Sir,"" said he at last, in adry choking voice, ""thou art right, and I have been a fool. Sir, I willnever raise mine eyes to look upon the Lady Alice more.""""I say not that either, boy,"" said the Earl; ""but ere thou dost so dare,thou must first place thyself and thy family whence ye fell. Till then,as thou art an honest man, trouble her not. Now get thee gone.""As Myles crossed the dark and silent courtyards, and looked up at theclear, still twinkle of the stars, he felt a kind of dull wonder thatthey and the night and the world should seem so much the same, and he beso different.The first stroke had been given that was to break in pieces his boyhoodlife--the second was soon to follow.']"
82,22,Chapter 22,"['21There are now and then times in the life of every one when new andstrange things occur with such rapidity that one has hardly time tocatch one\'s breath between the happenings. It is as though the old werecrumbling away--breaking in pieces--to give place to the new that issoon to take its place.So it was with Myles Falworth about this time. The very next day afterthis interview in the bed-chamber, word came to him that Sir James Leewished to speak with him in the office. He found the lean, grizzled oldknight alone, sitting at the heavy oaken table with a tankard of spicedale at his elbow, and a dish of wafers and some fragments of cheese on apewter platter before him. He pointed to his clerk\'s seat--a joint stoolsomewhat like a camp-chair, but made of heavy oaken braces and with aseat of hog-skin--and bade Myles be seated.It was the first time that Myles had ever heard of such courtesy beingextended to one of the company of squires, and, much wondering, heobeyed the invitation, or rather command, and took the seat.The old knight sat regarding him for a while in silence, his one eye,as bright and as steady as that of a hawk, looking keenly from under thepenthouse of its bushy brows, the while he slowly twirled and twistedhis bristling wiry mustaches, as was his wont when in meditation. Atlast he broke the silence. ""How old art thou?"" said he, abruptly.""I be turned seventeen last April,"" Myles answered, as he had theevening before to Lord Mackworth.""Humph!"" said Sir James; ""thou be\'st big of bone and frame for thineage. I would that thy heart were more that of a man likewise, and lessthat of a giddy, hare-brained boy, thinking continually of naught butmischief.""Again he fell silent, and Myles sat quite still, wondering if it wason account of any special one of his latest escapades that he had beensummoned to the office--the breaking of the window in the Long Hall bythe stone he had flung at the rook, or the climbing of the South Towerfor the jackdaw\'s nest.""Thou hast a friend,"" said Sir James, suddenly breaking into hisspeculations, ""of such a kind that few in this world possess. Almostever since thou hast been here he hath been watching over thee. Canstthou guess of whom I speak?""""Haply it is Lord George Beaumont,"" said Myles; ""he hath always beenpassing kind to me.""Nay,"" said Sir James, ""it is not of him that I speak, though methinkshe liketh thee well enow. Canst thou keep a secret, boy?"" he asked,suddenly.""Yea,"" answered Myles.""And wilt thou do so in this case if I tell thee who it is that is thybest friend here?""""Yea.""""Then it is my Lord who is that friend--the Earl himself; but see thatthou breathe not a word of it.""Myles sat staring at the old knight in utter and profound amazement, andpresently Sir James continued: ""Yea, almost ever since thou hast comehere my Lord hath kept oversight upon all thy doings, upon all thy madpranks and thy quarrels and thy fights, thy goings out and comings in.What thinkest thou of that, Myles Falworth?""Again the old knight stopped and regarded the lad, who sat silent,finding no words to answer. He seemed to find a grim pleasure in theyoungster\'s bewilderment and wonder. Then a sudden thought came toMyles.""Sir,"" said he, ""did my Lord know that I went to the privy garden as Idid?""""Nay,"" said Sir James; ""of that he knew naught at first until thy fatherbade thy mother write and tell him.""""My father!"" ejaculated Myles.""Aye,"" said Sir James, twisting his mustaches more vigorously than ever.""So soon as thy father heard of that prank, he wrote straightway tomy Lord that he should put a stop to what might in time have bredmischief.""""Sir,"" said Myles, in an almost breathless voice, ""I know not how tobelieve all these things, or whether I be awake or a-dreaming.""""Thou be\'st surely enough awake,"" answered the old man; ""but there areother matters yet to be told. My Lord thinketh, as others of us do--LordGeorge and myself--that it is now time for thee to put away thy boyishfollies, and learn those things appertaining to manhood. Thou hast beenhere a year now, and hast had freedom to do as thou might list; but,boy,""--and the old warrior spoke seriously, almost solemnly--""upon theedoth rest matters of such great import that did I tell them to thee thoucouldst not grasp them. My Lord deems that thou hast, mayhap, promisebeyond the common of men; ne\'theless it remaineth yet to be seen an hebe right; it is yet to test whether that promise may be fulfilled. NextMonday I and Sir Everard Willoughby take thee in hand to begin trainingthee in the knowledge and the use of the jousting lance, of arms, and ofhorsemanship. Thou art to go to Ralph Smith, and have him fit a suit ofplain armor to thee which he hath been charged to make for thee againstthis time. So get thee gone, think well over all these matters, andprepare thyself by next Monday. But stay, sirrah,"" he added, as Myles,dazed and bewildered, turned to obey; ""breathe to no living soul whatI ha\' told thee--that my Lord is thy friend--neither speak of anythingconcerning him. Such is his own heavy command laid upon thee.""Then Myles turned again without a word to leave the room. But as hereached the door Sir James stopped him a second time.""Stay!"" he called. ""I had nigh missed telling thee somewhat else. MyLord hath made thee a present this morning that thou wottest not of. Itis""--then he stopped for a few moments, perhaps to enjoy the full flavorof what he had to say--""it is a great Flemish horse of true breed andright mettle; a horse such as a knight of the noblest strain might beproud to call his own. Myles Falworth, thou wert born upon a lucky day!""""Sir,"" cried Myles, and then stopped short. Then, ""Sir,"" he cried again,""didst thou say it--the horse--was to be mine?""""Aye, it is to be thine.""""My very own?""""Thy very own.""How Myles Falworth left that place he never knew. He was like one insome strange, some wonderful dream. He walked upon air, and his heartwas so full of joy and wonder and amazement that it thrilled almost toagony. Of course his first thought was of Gascoyne. How he ever foundhim he never could tell, but find him he did.""Come, Francis!"" he cried, ""I have that to tell thee so marvellous thathad it come upon me from paradise it could not be more strange.""Then he dragged him away to their Eyry--it had been many a long daysince they had been there--and to all his friend\'s speeches, to all hiswondering questions, he answered never a word until they had climbed thestairs, and so come to their old haunt. Then he spoke.""Sit thee down, Francis,"" said he, ""till I tell thee that which passethwonder."" As Gascoyne obeyed, he himself stood looking about him. ""Thisis the last time I shall ever come hither,"" said he. And thereupon hepoured out his heart to his listening friend in the murmuring solitudeof the airy height. He did not speak of the Earl, but of the wonderfulnew life that had thus suddenly opened before him, with its goldenfuture of limitless hopes, of dazzling possibilities, of heroicambitions. He told everything, walking up and down the while--for hecould not remain quiet--his cheeks glowing and his eyes sparkling.Gascoyne sat quite still, staring straight before him. He knew that hisfriend was ruffling eagle pinions for a flight in which he could neverhope to follow, and somehow his heart ached, for he knew that this mustbe the beginning of the end of the dear, delightful friendship of theyear past.']"
82,23,Chapter 23,"['22And so ended Myles Falworth\'s boyhood. Three years followed, duringwhich he passed through that state which immediately follows boyhood inall men\'s lives--a time when they are neither lads nor grown men, butyouths passing from the one to the other period through what is often anuncouth and uncomfortable age.He had fancied, when he talked with Gascoyne in the Eyry that time,that he was to become a man all at once; he felt just then that he hadforever done with boyish things. But that is not the way it happens inmen\'s lives. Changes do not come so suddenly and swiftly as that, but bylittle and little. For three or four days, maybe, he went his new way oflife big with the great change that had come upon him, and then, nowin this and now in that, he drifted back very much into his old waysof boyish doings. As was said, one\'s young days do not end all at once,even when they be so suddenly and sharply shaken, and Myles was notdifferent from others. He had been stirred to the core by that firstwonderful sight of the great and glorious life of manhood opening beforehim, but he had yet many a sport to enjoy, many a game to play, many aboisterous romp to riot in the dormitory, many an expedition to maketo copse and spinney and river on days when he was off duty, and whenpermission had been granted.Nevertheless, there was a great and vital change in his life; a changewhich he hardly felt or realized. Even in resuming his old life therewas no longer the same vitality, the same zest, the same enjoyment inall these things. It seemed as though they were no longer a part ofhimself. The savor had gone from them, and by-and-by it was pleasanterto sit looking on at the sports and the games of the younger lads thanto take active part in them.These three years of his life that had thus passed had been very full;full mostly of work, grinding and monotonous; of training dull, dry,laborious. For Sir James Lee was a taskmaster as hard as iron andseemingly as cold as a stone. For two, perhaps for three, weeks Mylesentered into his new exercises with all the enthusiasm that noveltybrings; but these exercises hardly varied a tittle from day to day, andsoon became a duty, and finally a hard and grinding task. He used, inthe earlier days of his castle life, to hate the dull monotony of thetri-weekly hacking at the pels with a heavy broadsword as he hatednothing else; but now, though he still had that exercise to perform, itwas almost a relief from the heavy dulness of riding, riding, riding inthe tilt-yard with shield and lance--couch--recover--en passant.But though he had nowadays but little time for boyish plays andescapades, his life was not altogether without relaxation. Now andthen he was permitted to drive in mock battle with other of the youngerknights and bachelors in the paddock near the outer walls. It was astill more welcome change in the routine of his life when, occasionally,he would break a light lance in the tilting-court with Sir EverardWilloughby; Lord George, perhaps, and maybe one or two others of theHall folk, looking on.Then one gilded day, when Lord Dudleigh was visiting at Devlen, Mylesran a course with a heavier lance in the presence of the Earl, who camedown to the tilt-yard with his guest to see the young novitiate rideagainst Sir Everard. He did his best, and did it well. Lord Dudleighpraised his poise and carriage, and Lord George, who was present, gavehim an approving smile and nod. But the Earl of Mackworth only satstroking his beard impassively, as was his custom. Myles would havegiven much to know his thoughts.In all these years Sir James Lee almost never gave any expression eitherof approbation or disapproval--excepting when Myles exhibited somecarelessness or oversight. Then his words were sharp and harsh enough.More than once Myles\'s heart failed him, and bitter discouragementtook possession of him; then nothing but his bull-dog tenacity andstubbornness brought him out from the despondency of the dark hours.""Sir,"" he burst out one day, when his heart was heavy with some failure,""tell me, I beseech thee, do I get me any of skill at all? Is it in meever to make a worthy knight, fit to hold lance and sword with othermen, or am I only soothly a dull heavy block, worth naught of any good?""""Thou art a fool, sirrah!"" answered Sir James, in his grimmest tones.""Thinkest thou to learn all of knightly prowess in a year and a half?Wait until thou art ripe, and then I will tell thee if thou art fit tocouch a lance or ride a course with a right knight.""""Thou art an old bear!"" muttered Myles to himself, as the old one-eyedknight turned on his heel and strode away. ""Beshrew me! an I show theenot that I am as worthy to couch a lance as thou one of these finedays!""However, during the last of the three years the grinding routine of histraining had not been quite so severe as at first. His exercises tookhim more often out into the fields, and it was during this time of hisknightly education that he sometimes rode against some of the castleknights in friendly battle with sword or lance or wooden mace. In theseencounters he always held his own; and held it more than well, though,in his boyish simplicity, he was altogether unconscious of his ownskill, address, and strength. Perhaps it was his very honest modestythat made him so popular and so heartily liked by all.He had by this time risen to the place of head squire or chief bachelor,holding the same position that Walter Blunt had occupied when he himselfhad first come, a raw country boy, to Devlen. The lesser squiresand pages fairly worshipped him as a hero, albeit imposing upon hisgood-nature. All took a pride in his practice in knightly exercises, andfabulous tales were current among the young fry concerning his strengthand skill.Yet, although Myles was now at the head of his class, he did not,as other chief bachelors had done, take a leading position among thesquires in the Earl\'s household service. Lord Mackworth, for his owngood reasons, relegated him to the position of Lord George\'s especialattendant. Nevertheless, the Earl always distinguished him from theother esquires, giving him a cool nod whenever they met; and Myles, uponhis part--now that he had learned better to appreciate how much his Lordhad done for him--would have shed the last drop of blood in his veinsfor the head of the house of Beaumont.As for the two young ladies, he often saw them, and sometimes, evenin the presence of the Earl, exchanged a few words with them, and LordMackworth neither forbade it nor seemed to notice it.Towards the Lady Anne he felt the steady friendly regard of a lad for agirl older than himself; towards the Lady Alice, now budding into ripeyoung womanhood, there lay deep in his heart the resolve to be some dayher true knight in earnest as he had been her knight in pretence in thattime of boyhood when he had so perilously climbed into the privy garden.In body and form he was now a man, and in thought and heart was quicklyripening to manhood, for, as was said before, men matured quickly inthose days. He was a right comely youth, for the promise of his boyishbody had been fulfilled in a tall, powerful, well-knit frame. His facewas still round and boyish, but on cheek and chin and lip was the curlof adolescent beard--soft, yellow, and silky. His eyes were as blueas steel, and quick and sharp in glance as those of a hawk; and as hewalked, his arms swung from his broad, square shoulders, and his bodyswayed with pent-up strength ready for action at any moment.If little Lady Alice, hearing much talk of his doings and of his promisein these latter times, thought of him now and then it is a matter notaltogether to be wondered at.Such were the changes that three years had wrought. And from now thestory of his manhood really begins.Perhaps in all the history of Devlen Castle, even at this, the high tideof pride and greatness of the house of Beaumont, the most notable timewas in the early autumn of the year 1411, when for five days King HenryIV was entertained by the Earl of Mackworth. The King was at that timemaking a progress through certain of the midland counties, and with himtravelled the Comte de Vermoise. The Count was the secret emissary ofthe Dauphin\'s faction in France, at that time in the very bitterestintensity of the struggle with the Duke of Burgundy, and had come toEngland seeking aid for his master in his quarrel.It was not the first time that royalty had visited Devlen. Once, in EarlRobert\'s day, King Edward II had spent a week at the castle during theperiod of the Scottish wars. But at that time it was little else than amilitary post, and was used by the King as such. Now the Beaumonts werein the very flower of their prosperity, and preparations were madefor the coming visit of royalty upon a scale of such magnificence andsplendor as Earl Robert, or perhaps even King Edward himself, had neverdreamed.For weeks the whole castle had been alive with folk hurrying hither andthither; and with the daily and almost hourly coming of pack-horses,laden with bales and boxes, from London. From morning to night one heardthe ceaseless chip-chipping of the masons\' hammers, and saw carriersof stones and mortar ascending and descending the ladders of thescaffolding that covered the face of the great North Hall. Within, thatpart of the building was alive with the scraping of the carpenters\'saws, the clattering of lumber, and the rapping and banging of hammers.The North Hall had been assigned as the lodging place for the King andhis court, and St. George\'s Hall (as the older building adjoining it wascalled) had been set apart as the lodging of the Comte de Vermoise andthe knights and gentlemen attendant upon him.The great North Hall had been very much altered and changed for theaccommodation of the King and his people; a beautiful gallery of carvedwood-work had been built within and across the south end of the room forthe use of the ladies who were to look down upon the ceremonies below.Two additional windows had been cut through the wall and glazed, andpassage-ways had been opened connecting with the royal apartmentsbeyond. In the bedchamber a bed of carved wood and silver had beenbuilt into the wall, and had been draped with hangings of pale blue andsilver, and a magnificent screen of wrought-iron and carved wood hadbeen erected around the couch; rich and beautiful tapestries broughtfrom Italy and Flanders were hung upon the walls; cushions of velvetsand silks stuffed with down covered benches and chairs. The floor ofthe hall was spread with mats of rushes stained in various colors, woveninto curious patterns, and in the smaller rooms precious carpets ofarras were laid on the cold stones.All of the cadets of the House had been assembled; all of thegentlemen in waiting, retainers and clients. The castle seemed full tooverflowing; even the dormitory of the squires was used as a lodgingplace for many of the lesser gentry.So at last, in the midst of all this bustle of preparation, came the dayof days when the King was to arrive. The day before a courier had comebringing the news that he was lodging at Donaster Abbey overnight, andwould make progress the next day to Devlen.That morning, as Myles was marshalling the pages and squires, and, withthe list of names in his hand, was striving to evolve some order outof the confusion, assigning the various individuals their specialduties--these to attend in the household, those to ride in theescort--one of the gentlemen of Lord George\'s household came with anorder for him to come immediately to the young nobleman\'s apartments.Myles hastily turned over his duties to Gascoyne and Wilkes, and thenhurried after the messenger. He found Lord George in the antechamber,three gentlemen squires arming him in a magnificent suit of ribbedMilan.He greeted Myles with a nod and a smile as the lad entered. ""Sirrah,""said he, ""I have had a talk with Mackworth this morn concerning thee,and have a mind to do thee an honor in my poor way. How wouldst thoulike to ride to-day as my special squire of escort?""Myles flushed to the roots of his hair. ""Oh, sir!"" he cried, eagerly,""an I be not too ungainly for thy purpose, no honor in all the worldcould be such joy to me as that!""Lord George laughed. ""A little matter pleases thee hugely,"" said he;""but as to being ungainly, who so sayeth that of thee belieth thee,Myles; thou art not ungainly, sirrah. But that is not to the point. Ihave chosen thee for my equerry to-day; so make thou haste and don thinearmor, and then come hither again, and Hollingwood will fit thee with awreathed bascinet I have within, and a juppon embroidered with my armsand colors.""When Myles had made his bow and left his patron, he flew across thequadrangle, and burst into the armory upon Gascoyne, whom he found stilllingering there, chatting with one or two of the older bachelors.""What thinkest thou, Francis?"" he cried, wild with excitement. ""An honorhath been done me this day I could never have hoped to enjoy. Out ofall this household, Lord George hath chose me his equerry for the day toride to meet the King. Come, hasten to help me to arm! Art thou not gladof this thing for my sake, Francis?""""Aye, glad am I indeed!"" cried Gascoyne, that generous friend; ""ratheralmost would I have this befall thee than myself!"" And indeed he washardly less jubilant than Myles over the honor.Five minutes later he was busy arming him in the little room at the endof the dormitory which had been lately set apart for the use of the headbachelor. ""And to think,"" he said, looking up as he kneeled, strappingthe thigh-plates to his friend\'s legs, ""that he should have chosen theebefore all others of the fine knights and lords and gentlemen of qualitythat are here!""""Yea,"" said Myles, ""it passeth wonder. I know not why he should sosingle me out for such an honor. It is strangely marvellous.""""Nay,"" said Gascoyne, ""there is no marvel in it, and I know right wellwhy he chooseth thee. It is because he sees, as we all see, that thouart the stoutest and the best-skilled in arms, and most easy of carriageof any man in all this place.""Myles laughed. ""An thou make sport of me,"" said he, ""I\'ll rap thy headwith this dagger hilt. Thou art a silly fellow, Francis, to talk so. Buttell me, hast thou heard who rides with my Lord?""""Yea, I heard Wilkes say anon that it was Sir James Lee.""""I am right glad of that,"" said Myles; ""for then he will show me what todo and how to bear myself. It frights me to think what would hap shouldI make some mistake in my awkwardness. Methinks Lord George would neverhave me with him more should I do amiss this day.""""Never fear,"" said Gascoyne; ""thou wilt not do amiss.""And now, at last, the Earl, Lord George, and all their escort wereready; then the orders were given to horse, the bugle sounded, and awaythey all rode, with clashing of iron hoofs and ringing and jinglingof armor, out into the dewy freshness of the early morning, the slantyellow sun of autumn blazing and flaming upon polished helmets andshields, and twinkling like sparks of fire upon spear points. Myles\'sheart thrilled within him for pure joy, and he swelled out his sturdyyoung breast with great draughts of the sweet fresh air that camesinging across the sunny hill-tops. Sir James Lee, who acted as theEarl\'s equerry for the day, rode at a little distance, and there was analmost pathetic contrast between the grim, steadfast impassiveness ofthe tough old warrior and Myles\'s passionate exuberance of youth.At the head of the party rode the Earl and his brother side by side,each clad cap-a-pie in a suit of Milan armor, the cuirass of eachcovered with a velvet juppon embroidered in silver with the arms andquarterings of the Beaumonts. The Earl wore around his neck an ""S S""collar, with a jewelled St. George hanging from it, and upon his head avizored bascinet, ornamented with a wreath covered with black and yellowvelvet and glistening with jewels.Lord George, as was said before, was clad in a beautiful suit of ribbedMilan armor. It was rimmed with a thin thread of gold, and, like hisbrother, he wore a bascinet wreathed with black and yellow velvet.Behind the two brothers and their equerries rode the rest in theirproper order--knights, gentlemen, esquires, men-at-arms--to the number,perhaps, of two hundred and fifty; spears and lances aslant, andbanners, permons, and pencels of black and yellow fluttering in the warmSeptember air.From the castle to the town they rode, and then across the bridge, andthence clattering up through the stony streets, where the folk lookeddown upon them from the windows above, or crowded the fronts of theshops of the tradesmen. Lusty cheers were shouted for the Earl, but thegreat Lord rode staring ever straight before him, as unmoved as a stone.Then out of the town they clattered, and away in a sweeping cloud ofdust across the country-side.It was not until they had reached the windy top of Willoughby Croft, tenmiles away, that they met the King and his company. As the two partiesapproached to within forty or fifty yards of one another they stopped.As they came to a halt, Myles observed that a gentleman dressed ina plain blue-gray riding-habit, and sitting upon a beautiful whitegelding, stood a little in advance of the rest of the party, and he knewthat that must be the King. Then Sir James nodded to Myles, and leapingfrom his horse, flung the reins to one of the attendants. Myles didthe like; and then, still following Sir James\'s lead as he servedLord Mackworth, went forward and held Lord George\'s stirrup while hedismounted. The two noblemen quickly removed each his bascinet, andMyles, holding the bridle-rein of Lord George\'s horse with his lefthand, took the helmet in his right, resting it upon his hip.Then the two brothers walked forward bare-headed, the Earl, a little inadvance. Reaching the King he stopped, and then bent his knee--stifflyin the armored plates--until it touched the ground. Thereupon the Kingreached him his hand, and he, rising again, took it, and set it to hislips.Then Lord George, advancing, kneeled as his brother had kneeled, and tohim also the King gave his hand.Myles could hear nothing, but he could see that a few words of greetingpassed between the three, and then the King, turning, beckoned to aknight who stood just behind him and a little in advance of the othersof the troop. In answer, the knight rode forward; the King spoke a fewwords of introduction, and the stranger, ceremoniously drawing off hisright gauntlet, clasped the hand, first of the Earl, and then of LordGeorge. Myles knew that he must be the great Comte de Vermoise, of whomhe had heard so much of late.A few moments of conversation followed, and then the King bowedslightly. The French nobleman instantly reined back his horse, an orderwas given, and then the whole company moved forward, the two brotherswalking upon either side of the King, the Earl lightly touching thebridle-rein with his bare hand.Whilst all this was passing, the Earl of Mackworth\'s company had beendrawn up in a double line along the road-side, leaving the way open tothe other party. As the King reached the head of the troop, another haltfollowed while he spoke a few courteous words of greeting to some of thelesser nobles attendant upon the Earl whom he knew.In that little time he was within a few paces of Myles, who stoodmotionless as a statue, holding the bascinet and the bridle-rein of LordGeorge\'s horse.What Myles saw was a plain, rather stout man, with a face fat, smooth,and waxy, with pale-blue eyes, and baggy in the lids; clean shaven,except for a mustache and tuft covering lips and chin. Somehow he felta deep disappointment. He had expected to see something lion-like,something regal, and, after all, the great King Henry was commonplace,fat, unwholesome-looking. It came to him with a sort of a shock that,after all, a King was in nowise different from other men.Meanwhile the Earl and his brother replaced their bascinets, andpresently the whole party moved forward upon the way to Mackworth.']"
82,24,Chapter 24,"['23That same afternoon the squires\' quarters were thrown into such aferment of excitement as had, perhaps, never before stirred them. Aboutone o\'clock in the afternoon the Earl himself and Lord George camewalking slowly across the Armory Court wrapped in deep conversation, andentered Sir James Lee\'s office.All the usual hubbub of noise that surrounded the neighborhood of thedormitory and the armory was stilled at their coming, and when the twonoblemen had entered Sir James\'s office, the lads and young men gatheredin knots discussing with an almost awesome interest what that visitmight portend.After some time Sir James Lee came to the door at the head of the longflight of stone steps, and whistling, beckoned one of the smaller pagesto him. He gave a short order that sent the little fellow flying on somemission. In the course of a few minutes he returned, hurrying acrossthe stony court with Myles Falworth, who presently entered Sir James\'soffice. It was then and at this sight that the intense half-suppressedexcitement reached its height of fever-heat. What did it all mean? Theair was filled with a thousand vague, wild rumors--but the very wildestsurmises fell short of the real truth.Perhaps Myles was somewhat pale when he entered the office; certainlyhis nerves were in a tremor, for his heart told him that something veryportentous was about to befall him. The Earl sat at the table, and inthe seat that Sir James Lee usually occupied; Lord George half sat, halfleaned in the window-place. Sir James stood with his back to theempty fireplace, and his hands clasped behind him. All three were veryserious.""Give thee good den, Myles Falworth,"" said the Earl, as Myles bowedfirst to him and then to the others; ""and I would have thee preparethyself for a great happening."" Then, continuing directly to the point:""Thou knowest, sirrah, why we have been training thee so closely thesethree years gone; it is that thou shouldst be able to hold thine ownin the world. Nay, not only hold thine own, but to show thyself to bea knight of prowess shouldst it come to a battle between thee and thyfather\'s enemy; for there lieth no half-way place for thee, and thoumust be either great or else nothing. Well, sir, the time hath now comefor thee to show thy mettle. I would rather have chosen that thou hadstlabored a twelvemonth longer; but now, as I said, hath come a chance toprove thyself that may never come again. Sir James tells me that thouart passably ripe in skill. Thou must now show whether that be so or no.Hast thou ever heard of the Sieur de la Montaigne?""""Yea, my Lord. I have heard of him often,"" answered Myles. ""It was hewho won the prize at the great tourney at Rochelle last year.""""I see that thou hast his fame pat to thy tongue\'s end,"" said the Earl;""he is the chevalier of whom I speak, and he is reckoned the best knightof Dauphiny. That one of which thou spokest was the third great tourneyin which he was adjudged the victor. I am glad that thou holdest hisprowess highly. Knowest thou that he is in the train of the Comte deVermoise?""""Nay,"" said Myles, flushing; ""I did hear news he was in England, butknew not that he was in this place.""""Yea,"" said Lord Mackworth; ""he is here."" He paused for a moment; thensaid, suddenly. ""Tell me, Myles Falworth, an thou wert a knight and ofrank fit to run a joust with the Sieur de la Montaigne, wouldst thoudare encounter him in the lists?""The Earl\'s question fell upon Myles so suddenly and unexpectedly thatfor a moment or so he stood staring at the speaker with mouth agape.Meanwhile the Earl sat looking calmly back at him, slowly stroking hisbeard the while.It was Sir James Lee\'s voice that broke the silence. ""Thou heardst thyLord speak,"" said he, harshly. ""Hast thou no tongue to answer, sirrah?""""Be silent, Lee,"" said Lord Mackworth, quietly. ""Let the lad have timeto think before he speaketh.""The sound of the words aroused Myles. He advanced to the table, andrested his hand upon it. ""My Lord--my Lord,"" said he, ""I know not whatto say, I--I am amazed and afeard.""""How! how!"" cried Sir James Lee, harshly. ""Afeard, sayst thou? An thouart afeard, thou knave, thou needst never look upon my face or speak tome more! I have done with thee forever an thou art afeard even were thechampion a Sir Alisander.""""Peace, peace, Lee,"" said the Earl, holding up his hand. ""Thou art toohasty. The lad shall have his will in this matter, and thou and no oneshall constrain him. Methinks, also, thou dost not understand him. Speakfrom thy heart, Myles; why art thou afraid?""""Because,"" said Myles, ""I am so young, sir; I am but a raw boy. Howshould I dare be so hardy as to venture to set lance against such an oneas the Sieur de la Montaigne? What would I be but a laughing-stock forall the world who would see me so foolish as to venture me against oneof such prowess and skill?""""Nay, Myles,"" said Lord George, ""thou thinkest not well enough of thineown skill and prowess. Thinkest thou we would undertake to set theeagainst him, an we did not think that thou couldst hold thine own fairlywell?""""Hold mine own?"" cried Myles, turning to Lord George. ""Sir; thou dostnot mean--thou canst not mean, that I may hope or dream to hold mine ownagainst the Sieur de la Montaigne.""""Aye,"" said Lord George, ""that was what I did mean.""""Come, Myles,"" said the Earl; ""now tell me: wilt thou fight the Sieur dela Montaigne?""""Yea,"" said Myles, drawing himself to his full height and throwing outhis chest. ""Yea,"" and his cheeks and forehead flushed red; ""an thou bidme do so, I will fight him.""""There spake my brave lad!"" cried Lord George heartily.""I give thee joy, Myles,"" said the Earl, reaching him his hand, whichMyles took and kissed. ""And I give thee double joy. I have talked withthe King concerning thee this morning, and he hath consented to knightthee--yea, to knight thee with all honors of the Bath--provided thouwilt match thee against the Sieur de la Montaigne for the honor ofEngland and Mackworth. Just now the King lieth to sleep for a littlewhile after his dinner; have thyself in readiness when he cometh forth,and I will have thee presented.""Then the Earl turned to Sir James Lee, and questioned him as to how thebachelors were fitted with clothes. Myles listened, only half hearingthe words through the tumbling of his thoughts. He had dreamed in hisday-dreams that some time he might be knighted, but that time alwaysseemed very, very distant. To be knighted now, in his boyhood, by theKing, with the honors of the Bath, and under the patronage of theEarl of Mackworth; to joust--to actually joust--with the Sieur de laMontaigne, one of the most famous chevaliers of France! No wonder heonly half heard the words; half heard the Earl\'s questions concerninghis clothes and the discussion which followed; half heard Lord Georgevolunteer to array him in fitting garments from his own wardrobe.""Thou mayst go now,"" said the Earl, at last turning to him. ""But be thouat George\'s apartments by two of the clock to be dressed fittingly forthe occasion.""Then Myles went out stupefied, dazed, bewildered. He looked around,but he did not see Gascoyne. He said not a word to any of the others inanswer to the eager questions poured upon him by his fellow-squires,but walked straight away. He hardly knew where he went, but by-and-byhe found himself in a grassy angle below the end of the south stable; aspot overlooking the outer wall and the river beyond. He looked around;no one was near, and he flung himself at length, burying his face inhis arms. How long he lay there he did not know, but suddenly someone touched him upon the shoulder, and he sprang up quickly. It wasGascoyne.""What is to do, Myles?"" said his friend, anxiously. ""What is all thistalk I hear concerning thee up yonder at the armory?""""Oh, Francis!"" cried Myles, with a husky choking voice: ""I am to beknighted--by the King--by the King himself; and I--I am to fight theSieur de la Montaigne.""He reached out his hand, and Gascoyne took it. They stood for a whilequite silent, and when at last the stillness was broken, it was Gascoynewho spoke, in a choking voice.""Thou art going to be great, Myles,"" said he. ""I always knew that itmust be so with thee, and now the time hath come. Yea, thou wilt begreat, and live at court amongst noble folk, and Kings haply. Presentlythou wilt not be with me any more, and wilt forget me by-and-by.""""Nay, Francis, never will I forget thee!"" answered Myles, pressinghis friend\'s hand. ""I will always love thee better than any one in theworld, saving only my father and my mother.""Gascoyne shook his head and looked away, swallowing at the dry lump inhis throat. Suddenly he turned to Myles. ""Wilt thou grant me a boon?""""Yea,"" answered Myles. ""What is it?""""That thou wilt choose me for thy squire.""""Nay,"" said Myles; ""how canst thou think to serve me as squire? Thouwilt be a knight thyself some day, Francis, and why dost thou wish nowto be my squire?""""Because,"" said Gascoyne, with a short laugh, ""I would rather be in thycompany as a squire than in mine own as a knight, even if I might bebanneret.""Myles flung his arm around his friend\'s neck, and kissed him upon thecheek. ""Thou shalt have thy will,"" said he; ""but whether knight orsquire, thou art ever mine own true friend.""Then they went slowly back together, hand in hand, to the castle worldagain.At two o\'clock Myles went to Lord George\'s apartments, and there hisfriend and patron dressed him out in a costume better fitted for theceremony of presentation--a fur-trimmed jacket of green brocaded velvetembroidered with golden thread, a black velvet hood-cap rolled like aturban and with a jewel in the front, a pair of crimson hose, and a pairof black velvet shoes trimmed and stitched with gold-thread. Myles hadnever worn such splendid clothes in his life before, and he could notbut feel that they became him well.""Sir,"" said he, as he looked down at himself, ""sure it is not lawful forme to wear such clothes as these.""In those days there was a law, known as a sumptuary law, which regulatedby statute the clothes that each class of people were privileged towear. It was, as Myles said, against the law for him to wear suchgarments as those in which he was clad--either velvet, crimson stuff,fur or silver or gold embroidery--nevertheless such a solemn ceremony aspresentation to the King excused the temporary overstepping of the law,and so Lord George told him. As he laid his hand upon the lad\'s shoulderand held him off at arm\'s-length, he added, ""And I pledge thee my word,Myles, that thou art as lusty and handsome a lad as ever mine eyesbeheld.""""Thou art very kind to me, sir,"" said Myles, in answer.Lord George laughed; and then giving him a shake, let go his shoulder.It was about three o\'clock when little Edmond de Montefort, LordMackworth\'s favorite page, came with word that the King was then walkingin the Earl\'s pleasance.""Come, Myles,"" said Lord George, and then Myles arose from theseat where he had been sitting, his heart palpitating and throbbingtumultuously.At the wicket-gate of the pleasance two gentlemen-at-arms stood guard inhalf-armor; they saluted Lord George, and permitted him to pass with hisprotege. As he laid his hand upon the latch of the wicket he paused fora moment and turned.""Myles,"" said he, in a low voice, ""thou art a thoughtful and cautiouslad; for thy father\'s sake be thoughtful and cautious now. Do notspeak his name or betray that thou art his son."" Then he opened thewicket-gate and entered.Any lad of Myles\'s age, even one far more used to the world than he,would perhaps have felt all the oppression that he experienced under theweight of such a presentation. He hardly knew what he was doing asLord George led him to where the King stood, a little apart fromthe attendants, with the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise. Even in hisconfusion he knew enough to kneel, and somehow his honest, modestdiffidence became the young fellow very well. He was not awkward, forone so healthful in mind and body as he could not bear himself very ill,and he felt the assurance that in Lord George he had a kind friend athis side, and one well used to court ceremonies to lend him countenance.Then there is something always pleasing in frank, modest manliness suchas was stamped on Myles\'s handsome, sturdy face. No doubt the King\'sheart warmed towards the fledgling warrior kneeling in the pathwaybefore him. He smiled very kindly as he gave the lad his hand to kiss,and that ceremony done, held fast to the hard, brown, sinewy fist of theyoung man with his soft white hand, and raised him to his feet.""By the mass!"" said he, looking Myles over with smiling eyes, ""thou arta right champion in good sooth. Such as thou art haply was Sir Galahadwhen he came to Arthur\'s court. And so they tell me, thou hast stomachto brook the Sieur de la Montaigne, that tough old boar of Dauphiny.Hast thou in good sooth the courage to face him? Knowest thou what agreat thing it is that thou hast set upon thyself--to do battle, even insport, with him?""""Yea, your Majesty,"" answered Myles, ""well I wot it is a task haplybeyond me. But gladly would I take upon me even a greater venture, andone more dangerous, to do your Majesty\'s pleasure!""The King looked pleased. ""Now that was right well said, young man,"" saidhe, ""and I like it better that it came from such young and honest lips.Dost thou speak French?""""Yea, your Majesty,"" answered Myles. ""In some small measure do I so.""""I am glad of that,"" said the King; ""for so I may make thee acquaintedwith Sieur de la Montaigne.""He turned as he ended speaking, and beckoned to a heavy, thick-set,black-browed chevalier who stood with the other gentlemen attendants ata little distance. He came instantly forward in answer to the summons,and the King introduced the two to one another. As each took the otherformally by the hand, he measured his opponent hastily, body and limb,and perhaps each thought that he had never seen a stronger, stouter,better-knit man than the one upon whom he looked. But neverthelessthe contrast betwixt the two was very great--Myles, young, boyish,fresh-faced; the other, bronzed, weather beaten, and seamed with a greatwhite scar that ran across his forehead and cheek; the one a novice, theother a warrior seasoned in twoscore battles.A few polite phrases passed between the two, the King listening smiling,but with an absent and far-away look gradually stealing upon his face.As they ended speaking, a little pause of silence followed, and then theKing suddenly aroused himself.""So,"" said he, ""I am glad that ye two are acquainted. And now we willleave our youthful champion in thy charge, Beaumont--and in thine, MonSieur, as well--and so soon as the proper ceremonies are ended, we willdub him knight with our own hands. And now, Mackworth, and thou my LordCount, let us walk a little; I have bethought me further concerningthese threescore extra men for Dauphiny.""Then Myles withdrew, under the charge of Lord George and the Sieur dela Montaigne and while the King and the two nobles walked slowly up anddown the gravel path between the tall rose-bushes, Myles stoodtalking with the gentlemen attendants, finding himself, with a certaintriumphant exultation, the peer of any and the hero of the hour.That night was the last that Myles and Gascoyne spent lodging in thedormitory in their squirehood service. The next day they were assignedapartments in Lord George\'s part of the house, and thither theytransported themselves and their belongings, amid the awestruck wonderand admiration of their fellow-squires.']"
82,25,Chapter 25,"['24In Myles Falworth\'s day one of the greatest ceremonies of courtly lifewas that of the bestowal of knighthood by the King, with the honors ofthe Bath. By far the greater number of knights were at that time createdby other knights, or by nobles, or by officers of the crown. To beknighted by the King in person distinguished the recipient for life. Itwas this signal honor that the Earl, for his own purposes, wished Mylesto enjoy, and for this end he had laid not a few plans.The accolade was the term used for the creation of a knight upon thefield of battle. It was a reward of valor or of meritorious service, andwas generally bestowed in a more or less off-hand way; but the ceremonyof the Bath was an occasion of the greatest courtly moment, and it wasthus that Myles Falworth was to be knighted in addition to the honor ofa royal belting.A quaint old book treating of knighthood and chivalry gives a full anddetailed account of all the circumstances of the ceremony of a creationof a Knight of the Bath. It tells us that the candidate was firstplaced under the care of two squires of honor, ""grave and well seen incourtship and nurture, and also in feats of chivalry,"" which same werelikewise to be governors in all things relating to the coming honors.First of all, the barber shaved him, and cut his hair in a certainpeculiar fashion ordained for the occasion, the squires of honorsupervising the operation. This being concluded, the candidate wassolemnly conducted to the chamber where the bath of tepid water wasprepared, ""hung within and without with linen, and likewise coveredwith rich cloths and embroidered linen."" While in the bath two ""ancient,grave, and reverend knights"" attended the bachelor, giving him ""meetinstructions in the order and feats of chivalry."" The candidate was thenexamined as to his knowledge and acquirements, and then, all questionsbeing answered to the satisfaction of his examiners, the elder of thetwo dipped a handful of water out from the bath, and poured it upon hishead, at the same time signing his left shoulder with the sign of thecross.As soon as this ceremony was concluded, the two squires of honor helpedtheir charge from the bath, and conducted him to a plain bed withouthangings, where they let him rest until his body was warm and dry.Then they clad him in a white linen shirt, and over it a plain robe ofrusset, ""girdled about the loins with a rope, and having a hood likeunto a hermit.""As soon as the candidate had arisen, the two ""ancient knights"" returned,and all being in readiness he was escorted to the chapel, the twowalking, one upon either side of him, his squires of honor marchingbefore, and the whole party preceded by ""sundry minstrels making a loudnoise of music.""When they came to the chapel, the two knights who escorted him tookleave of the candidate, each saluting him with a kiss upon the cheek.No one remained with him but his squires of honor, the priest, and thechandler.In the mean time the novitiate\'s armor, sword, lance, and helmet hadbeen laid in readiness before the altar. These he watched and guardedwhile the others slept, keeping vigil until sunrise, during which time""he shall,"" says the ancient authority, ""pass the night in orisons,prayers, and meditation."" At daylight he confessed to the priest, heardmatins, and communicated in mass, and then presented a lighted candleat the altar, with a piece of money stuck in it as close to the flameas could be done, the candle being offered to the honor of God, and themoney to the honor of that person who was to make him a knight.So concluded the sacred ceremony, which being ended his squiresconducted the candidate to his chamber, and there made him comfortable,and left him to repose for a while before the second and final part ofthe ordinance.Such is a shortened account of the preparatory stages of the ceremoniesthrough which Myles Falworth passed.Matters had come upon him so suddenly one after the other, and had comewith such bewildering rapidity that all that week was to him like somestrange, wonderful, mysterious vision. He went through it all like onein a dream. Lord George Beaumont was one of his squires of honor; theother, by way of a fitting complement to the courage of the chivalrouslad, was the Sieur de la Montaigne, his opponent soon to be. They werewell versed in everything relating to knightcraft, and Myles followedall their directions with passive obedience. Then Sir James Lee and theComte de Vermoise administered the ceremony of the Bath, the old knightexamining him in the laws of chivalry.It occurs perhaps once or twice in one\'s lifetime that one passesthrough great happenings--sometimes of joy, sometimes of dreadfulbitterness--in just such a dazed state as Myles passed through this. Itis only afterwards that all comes back to one so sharply and keenly thatthe heart thrills almost in agony in living it over again. But perhapsof all the memory of that time, when it afterwards came back piece bypiece, none was so clear to Myles\'s back-turned vision as the longnight spent in the chapel, watching his armor, thinking such wonderfulthoughts, and dreaming such wonderful wide-eyed dreams. At such timesMyles saw again the dark mystery of the castle chapel; he saw again thehalf-moon gleaming white and silvery through the tall, narrow window,and throwing a broad form of still whiteness across stone floor, emptyseats, and still, motionless figures of stone effigies. At such timeshe stood again in front of the twinkling tapers that lit the altar wherehis armor lay piled in a heap, heard again the deep breathing of hiscompanions of the watch sleeping in some empty stall, wrapped each inhis cloak, and saw the old chandler bestir himself, and rise and comeforward to snuff the candles. At such times he saw again the day growingclearer and clearer through the tall, glazed windows, saw it change toa rosy pink, and then to a broad, ruddy glow that threw a halo of lightaround Father Thomas\'s bald head bowed in sleep, and lit up the bannersand trophies hanging motionless against the stony face of the west wall;heard again the stirring of life without and the sound of his companionsarousing themselves; saw them come forward, and heard them wish him joythat his long watch was ended.It was nearly noon when Myles was awakened from a fitful sleep byGascoyne bringing in his dinner, but, as might be supposed, he had butlittle hunger, and ate sparingly. He had hardly ended his frugal mealbefore his two squires of honor came in, followed by a servant carryingthe garments for the coming ceremony. He saluted them gravely, and thenarising, washed his face and hands in a basin which Gascoyne held; thenkneeled in prayer, the others standing silent at a little distance. Ashe arose, Lord George came forward.""The King and the company come presently to the Great Hall, Myles,"" saidhe; ""it is needful for thee to make all the haste that thou art able.""Perhaps never had Devlen Castle seen a more brilliant and goodly companygathered in the great hall than that which came to witness King Henrycreate Myles Falworth a knight bachelor.At the upper end of the hall was a raised dais, upon which stooda throne covered with crimson satin and embroidered with lions andflower-deluces; it was the King\'s seat. He and his personal attendantshad not yet come, but the rest of the company were gathered. The daybeing warm and sultry, the balcony was all aflutter with the featherfans of the ladies of the family and their attendants, who from thishigh place looked down upon the hall below. Up the centre of the hallwas laid a carpet of arras, and the passage was protected by woodenrailings. Upon the one side were tiers of seats for the castlegentlefolks and the guests. Upon the other stood the burghers from thetown, clad in sober dun and russet, and yeomanry in green and brown. Thewhole of the great vaulted hall was full of the dull hum of many peoplewaiting, and a ceaseless restlessness stirred the crowded throng. Butat last a whisper went around that the King was coming. A momentary hushfell, and through it was heard the noisy clatter of horses\' feet comingnearer and nearer, and then stopping before the door. The sudden blareof trumpets broke through the hush; another pause, and then in throughthe great door-way of the hall came the royal procession.First of all marched, in the order of their rank, and to the number ofa score or more, certain gentlemen, esquires and knights, chosen mostlyfrom the King\'s attendants. Behind these came two pursuivants-at-armsin tabards, and following them a party of a dozen more banneretsand barons. Behind these again, a little space intervening, came twoheralds, also in tabards, a group of the greater nobles attendantupon the King following in the order of their rank. Next came theKing-at-arms and, at a little distance and walking with sober slowness,the King himself, with the Earl and the Count directly attendant uponhim--the one marching upon the right hand and the other upon the left.A breathless silence filled the whole space as the royal processionadvanced slowly up the hall. Through the stillness could be heard themuffled sound of the footsteps on the carpet, the dry rustling ofsilk and satin garments, and the clear clink and jingle of chains andjewelled ornaments, but not the sound of a single voice.After the moment or two of bustle and confusion of the King taking hisplace had passed, another little space of expectant silence fell. Atlast there suddenly came the noise of acclamation of those who stoodwithout the door--cheering and the clapping of hands--sounds heraldingthe immediate advent of Myles and his attendants. The next moment thelittle party entered the hall.First of all, Gascoyne, bearing Myles\'s sword in both hands, the hiltresting against his breast, the point elevated at an angle of forty-fivedegrees. It was sheathed in a crimson scabbard, and the belt of Spanishleather studded with silver bosses was wound crosswise around it. Fromthe hilt of the sword dangled the gilt spurs of his coming knighthood.At a little distance behind his squire followed Myles, the centre ofall observation. He was clad in a novitiate dress, arranged under LordGeorge\'s personal supervision. It had been made somewhat differentlyfrom the fashion usual at such times, and was intended to indicate in amanner the candidate\'s extreme youthfulness and virginity in arms. Theouter garment was a tabard robe of white wool, embroidered at the hemwith fine lines of silver, and gathered loosely at the waist with a beltof lavender leather stitched with thread of silver. Beneath he was cladin armor (a present from the Earl), new and polished till it shone withdazzling brightness, the breastplate covered with a juppon of whitesatin, embroidered with silver. Behind Myles, and upon either hand, camehis squires of honor, sponsors, and friends--a little company ofsome half-dozen in all. As they advanced slowly up the great, dim,high-vaulted room, the whole multitude broke forth into a humming buzzof applause. Then a sudden clapping of hands began near the door-way,ran down through the length of the room, and was taken up by all withnoisy clatter.""Saw I never youth so comely,"" whispered one of the Lady Anne\'sattendant gentlewomen. ""Sure he looketh as Sir Galahad looked when hecame first to King Arthur\'s court.""Myles knew that he was very pale; he felt rather than saw the restlesscrowd of faces upon either side, for his eyes were fixed directly beforehim, upon the dais whereon sat the King, with the Earl of Mackworthstanding at his right hand, the Comte de Vermoise upon the left, and theothers ranged around and behind the throne. It was with the same tensefeeling of dreamy unreality that Myles walked slowly up the length ofthe hall, measuring his steps by those of Gascoyne. Suddenly hefelt Lord George Beaumont touch him lightly upon the arm, and almostinstinctively he stopped short--he was standing just before the coveredsteps of the throne.He saw Gascoyne mount to the third step, stop short, kneel, and offerthe sword and the spurs he carried to the King, who took the weaponand laid it across his knees. Then the squire bowed low, and walkingbackward withdrew to one side, leaving Myles standing alone facing thethrone. The King unlocked the spur chains from the sword-hilt, andthen, holding the gilt spurs in his hand for a moment, he looked Mylesstraight in the eyes and smiled. Then he turned, and gave one of thespurs to the Earl of Mackworth.The Earl took it with a low bow, turned, and came slowly down the stepsto where Myles stood. Kneeling upon one knee, and placing Myles\'s footupon the other, Lord Mackworth set the spur in its place and latched thechain over the instep. He drew the sign of the cross upon Myles\'s bendedknee, set the foot back upon the ground, rose with slow dignity, andbowing to the King, drew a little to one side.As soon as the Earl had fulfilled his office the King gave the secondspur to the Comte de Vermoise, who set it to Myles\'s other foot with thesame ceremony that the Earl had observed, withdrawing as he had done toone side.An instant pause of motionless silence followed, and then the Kingslowly arose, and began deliberately to unwind the belt from around thescabbard of the sword he held. As soon as he stood, the Earl and theCount advanced, and taking Myles by either hand, led him forward and upthe steps of the dais to the platform above. As they drew a little toone side, the King stooped and buckled the sword-belt around Myles\'swaist, then, rising again, lifted his hand and struck him upon theshoulder, crying, in a loud voice.""Be thou a good knight!""Instantly a loud sound of applause and the clapping of hands filled thewhole hall, in the midst of which the King laid both hands upon Myles\'sshoulders and kissed him upon the right cheek. So the ceremony ended;Myles was no longer Myles Falworth, but Sir Myles Falworth, Knight byOrder of the Bath and by grace of the King!']"
82,26,Chapter 26,"['25It was the custom to conclude the ceremonies of the bestowal ofknighthood by a grand feast given in honor of the newly-created knight.But in Myles\'s instance the feast was dispensed with. The Earl ofMackworth had planned that Myles might be created a Knight of the Bathwith all possible pomp and ceremony; that his personality might bemost favorably impressed upon the King; that he might be so honorablyknighted as to make him the peer of any who wore spurs in all England;and, finally, that he might celebrate his new honors by jousting withsome knight of high fame and approved valor. All these desiderata chancehad fulfilled in the visit of the King to Devlen.As the Earl had said to Myles, he would rather have waited a littlewhile longer until the lad was riper in years and experience, but theopportunity was not to be lost. Young as he was, Myles must takehis chances against the years and grim experience of the Sieur de laMontaigne. But it was also a part of the Earl\'s purpose that the Kingand Myles should not be brought too intimately together just at thattime. Though every particular of circumstance should be fulfilled in theceremony, it would have been ruination to the Earl\'s plans to have theknowledge come prematurely to the King that Myles was the son ofthe attainted Lord Falworth. The Earl knew that Myles was a shrewd,coolheaded lad; but the King had already hinted that the name wasfamiliar to his ears, and a single hasty answer or unguarded speech uponthe young knight\'s part might awaken him to a full knowledge. Such amishap was, of all things, to be avoided just then, for, thanks to themachinations of that enemy of his father of whom Myles had heard somuch, and was soon to hear more, the King had always retained and stillheld a bitter and rancorous enmity against the unfortunate nobleman.It was no very difficult matter for the Earl to divert the King\'sattention from the matter of the feast. His Majesty was very intentjust then upon supplying a quota of troops to the Dauphin, and the chiefobject of his visit to Devlen was to open negotiations with the Earllooking to that end. He was interested--much interested in Myles and inthe coming jousting in which the young warrior was to prove himself, buthe was interested in it by way of a relaxation from the other and moreengrossing matter. So, though he made some passing and half preoccupiedinquiry about the feast he was easily satisfied with the Earl\'s reasonsfor not holding it: which were that he had arranged a consultation forthat morning in regard to the troops for the Dauphin, to which meetinghe had summoned a number of his own more important dependent nobles,that the King himself needed repose and the hour or so of rest thathis barber-surgeon had ordered him to take after his mid-day meal; thatFather Thomas had laid upon Myles a petty penance--that for the firstthree days of his knighthood he should eat his meals without meat andin his own apartment--and various other reasons equally good andsufficient. So the King was satisfied, and the feast was dispensed with.The next morning had been set for the jousting, and all that day theworkmen were busy erecting the lists in the great quadrangle upon which,as was said before, looked the main buildings of the castle. The windowsof Myles\'s apartment opened directly upon the bustling scene--thecarpenters hammering and sawing, the upholsterers snipping, cutting,and tacking. Myles and Gascoyne stood gazing out from the open casement,with their arms lying across one another\'s shoulders in the old boyhoodfashion, and Myles felt his heart shrink with a sudden tight pang asthe realization came sharply and vividly upon him that all thesepreparations were being made for him, and that the next day he should,with almost the certainty of death, meet either glory or failure underthe eyes not only of all the greater and lesser castle folk, but of theKing himself and noble strangers critically used to deeds of chivalryand prowess. Perhaps he had never fully realized the magnitude of thereality before. In that tight pang at his heart he drew a deep breath,almost a sigh. Gascoyne turned his head abruptly, and looked at hisfriend, but he did not ask the cause of the sigh. No doubt the samethoughts that were in Myles\'s mind were in his also.It was towards the latter part of the afternoon that a message came fromthe Earl, bidding Myles attend him in his private closet. After Myleshad bowed and kissed his lordship\'s hand, the Earl motioned him totake a seat, telling him that he had some final words to say that mightoccupy a considerable time. He talked to the young man for about halfan hour in his quiet, measured voice, only now and then showing a littleagitation by rising and walking up and down the room for a turn or two.Very many things were disclosed in that talk that had caused Myleslong hours of brooding thought, for the Earl spoke freely, and withoutconcealment to him concerning his father and the fortunes of the houseof Falworth.Myles had surmised many things, but it was not until then that he knewfor a certainty who was his father\'s malignant and powerful enemy--thatit was the great Earl of Alban, the rival and bitter enemy of the Earlof Mackworth. It was not until then that he knew that the present Earlof Alban was the Lord Brookhurst, who had killed Sir John Dale inthe anteroom at Falworth Castle that morning so long ago in his earlychildhood. It was not until then that he knew all the circumstances ofhis father\'s blindness; that he had been overthrown in the melee at thegreat tournament at York, and that that same Lord Brookhurst had riddenhis iron-shod war-horse twice over his enemy\'s prostrate body before hissquire could draw him from the press, and had then and there given himthe wound from which he afterwards went blind. The Earl swore to Mylesthat Lord Brookhurst had done what he did wilfully, and had afterwardsboasted of it. Then, with some hesitation, he told Myles the reasonof Lord Brookhurst\'s enmity, and that it had arisen on account of LadyFalworth, whom he had one time sought in marriage, and that he had swornvengeance against the man who had won her.Piece by piece the Earl of Mackworth recounted every circumstance anddetail of the revenge that the blind man\'s enemy had afterwardswreaked upon him. He told Myles how, when his father was attaintedof high-treason, and his estates forfeited to the crown, the King hadgranted the barony of Easterbridge to the then newly-created Earl ofAlban in spite of all the efforts of Lord Falworth\'s friends to thecontrary; that when he himself had come out from an audience with theKing, with others of his father\'s friends, the Earl of Alban had boastedin the anteroom, in a loud voice, evidently intended for them all tohear, that now that he had Falworth\'s fat lands, he would never resttill he had hunted the blind man out from his hiding, and brought hishead to the block.""Ever since then,"" said the Earl of Mackworth ""he hath been striving byevery means to discover thy father\'s place of concealment. Some time,haply, he may find it, and then--""Myles had felt for a long time that he was being moulded and shaped, andthat the Earl of Mackworth\'s was the hand that was making him what hewas growing to be; but he had never realized how great were the thingsexpected of him should he pass the first great test, and show himselfwhat his friends hoped to see him. Now he knew that all were lookingupon him to act, sometime, as his father\'s champion, and when that timeshould come, to challenge the Earl of Alban to the ordeal of singlecombat, to purge his father\'s name of treason, to restore him to hisrank, and to set the house of Falworth where it stood before misfortunefell upon it.But it was not alone concerning his and his father\'s affairs that theEarl of Mackworth talked to Myles. He told him that the Earl of Albanwas the Earl of Mackworth\'s enemy also; that in his younger days he hadhelped Lord Falworth, who was his kinsman, to win his wife, and thatthen, Lord Brookhurst had sworn to compass his ruin as he had swornto compass the ruin of his friend. He told Myles how, now that LordBrookhurst was grown to be Earl of Alban, and great and powerful, hewas forever plotting against him, and showed Myles how, if Lord Falworthwere discovered and arrested for treason, he also would be likely tosuffer for aiding and abetting him. Then it dawned upon Myles that theEarl looked to him to champion the house of Beaumont as well as that ofFalworth.""Mayhap,"" said the Earl, ""thou didst think that it was all for thepleasant sport of the matter that I have taken upon me this toil andendeavor to have thee knighted with honor that thou mightst fight theDauphiny knight. Nay, nay, Myles Falworth, I have not labored sohard for such a small matter as that. I have had the King, unknown tohimself, so knight thee that thou mayst be the peer of Alban himself,and now I would have thee to hold thine own with the Sieur de laMontaigne, to try whether thou be\'st Alban\'s match, and to approvethyself worthy of the honor of thy knighthood. I am sorry, ne\'theless,""he added, after a moment\'s pause, ""that this could not have been put offfor a while longer, for my plans for bringing thee to battle with thatvile Alban are not yet ripe. But such a chance of the King coming hitherhaps not often. And then I am glad of this much--that a good occasionoffers to get thee presently away from England. I would have thee outof the King\'s sight so soon as may be after this jousting. He taketha liking to thee, and I fear me lest he should inquire more nearlyconcerning thee and so all be discovered and spoiled. My brother Georgegoeth upon the first of next month to France to take service with theDauphin, having under his command a company of tenscore men--knights andarchers; thou shalt go with him, and there stay till I send for thee toreturn.""With this, the protracted interview concluded, the Earl charging Mylesto say nothing further about the French expedition for the present--evento his friend--for it was as yet a matter of secrecy, known only to theKing and a few nobles closely concerned in the venture.Then Myles arose to take his leave. He asked and obtained permission forGascoyne to accompany him to France. Then he paused for a moment or two,for it was strongly upon him to speak of a matter that had been lyingin his mind all day--a matter that he had dreamed of much with open eyesduring the long vigil of the night before.The Earl looked up inquiringly. ""What is it thou wouldst ask?"" said he.Myles\'s heart was beating quickly within him at the thought of his ownboldness, and as he spoke his cheeks burned like fire. ""Sir,"" said he,mustering his courage at last, ""haply thou hast forgot it, but I havenot; ne\'theless, a long time since when I spoke of serving the--the LadyAlice as her true knight, thou didst wisely laugh at my words, and bademe wait first till I had earned my spurs. But now, sir, I have gottenmy spurs, and--and do now crave thy gracious leave that I may serve thatlady as her true knight.""A space of dead silence fell, in which Myles\'s heart beat tumultuouslywithin him.""I know not what thou meanest,"" said the Earl at last, in a somewhatconstrained voice. ""How wouldst thou serve her? What wouldst thou have?""""I would have only a little matter just now,"" answered Myles. ""I wouldbut crave of her a favor for to wear in the morrow\'s battle, so that shemay know that I hold her for my own true lady, and that I may have thecourage to fight more boldly, having that favor to defend.""The Earl sat looking at him for a while in brooding silence, strokinghis beard the while. Suddenly his brow cleared. ""So be it,"" said he.""I grant thee my leave to ask the Lady Alice for a favor, and if sheis pleased to give it to thee, I shall not say thee nay. But I set thisupon thee as a provision: that thou shalt not see her without the LadyAnne be present. Thus it was, as I remember, thou saw her first, andwith it thou must now be satisfied. Go thou to the Long Gallery, andthither they will come anon if naught hinder them.""Myles waited in the Long Gallery perhaps some fifteen or twenty minutes.No one was there but himself. It was a part of the castle connecting theEarl\'s and the Countess\'s apartments, and was used but little. Duringthat time he stood looking absently out of the open casement into thestony court-yard beyond, trying to put into words that which he hadto say; wondering, with anxiety, how soon the young ladies would come;wondering whether they would come at all. At last the door at thefarther end of the gallery opened, and turning sharply at the sound, hesaw the two young ladies enter, Lady Alice leaning upon Lady Anne\'s arm.It was the first time that he had seen them since the ceremony of themorning, and as he advanced to meet them, the Lady Anne came franklyforward, and gave him her hand, which Myles raised to his lips.""I give thee joy of thy knighthood, Sir Myles,"" said she, ""and dobelieve, in good sooth, that if any one deserveth such an honor, thouart he.""At first little Lady Alice hung back behind her cousin, saying nothinguntil the Lady Anne, turning suddenly, said: ""Come, coz, has thou naughtto say to our new-made knight? Canst thou not also wish him joy of hisknighthood?""Lady Alice hesitated a minute, then gave Myles a timid hand, which he,with a strange mixture of joy and confusion, took as timidly as it wasoffered. He raised the hand, and set it lightly and for an instantto his lips, as he had done with the Lady Anne\'s hand, but with verydifferent emotions.""I give you joy of your knighthood, sir,"" said Lady Alice, in a voice solow that Myles could hardly hear it.Both flushed red, and as he raised his head again, Myles saw that theLady Anne had withdrawn to one side. Then he knew that it was to givehim the opportunity to proffer his request.A little space of silence followed, the while he strove to key hiscourage to the saying of that which lay at his mind. ""Lady,"" said he atlast, and then again--""Lady, I--have a favor for to ask thee.""""What is it thou wouldst have, Sir Myles?"" she murmured, in reply.""Lady,"" said he, ""ever sin I first saw thee I have thought that if Imight choose of all the world, thou only wouldst I choose for--formy true lady, to serve as a right knight should."" Here he stopped,frightened at his own boldness. Lady Alice stood quite still, with herface turned away. ""Thou--thou art not angered at what I say?"" he said.She shook her head.""I have longed and longed for the time,"" said he, ""to ask a boon of thee,and now hath that time come. Lady, to-morrow I go to meet a right goodknight, and one skilled in arms and in jousting, as thou dost know. Yea,he is famous in arms, and I be nobody. Ne\'theless, I fight for the honorof England and Mackworth--and--and for thy sake. I--Thou art not angeredat what I say?""Again the Lady Alice shook her head.""I would that thou--I would that thou would give me some favor for towear--thy veil or thy necklace.""He waited anxiously for a little while, but Lady Alice did not answerimmediately.""I fear me,"" said Myles, presently, ""that I have in sooth offended theein asking this thing. I know that it is a parlous bold matter for one soraw in chivalry and in courtliness as I am, and one so poor in rank, toask thee for thy favor. An I ha\' offended, I prithee let it be as thoughI had not asked it.""Perhaps it was the young man\'s timidity that brought a sudden courage toLady Alice; perhaps it was the graciousness of her gentle breeding thaturged her to relieve Myles\'s somewhat awkward humility, perhaps it wassomething more than either that lent her bravery to speak, even knowingthat the Lady Anne heard all. She turned quickly to him: ""Nay, SirMyles,"" she said, ""I am foolish, and do wrong thee by my foolishnessand silence, for, truly, I am proud to have thee wear my favor."" Sheunclasped, as she spoke, the thin gold chain from about her neck. ""Igive thee this chain,"" said she, ""and it will bring me joy to have ithonored by thy true knightliness, and, giving it, I do wish thee allsuccess."" Then she bowed her head, and, turning, left him holding thenecklace in his hand.Her cousin left the window to meet her, bowing her head with a smileto Myles as she took her cousin\'s arm again and led her away. He stoodlooking after them as they left the room, and when they were gone, heraised the necklace to his lips with a heart beating tumultuously with atriumphant joy it had never felt before.']"
82,27,Chapter 27,"['26And now, at last, had come the day of days for Myles Falworth; the daywhen he was to put to the test all that he had acquired in the threeyears of his training, the day that was to disclose what promise offuture greatness there was in his strong young body. And it was a nobleday; one of those of late September, when the air seems sweeter andfresher than at other times; the sun bright and as yellow as gold, thewind lusty and strong, before which the great white clouds go sailingmajestically across the bright blueness of the sky above, while theirdusky shadows skim across the brown face of the rusty earth beneath.As was said before, the lists had been set up in the great quadrangleof the castle, than which, level and smooth as a floor, no more fittingplace could be chosen. The course was of the usual size--sixty paceslong--and separated along its whole length by a barrier about five feethigh. Upon the west side of the course and about twenty paces distantfrom it, a scaffolding had been built facing towards the east so as toavoid the glare of the afternoon sun. In the centre was a raised dais,hung round with cloth of blue embroidered with lions rampant. Upon thedais stood a cushioned throne for the King, and upon the steps below,ranged in the order of their dignity, were seats for the Earl, hisguests, the family, the ladies, knights, and gentlemen of the castle.In front, the scaffolding was covered with the gayest tapestries andbrightest-colored hangings that the castle could afford. And above,parti-colored pennants and streamers, surmounted by the royal ensign ofEngland, waved and fluttered in the brisk wind.At either end of the lists stood the pavilions of the knights. That ofMyles was at the southern extremity and was hung, by the Earl\'s desire,with cloth of the Beaumont colors (black and yellow), while a woodenshield bearing three goshawks spread (the crest of the house) was nailedto the roof, and a long streamer of black and yellow trailed out in thewind from the staff above. Myles, partly armed, stood at the door-way ofthe pavilion, watching the folk gathering at the scaffolding. The ladiesof the house were already seated, and the ushers were bustling hitherand thither, assigning the others their places. A considerable crowdof common folk and burghers from the town had already gathered atthe barriers opposite, and as he looked at the restless and growingmultitude he felt his heart beat quickly and his flesh grow cold with anervous trepidation--just such as the lad of to-day feels when he seesthe auditorium filling with friends and strangers who are to listenby-and-by to the reading of his prize poem.Suddenly there came a loud blast of trumpets. A great gate at thefarther extremity of the lists was thrown open, and the King appeared,riding upon a white horse, preceded by the King-at-arms and the heralds,attended by the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise, and followed by a crowdof attendants. Just then Gascoyne, who, with Wilkes, was busied lacingsome of the armor plates with new thongs, called Myles, and he turnedand entered the pavilion.As the two squires were adjusting these last pieces, strapping them inplace and tying the thongs, Lord George and Sir James Lee enteredthe pavilion. Lord George took the young man by the hand, and with apleasant smile wished him success in the coming encounter.Sir James seemed anxious and disturbed. He said nothing, and afterGascoyne had placed the open bascinet that supports the tilting helmin its place, he came forward and examined the armor piece by piece,carefully and critically, testing the various straps and leather pointsand thongs to make sure of their strength.""Sir,"" said Gascoyne, who stood by watching him anxiously, ""I do trustthat I have done all meetly and well.""""I see nothing amiss, sirrah,"" said the old knight, half grudgingly. ""Sofar as I may know, he is ready to mount.""Just then a messenger entered, saying that the King was seated, and LordGeorge bade Myles make haste to meet the challenger.""Francis,"" said Myles, ""prithee give me my pouch yonder.""Gascoyne handed him the velvet bag, and he opened it, and took out thenecklace that the Lady Alice had given him the day before.""Tie me this around my arm,"" said he. He looked down, keeping his eyesstudiously fixed on Gascoyne\'s fingers, as they twined the thin goldenchain around the iron plates of his right arm, knowing that LordGeorge\'s eyes were upon him, and blushing fiery red at the knowledge.Sir James was at that moment examining the great tilting helm, and LordGeorge watched him, smiling amusedly. ""And hast thou then already chosenthee a lady?"" he said, presently.""Aye, my Lord,"" answered Myles, simply.""Marry, I trust we be so honored that she is one of our castle folk,""said the Earl\'s brother.For a moment Myles did not reply; then he looked up. ""My Lord,"" said he,""the favor was given to me by the Lady Alice.""Lord George looked grave for the moment; then he laughed. ""Marry, thouart a bold archer to shoot for such high game.""Myles did not answer, and at that moment two grooms led his horse up tothe door of the pavilion. Gascoyne and Wilkes helped him to his saddle,and then, Gascoyne holding his horse by the bridle-rein, he rode slowlyacross the lists to the little open space in front of the scaffoldingand the King\'s seat just as the Sieur de la Montaigne approached fromthe opposite direction.As soon as the two knights champion had reached each his appointedstation in front of the scaffolding, the Marshal bade the speaker readthe challenge, which, unrolling the parchment, he began to do in a loud,clear voice, so that all might hear. It was a quaint document, wrappedup in the tangled heraldic verbiage of the time.The pith of the matter was that the Sieur Brian Philip Francis de laMontaigne proclaimed before all men the greater chivalry and skill atarms of the knights of France and of Dauphiny, and likewise the greaterfairness of the ladies of France and Dauphiny, and would there defendthose sayings with his body without fear or attaint as to the truth ofthe same. As soon as the speaker had ended, the Marshal bade him callthe defendant of the other side.Then Myles spoke his part, with a voice trembling somewhat with theexcitement of the moment, but loudly and clearly enough: ""I, MylesEdward Falworth, knight, so created by the hand and by the grace ofhis Majesty King Henry IV of England, do take upon me the gage of thisbattle, and will defend with my body the chivalry of the knights ofEngland and the fairness of the ladies thereof!""Then, after the speaker ended his proclamation and had retired to hisplace, the ceremony of claiming and redeeming the helmet, to whichall young knights were subjected upon first entering the lists, wasperformed.One of the heralds cried in a loud voice, ""I, Gilles Hamerton, herald tothe most noble Clarencieux King-at-arms, do claim the helm of Sir MylesEdward Falworth by this reason, that he hath never yet entered joust ortourney.""To which Myles answered, ""I do acknowledge the right of that claim, andherewith proffer thee in ransom for the same this purse of one hundredmarks in gold.""As he spoke, Gascoyne stepped forward and delivered the purse, with themoney, to the Herald. It was a more than usually considerable ransom,and had been made up by the Earl and Lord George that morning.""Right nobly hast thou redeemed thy helm,"" said the Herald, ""andhereafter be thou free to enter any jousting whatsoever, and in whateverplace.""So, all being ended, both knights bowed to the King, and then, escortedeach by his squire, returned to his pavilion, saluted by the spectatorswith a loud clapping of hands.Sir James Lee met Myles in front of his tent. Coming up to the side ofthe horse, the old man laid his hand upon the saddle, looking up intothe young man\'s face.""Thou wilt not fail in this venture and bring shame upon me?"" said he.""Nay, my dear master,"" said Myles; ""I will do my best.""""I doubt it not,"" said the old man; ""and I believe me thou wilt come offright well. From what he did say this morning, methinks the Sieur de laMontaigne meaneth only to break three lances with thee, and will contenthimself therewith, without seeking to unhorse thee. Ne\'theless, be thoubold and watchful, and if thou find that he endeavor to cast thee, dothy best to unhorse him. Remember also those things which I have toldthee ten thousand times before: hold thy toes well down and grip thestirrup hard, more especially at the moment of meeting; bend thy bodyforward, and keep thine elbow close to thy side. Bear thy lance pointone foot above thine adversary\'s helm until within two lengths ofmeeting, and strike thou in the very middle of his shield. So, Myles,thou mayst hold thine own, and come off with glory.""As he ended speaking he drew back, and Gascoyne, mounting upon a stool,covered his friend\'s head and bascinet with the great jousting helm,making fast the leathern points that held it to the iron collar.As he was tying the last thong a messenger came from the Herald, sayingthat the challenger was ready, and then Myles knew the time had come,and reaching down and giving Sir James a grip of the hand, he drew onhis gauntlet, took the jousting lance that Wilkes handed him, and turnedhis horse\'s head towards his end of the lists.']"
82,28,Chapter 28,"['27As Myles took his place at the south end of the lists, he found theSieur de la Montaigne already at his station. Through the peep-hole inthe face of the huge helmet, a transverse slit known as the occularium,he could see, like a strange narrow picture, the farther end ofthe lists, the spectators upon either side moving and shifting withceaseless restlessness, and in the centre of all, his opponent, sittingwith spear point directed upward, erect, motionless as a statue of iron,the sunlight gleaming and flashing upon his polished plates of steel,and the trappings of his horse swaying and fluttering in the rushing ofthe fresh breeze.Upon that motionless figure his sight gradually centred with everyfaculty of mind and soul. He knew the next moment the signal would begiven that was to bring him either glory or shame from that iron statue.He ground his teeth together with stern resolve to do his best in thecoming encounter, and murmured a brief prayer in the hallow darkness ofhis huge helm. Then with a shake he settled himself more firmly in hissaddle, slowly raised his spear point until the shaft reached the exactangle, and there suffered it to rest motionless. There was a moment ofdead, tense, breathless pause, then he rather felt than saw the Marshalraise his baton. He gathered himself together, and the next moment abugle sounded loud and clear. In one blinding rush he drove his spursinto the sides of his horse, and in instant answer felt the noble steedspring forward with a bound.Through all the clashing of his armor reverberating in the hollow depthsof his helmet, he saw the mail-clad figure from the other end of thelists rushing towards him, looming larger and larger as they cametogether. He gripped his saddle with his knees, clutched the stirrupwith the soles of his feet, and bent his body still more forward. In theinstant of meeting, with almost the blindness of instinct, he droppedthe point of his spear against the single red flower-de-luce in themiddle of the on-coming shield. There was a thunderous crash that seemedto rack every joint, he heard the crackle of splintered wood, he feltthe momentary trembling recoil of the horse beneath him, and in the nextinstant had passed by. As he checked the onward rush of his horse at thefar end of the course, he heard faintly in the dim hollow recess of thehelm the loud shout and the clapping of hands of those who looked on,and found himself gripping with nervous intensity the butt of a brokenspear, his mouth clammy with excitement, and his heart thumping in histhroat.Then he realized that he had met his opponent, and had borne the meetingwell. As he turned his horse\'s head towards his own end of the lists, hesaw the other trotting slowly back towards his station, also holding abroken spear shaft in his hand.As he passed the iron figure a voice issued from the helmet, ""Well done,Sir Myles, nobly done!"" and his heart bounded in answer to the words ofpraise. When he had reached his own end of the lists, he flung away hisbroken spear, and Gascoyne came forward with another.""Oh, Myles!"" he said, with sob in his voice, ""it was nobly done. Neverdid I see a better ridden course in all my life. I did not believe thatthou couldst do half so well. Oh, Myles, prithee knock him out of hissaddle an thou lovest me!""Myles, in his high-keyed nervousness, could not forbear a shorthysterical laugh at his friend\'s warmth of enthusiasm. He took the freshlance in his hand, and then, seeing that his opponent was walking hishorse slowly up and down at his end of the lists, did the same duringthe little time of rest before the next encounter.When, in answer to the command of the Marshal, he took his place asecond time, he found himself calmer and more collected than before, butevery faculty no less intensely fixed than it had been at first. Oncemore the Marshal raised his baton, once more the horn sounded, and oncemore the two rushed together with the same thunderous crash, the samesplinter of broken spears, the same momentary trembling recoil ofthe horse, and the same onward rush past one another. Once more thespectators applauded and shouted as the two knights turned their horsesand rode back towards their station.This time as they met midway the Sieur de la Montaigne reined in hishorse. ""Sir Myles,"" said his muffled voice, ""I swear to thee, by myfaith, I had not thought to meet in thee such an opponent as thou dostprove thyself to be. I had thought to find in thee a raw boy, but findinstead a Paladin. Hitherto I have given thee grace as I wouldgive grace to any mere lad, and thought of nothing but to give theeopportunity to break thy lance. Now I shall do my endeavor to unhorsethee as I would an acknowledged peer in arms. Nevertheless, on accountof thy youth, I give thee this warning, so that thou mayst hold thyselfin readiness.""""I give thee gramercy for thy courtesy, my Lord,"" answered Myles,speaking in French; ""and I will strive to encounter thee as best I may,and pardon me if I seem forward in so saying, but were I in thy place,my Lord, I would change me yon breast-piece and over-girth of my saddle;they are sprung in the stitches.""""Nay,"" said the Sieur de la Montaigne, laughing, ""breast-piece andover-girth have carried me through more tilts than one, and shallthrough this. An thou give me a blow so true as to burst breast-pieceand over-girth, I will own myself fairly conquered by thee."" So saying,he saluted Myles with the butt of the spear he still held, and passed byto his end of the lists.Myles, with Gascoyne running beside him, rode across to his pavilion,and called to Edmund Wilkes to bring him a cup of spiced wine. AfterGascoyne had taken off his helmet, and as he sat wiping the perspirationfrom his face Sir James came up and took him by the hand.""My dear boy,"" said he, gripping the hand he held, ""never could I hopeto be so overjoyed in mine old age as I am this day. Thou dost bringhonor to me, for I tell thee truly thou dost ride like a knight seasonedin twenty tourneys.""""It doth give me tenfold courage to hear thee so say, dear master,""answered Myles. ""And truly,"" he added, ""I shall need all my couragethis bout, for the Sieur de la Montaigne telleth me that he will ride tounhorse me this time.""""Did he indeed so say?"" said Sir James. ""Then belike he meaneth tostrike at thy helm. Thy best chance is to strike also at his. Doth thyhand tremble?""""Not now,"" answered Myles.""Then keep thy head cool and thine eye true. Set thy trust in God, andhaply thou wilt come out of this bout honorably in spite of the rawnessof thy youth.""Just then Edmund Wilkes presented the cup of wine to Myles, who drank itoff at a draught, and thereupon Gascoyne replaced the helm and tied thethongs.The charge that Sir James Lee had given to Myles to strike at hisadversary\'s helm was a piece of advice he probably would not have givento so young a knight, excepting as a last resort. A blow perfectlydelivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for therecipient to recover from, but then a blow upon the helm was not onetime in fifty perfectly given. The huge cylindrical tilting helm was soconstructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to onepoint. That point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron bandswelded to the steel-face plates of the helm where it was weakened by theopening slit of the occularium, or peephole. In the very centre ofthis cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were rivetedtogether, and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be givento be perfect, and that stroke Myles determined to attempt.As he took his station Edmund Wilkes came running across from thepavilion with a lance that Sir James had chosen, and Myles, returningthe one that Gascoyne had just given him, took it in his hand. It wasof seasoned oak, somewhat thicker than the other, a tough weapon, noteasily to be broken even in such an encounter as he was like to have. Hebalanced the weapon, and found that it fitted perfectly to his grasp.As he raised the point to rest, his opponent took his station at thefarther extremity of the lists, and again there was a little space ofbreathless pause. Myles was surprised at his own coolness; every nervoustremor was gone. Before, he had been conscious of the critical multitudelooking down upon him; now it was a conflict of man to man, and such aconflict had no terrors for his young heart of iron.The spectators had somehow come to the knowledge that this was to bea more serious encounter than the two which had preceded it, and abreathless silence fell for the moment or two that the knights stood inplace.Once more he breathed a short prayer, ""Holy Mary, guard me!""Then again, for the third time, the Marshal raised his baton, and thehorn sounded, and for the third time Myles drove his spurs into hishorse\'s flanks. Again he saw the iron figure of his opponent rushingnearer, nearer, nearer. He centred, with a straining intensity, everyfaculty of soul, mind, and body upon one point--the cross of theoccularium, the mark he was to strike. He braced himself for thetremendous shock which he knew must meet him, and then in a flashdropped lance point straight and true. The next instant there was adeafening stunning crash--a crash like the stroke of a thunder-bolt.There was a dazzling blaze of blinding light, and a myriad sparks dancedand flickered and sparkled before his eyes. He felt his horse staggerunder him with the recoil, and hardly knowing what he did, he drovehis spurs deep into its sides with a shout. At the same moment thereresounded in his ears a crashing rattle and clatter, he knew not ofwhat, and then, as his horse recovered and sprang forward, and as thestunning bewilderment passed, he found that his helmet had beenstruck off. He heard a great shout arise from all, and thought, with asickening, bitter disappointment, that it was because he had lost. Atthe farther end of the course he turned his horse, and then his heartgave a leap and a bound as though it would burst, the blood leaped tohis cheeks tingling, and his bosom thrilled with an almost agonizingpang of triumph, of wonder, of amazement.There, in a tangle of his horse\'s harness and of embroidered trappings,the Sieur de la Montaigne lay stretched upon the ground, with his saddlenear by, and his riderless horse was trotting aimlessly about at thefarther end of the lists.Myles saw the two squires of the fallen knight run across to where theirmaster lay, he saw the ladies waving their kerchiefs and veils, and thecastle people swinging their hats and shouting in an ecstasy of delight.Then he rode slowly back to where the squires were now aiding the fallenknight to arise. The senior squire drew his dagger, cut the leatherpoints, and drew off the helm, disclosing the knight\'s face--a facewhite as death, and convulsed with rage, mortification, and bitterhumiliation.""I was not rightly unhorsed!"" he cried, hoarsely and with livid lips,to the Marshal and his attendants, who had ridden up. ""I unhelmed himfairly enough, but my over-girth and breast-strap burst, and my saddleslipped. I was not unhorsed, I say, and I lay claim that I unhelmedhim.""""Sir,"" said the Marshal calmly, and speaking in French, ""surely thouknowest that the loss of helmet does not decide an encounter. I need notremind thee, my Lord, that it was so awarded by John of Gaunt, Duke ofLancaster, when in the jousting match between Reynand de Roye and Johnde Holland, the Sieur Reynand left every point of his helm loosened, sothat the helm was beaten off at each stroke. If he then was justified indoing so of his own choice, and wilfully suffering to be unhelmed, howthen can this knight be accused of evil who suffered it by chance?""""Nevertheless,"" said the Sieur de la Montaigne, in the same hoarse,breathless voice, ""I do affirm, and will make my affirmation goodwith my body, that I fell only by the breaking of my girth. Who saysotherwise lies!""""It is the truth he speaketh,"" said Myles. ""I myself saw the stitcheswere some little what burst, and warned him thereof before we ran thiscourse.""Sir,"" said the Marshal to the Sieur de la Montaigne, ""how can you nowcomplain of that thing which your own enemy advised you of and warnedyou against? Was it not right knightly for him so to do?""The Sieur de la Montaigne stood quite still for a little while, leaningon the shoulder of his chief squire, looking moodily upon the ground;then, without making answer, he turned, and walked slowly away to hispavilion, still leaning on his squire\'s shoulder, whilst the otherattendant followed behind, bearing his shield and helmet.Gascoyne had picked up Myles\'s fallen helmet as the Sieur de laMontaigne moved away, and Lord George and Sir James Lee came walkingacross the lists to where Myles still sat. Then, the one taking hishorse by the bridle-rein, and the other walking beside the saddle, theyled him before the raised dais where the King sat.Even the Comte de Vermoise, mortified and amazed as he must have beenat the overthrow of his best knight, joined in the praise andcongratulation that poured upon the young conqueror. Myles, his heartswelling with a passion of triumphant delight, looked up and met thegaze of Lady Alice fixed intently upon him. A red spot of excitementstill burned in either cheek, and it flamed to a rosier red as he bowedhis head to her before turning away.Gascoyne had just removed Myles\'s breastplate and gorget, when Sir JamesLee burst into the pavilion. All his grim coldness was gone, and heflung his arms around the young man\'s neck, hugging him heartily, andkissing him upon either cheek.Ere he let him go, ""Mine own dear boy,"" he said, holding him off atarm\'s-length, and winking his one keen eye rapidly, as though to winkaway a dampness of which he was ashamed--""mine own dear boy, I do tellthee truly this is as sweet to me as though thou wert mine own son;sweeter to me than when I first broke mine own lance in triumph, andfelt myself to be a right knight.""""Sir,"" answered Myles, ""what thou sayest doth rejoice my very heart.Ne\'theless, it is but just to say that both his breast-piece andover-girth were burst in the stitches before he ran his course, for so Isaw with mine own eyes.""""Burst in the stitches!"" snorted Sir James. ""Thinkest thou he did notknow in what condition was his horse\'s gearing? I tell thee he went downbecause thou didst strike fair and true, and he did not so strike thee.Had he been Guy of Warwick he had gone down all the same under such astroke and in such case.""']"
82,29,Chapter 29,"['28It was not until more than three weeks after the King had left DevlenCastle that Lord George and his company of knights and archers wereready for the expedition to France. Two weeks of that time Myles spentat Crosbey-Dale with his father and mother. It was the first time thathe had seen them since, four years ago, he had quitted the low, narrow,white-walled farmhouse for the castle of the great Earl of Mackworth. Hehad never appreciated before how low and narrow and poor the farm-housewas. Now, with his eyes trained to the bigness of Devlen Castle,he looked around him with wonder and pity at his father\'s humblesurroundings. He realized as he never else could have realized how greatwas the fall in fortune that had cast the house of Falworth down fromits rightful station to such a level as that upon which it now rested.And at the same time that he thus recognized how poor was their lot, howdependent upon the charity of others, he also recognized how generouswas the friendship of Prior Edward, who perilled his own safety sogreatly in affording the family of the attainted Lord an asylum in itsbitter hour of need and peril.Myles paid many visits to the gentle old priest during those two weeks\'visit, and had many long and serious talks with him. One warm brightafternoon, as he and the old man walked together in the priory garden,after a game or two of draughts, the young knight talked more freely andopenly of his plans, his hopes, his ambitions, than perhaps he hadever done. He told the old man all that the Earl had disclosed to himconcerning the fallen fortunes of his father\'s house, and of how allwho knew those circumstances looked to him to set the family in its oldplace once more. Prior Edward added many things to those which Mylesalready knew--things of which the Earl either did not know, or did notchoose to speak. He told the young man, among other matters, the reasonof the bitter and lasting enmity that the King felt for the blindnobleman: that Lord Falworth had been one of King Richard\'s council intimes past; that it was not a little owing to him that King Henry, whenEarl of Derby, had been banished from England, and that though hewas then living in the retirement of private life, he bitterly andsteadfastly opposed King Richard\'s abdication. He told Myles that at thetime when Sir John Dale found shelter at Falworth Castle, vengeance wasready to fall upon his father at any moment, and it needed only such apretext as that of sheltering so prominent a conspirator as Sir John tocomplete his ruin.Myles, as he listened intently, could not but confess in his own mindthat the King had many rational, perhaps just, grounds for grievanceagainst such an ardent opponent as the blind Lord had shown himself tobe. ""But, sir,"" said he, after a little space of silence, when PriorEdward had ended, ""to hold enmity and to breed treason are verydifferent matters. Haply my father was Bolingbroke\'s enemy, but, sure,thou dost not believe he is justly and rightfully tainted with treason?""""Nay,"" answered the priest, ""how canst thou ask me such a thing? Did Ibelieve thy father a traitor, thinkest thou I would thus tell his sonthereof? Nay, Myles, I do know thy father well, and have known him formany years, and this of him, that few men are so honorable in heart andsoul as he. But I have told thee all these things to show that the Kingis not without some reason to be thy father\'s unfriend. Neither, haply,is the Earl of Alban without cause of enmity against him. So thou, uponthy part, shouldst not feel bitter rancor against the King for what hathhapped to thy house, nor even against William Brookhurst--I mean theEarl of Alban--for, I tell thee, the worst of our enemies and the worstof men believe themselves always to have right and justice upon theirside, even when they most wish evil to others.""So spoke the gentle old priest, who looked from his peaceful haven withdreamy eyes upon the sweat and tussle of the world\'s battle. Had heinstead been in the thick of the fight, it might have been harder forhim to believe that his enemies ever had right upon their side.""But tell me this,"" said Myles, presently, ""dost thou, then, think thatI do evil in seeking to do a battle of life or death with this wickedEarl of Alban, who hath so ruined my father in body and fortune?""""Nay,"" said Prior Edward, thoughtfully, ""I say not that thou doest evil.War and bloodshed seem hard and cruel matters to me; but God hath giventhat they be in the world, and may He forbid that such a poor worm as Ishould say that they be all wrong and evil. Meseems even an evil thingis sometimes passing good when rightfully used.""Myles did not fully understand what the old man meant, but this much hegathered, that his spiritual father did not think ill of his fightingthe Earl of Alban for his temporal father\'s sake.So Myles went to France in Lord George\'s company, a soldier of fortune,as his Captain was. He was there for only six months, but those sixmonths wrought a great change in his life. In the fierce factionalbattles that raged around the walls of Paris; in the evil life whichhe saw at the Burgundian court in Paris itself after the truce--a courtbrilliant and wicked, witty and cruel--the wonderful liquor of youth hadevaporated rapidly, and his character had crystallized as rapidly intothe hardness of manhood. The warfare, the blood, the evil pleasureswhich he had seen had been a fiery, crucible test to his soul, and Ilove my hero that he should have come forth from it so well. He was nolonger the innocent Sir Galahad who had walked in pure white up theLong Hall to be knighted by the King, but his soul was of that grim,sterling, rugged sort that looked out calmly from his gray eyes upon thewickedness and debauchery around him, and loved it not.Then one day a courier came, bringing a packet. It was a letter from theEarl, bidding Myles return straightway to England and to Mackworth Houseupon the Strand, nigh to London, without delay, and Myles knew that histime had come.It was a bright day in April when he and Gascoyne rode clattering outthrough Temple Bar, leaving behind them quaint old London town, itsblank stone wall, its crooked, dirty streets, its high-gabled woodenhouses, over which rose the sharp spire of St. Paul\'s, towering highinto the golden air. Before them stretched the straight, broad highwayof the Strand, on one side the great houses and palaces of princelypriests and powerful nobles; on the other the Covent Garden, (or theConvent Garden, as it was then called), and the rolling country, wheregreat stone windmills swung their slow-moving arms in the damp, softApril breeze, and away in the distance the Scottish Palace, the WhiteHall, and Westminster.It was the first time that Myles had seen famous London town. In thatdim and distant time of his boyhood, six months before, he wouldhave been wild with delight and enthusiasm. Now he jogged along withGascoyne, gazing about him with calm interest at open shops and boothsand tall, gabled houses; at the busy throng of merchants and craftsmen,jostling and elbowing one another; at townsfolk--men and dames--pickingtheir way along the muddy kennel of a sidewalk. He had seen so much ofthe world that he had lost somewhat of interest in new things. So hedid not care to tarry, but rode, with a mind heavy with graver matters,through the streets and out through the Temple Bar direct for MackworthHouse, near the Savoy Palace.It was with a great deal of interest that Myles and his patron regardedone another when they met for the first time after that half-year whichthe young soldier had spent in France. To Myles it seemed somehow verystrange that his Lordship\'s familiar face and figure should look soexactly the same. To Lord Mackworth, perhaps, it seemed even morestrange that six short months should have wrought so great a change inthe young man. The rugged exposure in camp and field during the hardwinter that had passed had roughened the smooth bloom of his boyishcomplexion and bronzed his fair skin almost as much as a midsummer\'s suncould have done. His beard and mustache had grown again, (now heavierand more mannish from having been shaved), and the white seam of a scarover the right temple gave, if not a stern, at least a determined lookto the strong, square-jawed young face. So the two stood for a whileregarding one another. Myles was the first to break the silence.""My Lord,"" said he, ""thou didst send for me to come back to England;behold, here am I.""""When didst thou land, Sir Myles?"" said the Earl.""I and my squire landed at Dover upon Tuesday last,"" answered the youngman.The Earl of Mackworth stroked his beard softly. ""Thou art marvellouschanged,"" said he. ""I would not have thought it possible.""Myles smiled somewhat grimly. ""I have seen such things, my Lord, inFrance and in Paris,"" said he, quietly, ""as, mayhap, may make a lad aman before his time.""""From which I gather,"" said the Earl, ""that many adventures havebefallen thee. Methought thou wouldst find troublesome times in theDauphin\'s camp, else I would not have sent thee to France.""A little space of silence followed, during which the Earl sat musingly,half absently, regarding the tall, erect, powerful young figure standingbefore him, awaiting his pleasure in motionless, patient, almost doggedsilence. The strong, sinewy hands were clasped and rested upon the longheavy sword, around the scabbard of which the belt was loosely wrapped,and the plates of mail caught and reflected in flashing, broken pieces,the bright sunlight from the window behind.""Sir Myles,"" said the Earl, suddenly, breaking the silence at last,""dost thou know why I sent for thee hither?""""Aye,"" said Myles, calmly, ""how can I else? Thou wouldst not have calledme from Paris but for one thing. Methinks thou hast sent for me to fightthe Earl of Alban, and lo! I am here.""""Thou speakest very boldly,"" said the Earl. ""I do hope that thy deeds beas bold as thy words.""""That,"" said Myles, ""thou must ask other men. Methinks no one may justlycall me coward.""""By my troth!"" said the Earl, smiling, ""looking upon thee--limbs andgirth, bone and sinew--I would not like to be the he that would dareaccuse thee of such a thing. As for thy surmise, I may tell thee plainthat thou art right, and that it was to fight the Earl of Alban I sentfor thee hither. The time is now nearly ripe, and I will straightwaysend for thy father to come to London. Meantime it would not be safeeither for thee or for me to keep thee in my service. I have spoken tohis Highness the Prince of Wales, who, with other of the Princes, isupon our side in this quarrel. He hath promised to take thee into hisservice until the fitting time comes to bring thee and thine enemytogether, and to-morrow I shall take thee to Scotland Yard, where hisHighness is now lodging.""As the Earl ended his speech, Myles bowed, but did not speak. The Earlwaited for a little while, as though to give him the opportunity toanswer.""Well, sirrah,"" said he at last, with a shade of impatience, ""hast thounaught to say? Meseems thou takest all this with marvellous coolness.""""Have I then my Lord\'s permission to speak my mind?""""Aye,"" said the Earl, ""say thy say.""""Sir,"" said Myles, ""I have thought and pondered this matter much whileabroad, and would now ask thee a plain question in all honest an I ha\'thy leave.""The Earl nodded his head.""Sir, am I not right in believing that thou hast certain weightypurposes and aims of thine own to gain an I win this battle against theEarl of Alban?""""Has my brother George been telling thee aught to such a purpose?"" saidthe Earl, after a moment or two of silence.Myles did not answer.""No matter,"" added Lord Mackworth. ""I will not ask thee who told theesuch a thing. As for thy question--well, sin thou ask it frankly, I willbe frank with thee. Yea, I have certain ends to gain in having the Earlof Alban overthrown.""Myles bowed. ""Sir,"" said he, ""haply thine ends are as much beyond aughtthat I can comprehend as though I were a little child; only this I know,that they must be very great. Thou knowest well that in any case I wouldfight me this battle for my father\'s sake and for the honor of my house;nevertheless, in return for all that it will so greatly advantage thee,wilt thou not grant me a boon in return should I overcome mine enemy?""""What is thy boon, Sir Myles?""""That thou wilt grant me thy favor to seek the Lady Alice de Mowbray formy wife.""The Earl of Mackworth started up from his seat. ""Sir Myles Falworth""--hebegan, violently, and then stopped short, drawing his bushy eyebrowstogether into a frown stern, if not sinister.Myles withstood his look calmly and impassively, and presently the Earlturned on his heel, and strode to the open window. A long time passed insilence while he stood there, gazing out of the window into the gardenbeyond with his back to the young man.Suddenly he swung around again. ""Sir Myles,"" said he, ""the family ofFalworth is as good as any in Derbyshire. Just now it is poor and fallenin estate, but if it is again placed in credit and honor, thou, who artthe son of the house, shalt have thy suit weighed with as much respectand consideration as though thou wert my peer in all things, Such is myanswer. Art thou satisfied?""""I could ask no more,"" answered Myles.']"
82,30,Chapter 30,"['29That night Myles lodged at Mackworth House. The next morning, as soonas he had broken his fast, which he did in the privacy of his ownapartments, the Earl bade him and Gascoyne to make ready for the barge,which was then waiting at the river stairs to take them to ScotlandYard.The Earl himself accompanied them, and as the heavy snub-nosed boat,rowed by the six oarsmen in Mackworth livery, slid slowly and heavilyup against the stream, the Earl, leaning back in his cushioned seat,pointed out the various inns of the great priests or nobles; palatialtown residences standing mostly a little distance back from the waterbehind terraced high-walled gardens and lawns. Yon was the Bishop ofExeter\'s Close; yon was the Bishop of Bath\'s; that was York House; andthat Chester Inn. So passing by gardens and lawns and palaces, they cameat last to Scotland Yard stairs, a broad flight of marble steps that ledupward to a stone platform above, upon which opened the gate-way of thegarden beyond.The Scotland Yard of Myles Falworth\'s day was one of the morepretentious and commodious of the palaces of the Strand. It took itsname from having been from ancient times the London inn which thetributary Kings of Scotland occupied when on their periodical visits ofhomage to England. Now, during this time of Scotland\'s independence, thePrince of Wales had taken up his lodging in the old palace, and made itnoisy with the mad, boisterous mirth of his court.As the watermen drew the barge close to the landing-place of the stairs,the Earl stepped ashore, and followed by Myles and Gascoyne, ascendedto the broad gate-way of the river wall of the garden. Three men-at-armswho lounged upon a bench under the shade of the little pent roof of aguard-house beside the wall, arose and saluted as the well-known figureof the Earl mounted the steps. The Earl nodded a cool answer, andpassing unchallenged through the gate, led the way up a pleached walk,beyond which, as Myles could see, there stretched a little grassy lawnand a stone-paved terrace. As the Earl and the two young men approachedthe end of the walk, they were met by the sound of voices and laughter,the clinking of glasses and the rattle of dishes. Turning a corner,they came suddenly upon a party of young gentlemen, who sat at a latebreakfast under the shade of a wide-spreading lime-tree. They hadevidently just left the tilt-yard, for two of the guests--sturdy,thick-set young knights--yet wore a part of their tilting armor.Behind the merry scene stood the gray, hoary old palace, a steep flightof stone steps, and a long, open, stone-arched gallery, which evidentlyled to the kitchen beyond, for along it hurried serving-men, running upand down the tall flight of steps, and bearing trays and dishes and cupsand flagons. It was a merry sight and a pleasant one. The day was warmand balmy, and the yellow sunlight fell in waving uncertain patches oflight, dappling the table-cloth, and twinkling and sparkling upon thedishes, cups, and flagons.At the head of the table sat a young man some three or four yearsolder than Myles, dressed in a full suit of rich blue brocaded velvet,embroidered with gold-thread and trimmed with black fur. His face, whichwas turned towards them as they mounted from the lawn to the littlestone-flagged terrace, was frank and open; the cheeks smooth and fair;the eyes dark and blue. He was tall and rather slight, and wore histhick yellow hair hanging to his shoulders, where it was cut squareacross, after the manner of the times. Myles did not need to be toldthat it was the Prince of Wales.""Ho, Gaffer Fox!"" he cried, as soon as he caught sight of the Earl ofMackworth, ""what wind blows thee hither among us wild mallard drakes?I warrant it is not for love of us, but only to fill thine own larderafter the manner of Sir Fox among the drakes. Whom hast thou with thee?Some gosling thou art about to pluck?""A sudden hush fell upon the company, and all faces were turned towardsthe visitors.The Earl bowed with a soft smile. ""Your Highness,"" said he, smoothly,""is pleased to be pleasant. Sir, I bring you the young knight of whom Ispoke to you some time since--Sir Myles Falworth. You may be pleased tobring to mind that you so condescended as to promise to take him intoyour train until the fitting time arrived for that certain matter ofwhich we spoke.""""Sir Myles,"" said the Prince of Wales, with a frank, pleasant smile, ""Ihave heard great reports of thy skill and prowess in France, both fromMackworth and from others. It will pleasure me greatly to have thee inmy household; more especially,"" he added, ""as it will get thee, callowas thou art, out of my Lord Fox\'s clutches. Our faction cannot dowithout the Earl of Mackworth\'s cunning wits, Sir Myles; ne\'theless Iwould not like to put all my fate and fortune into his hands withoutbond. I hope that thou dost not rest thy fortunes entirely upon his aidand countenance.""All who were present felt the discomfort of the Prince\'s speech, It wasevident that one of his mad, wild humors was upon him. In another casethe hare-brained young courtiers around might have taken their cuefrom him, but the Earl of Mackworth was no subject for their gibesand witticisms. A constrained silence fell, in which the Earl alonemaintained a perfect ease of manner.Myles bowed to hide his own embarrassment. ""Your Highness,"" said he,evasively, ""I rest my fortune, first of all, upon God, His strength andjustice.""""Thou wilt find safer dependence there than upon the Lord of Mackworth,""said the Prince, dryly. ""But come,"" he added, with a sudden change ofvoice and manner, ""these be jests that border too closely upon bitterearnest for a merry breakfast. It is ill to idle with edged tools. Wiltthou not stay and break thy fast with us, my Lord?""""Pardon me, your Highness,"" said the Earl, bowing, and smiling the samesmooth smile his lips had worn from the first--such a smile as Myleshad never thought to have seen upon his haughty face; ""I crave your goodleave to decline. I must return home presently, for even now, haply,your uncle, his Grace of Winchester, is awaiting my coming upon thebusiness you wot of. Haply your Highness will find more joyance in alusty young knight like Sir Myles than in an old fox like myself. So Ileave him with you, in your good care.""Such was Myles\'s introduction to the wild young madcap Prince of Wales,afterwards the famous Henry V, the conqueror of France.For a month or more thereafter he was a member of the princelyhousehold, and, after a little while, a trusted and honored member.Perhaps it was the calm sturdy strength, the courage of the youngknight, that first appealed to the Prince\'s royal heart; perhapsafterwards it was the more sterling qualities that underlaid thatcourage that drew him to the young man; certain it was that in two weeksMyles was the acknowledged favorite. He made no protestation of virtue;he always accompanied the Prince in those madcap ventures to London,where he beheld all manner of wild revelry; he never held himself alooffrom his gay comrades, but he looked upon all their mad sports with thesame calm gaze that had carried him without taint through the courts ofBurgundy and the Dauphin. The gay, roistering young lords and gentlemendubbed him Saint Myles, and jested with him about hair-cloth shirtsand flagellations, but witticism and jest alike failed to move Myles\'spatient virtue; he went his own gait in the habits of his life, and inso going knew as little as the others of the mad court that the Prince\'sgrowing liking for him was, perhaps, more than all else, on account ofthat very temperance.Then, by-and-by, the Prince began to confide in him as he did in none ofthe others. There was no great love betwixt the King and his son; it hashappened very often that the Kings of England have felt bitter jealousytowards the heirs-apparent as they have grown in power, and such was thecase with the great King Henry IV. The Prince often spoke to Myles ofthe clashing and jarring between himself and his father, and the thoughtbegan to come to Myles\'s mind by degrees that maybe the King\'s jealousyaccounted not a little for the Prince\'s reckless intemperance.Once, for instance, as the Prince leaned upon, his shoulder waiting,whilst the attendants made ready the barge that was to carry them downthe river to the city, he said, abruptly: ""Myles, what thinkest thou ofus all? Doth not thy honesty hold us in contempt?""""Nay, Highness,"" said Myles. ""How could I hold contempt?""""Marry,"" said the Prince, ""I myself hold contempt, and am not as honesta man as thou. But, prithee, have patience with me, Myles. Some day,perhaps, I too will live a clean life. Now, an I live seriously, theKing will be more jealous of me than ever, and that is not a little.Maybe I live thus so that he may not know what I really am in soothlyearnest.""The Prince also often talked to Myles concerning his own affairs; ofthe battle he was to fight for his father\'s honor, of how the Earl ofMackworth had plotted and planned to bring him face to face with theEarl of Alban. He spoke to Myles more than once of the many greatchanges of state and party that hung upon the downfall of the enemyof the house of Falworth, and showed him how no hand but his own couldstrike that enemy down; if he fell, it must be through the son ofFalworth. Sometimes it seemed to Myles as though he and his blind fatherwere the centre of a great web of plot and intrigue, stretching far andwide, that included not only the greatest houses of England, but royaltyand the political balance of the country as well, and even before thegreatness of it all he did not flinch.Then, at last, came the beginning of the time for action. It was in theearly part of May, and Myles had been a member of the Prince\'s householdfor a little over a month. One morning he was ordered to attend thePrince in his privy cabinet, and, obeying the summons, he found thePrince, his younger brother, the Duke of Bedford, and his uncle, theBishop of Winchester, seated at a table, where they had just beenrefreshing themselves with a flagon of wine and a plate of wafers.""My poor Myles,"" said the Prince, smiling, as the young knight bowed tothe three, and then stood erect, as though on duty. ""It shames my heart,brother--and thou, uncle--it shames my heart to be one privy to thisthing which we are set upon to do. Here be we, the greatest Lords ofEngland, making a cat\'s-paw of this lad--for he is only yet a boy--andof his blind father, for to achieve our ends against Alban\'s faction. Itseemeth not over-honorable to my mind.""""Pardon me, your Highness,"" said Myles, blushing to the roots of hishair; ""but, an I may be so bold as to speak, I reck nothing of what youraims may be; I only look to restoring my father\'s honor and the honor ofour house.""""Truly,"" said the Prince, smiling, ""that is the only matter that makethme willing to lay my hands to this business. Dost thou know why I havesent for thee? It is because this day thou must challenge the Duke ofAlban before the King. The Earl of Mackworth has laid all his plans andthe time is now ripe. Knowest that thy father is at Mackworth House?""""Nay,"" said Myles; ""I knew it not.""""He hath been there for nearly two days,"" said the Prince. ""Just now theEarl hath sent for us to come first to Mackworth House. Then to goto the palace, for he hath gained audience with the King, and hath soarranged it that the Earl of Alban is to be there as well. We all gostraightway; so get thyself ready as soon as may be.""Perhaps Myles\'s heart began beating more quickly within him at thenearness of that great happening which he had looked forward to for solong. If it did, he made no sign of his emotion, but only asked, ""Howmust I clothe myself, your Highness?""""Wear thy light armor,"" said the Prince, ""but no helmet, a jupponbearing the arms and colors that the Earl gave thee when thou wertknighted, and carry thy right-hand gauntlet under thy belt for thychallenge. Now make haste, for time passes.""']"
82,31,Chapter 31,"['30Adjoining the ancient palace of Westminster, where King Henry IV wasthen holding his court, was a no less ancient stone building known asthe Painted Room. Upon the walls were depicted a series of battle scenesin long bands reaching around this room, one above another. Some ofthese pictures had been painted as far back as the days of Henry III,others had been added since his time. They chronicled the various warsof the King of England, and it was from them that the little hall tookits name of the Painted Room.This ancient wing, or offshoot, of the main buildings was more retiredfrom the hurly-burly of outer life than other parts of the palace, andthither the sick King was very fond of retiring from the business ofState, which ever rested more and more heavily upon his shoulders,sometimes to squander in quietness a spare hour or two; sometimes toidle over a favorite book; sometimes to play a game of chess with afavorite courtier. The cold painted walls had been hung with tapestry,and its floor had been spread with arras carpet. These and the cushionedcouches and chairs that stood around gave its gloomy antiquity an air ofcomfort--an air even of luxury.It was to this favorite retreat of the King\'s that Myles was broughtthat morning with his father to face the great Earl of Alban.In the anteroom the little party of Princes and nobles who escortedthe father and son had held a brief consultation. Then the others hadentered, leaving Myles and his blind father in charge of Lord Lumley andtwo knights of the court, Sir Reginald Hallowell and Sir Piers Averell.Myles, as he stood patiently waiting, with his father\'s arm resting inhis, could hear the muffled sound of voices from beyond the arras. Amongothers, he recognized the well-remembered tones of the King. He fanciedthat he heard his own name mentioned more than once, and then the soundof talking ceased. The next moment the arras was drawn aside, and theEarl entered the antechamber again.""All is ready, cousin,"" said he to Lord Falworth, in a suppressed voice.""Essex hath done as he promised, and Alban is within there now."" Then,turning to Myles, speaking in the same low voice, and betraying moreagitation than Myles had thought it possible for him to show, ""SirMyles,"" said he, ""remember all that hath been told thee. Thou knowestwhat thou hast to say and do."" Then, without further word, he took LordFalworth by the hand, and led the way into the room, Myles followingclose behind.The King half sat, half inclined, upon a cushioned seat close to whichstood the two Princes. There were some dozen others present, mostlypriests and noblemen of high quality who clustered in a group at alittle distance. Myles knew most of them at a glance having seen themcome and go at Scotland Yard. But among them all, he singled out onlyone--the Earl of Alban. He had not seen that face since he was a littlechild eight years old, but now that he beheld it again, it fittedinstantly and vividly into the remembrance of the time of that terriblescene at Falworth Castle, when he had beheld the then Lord Brookhurststanding above the dead body of Sir John Dale, with the bloody maceclinched in his hand. There were the same heavy black brows, sinisterand gloomy, the same hooked nose, the same swarthy cheeks. He evenremembered the deep dent in the forehead, where the brows met inperpetual frown. So it was that upon that face his looks centred andrested.The Earl of Alban had just been speaking to some Lord who stood besidehim, and a half-smile still hung about the corners of his lips. Atfirst, as he looked up at the entrance of the newcomers, there was noother expression; then suddenly came a flash of recognition, a look ofwide-eyed amazement; then the blood left the cheeks and the lips, andthe face grew very pale. No doubt he saw at a flash that some greatdanger overhung him in this sudden coming of his old enemy, for he wasas keen and as astute a politician as he was a famous warrior. At leasthe knew that the eyes of most of those present were fixed keenly andsearchingly upon him. After the first start of recognition, his lefthand, hanging at his side, gradually closed around the scabbard of hissword, clutching it in a vice-like grip.Meantime the Earl of Mackworth had led the blind Lord to the King, whereboth kneeled.""Why, how now, my Lord?"" said the King. ""Methought it was our youngPaladin whom we knighted at Devlen that was to be presented, and herethou bringest this old man. A blind man, ha! What is the meaning ofthis?""""Majesty,"" said the Earl, ""I have taken this chance to bring to thymerciful consideration one who hath most wofully and unjustly sufferedfrom thine anger. Yonder stands the young knight of whom we spake; thisis his father, Gilbert Reginald, whilom Lord Falworth, who craves mercyand justice at thy hands.""""Falworth,"" said the King, placing his hand to his head. ""The name isnot strange to mine ears, but I cannot place it. My head hath troubledme sorely to-day, and I cannot remember.""At this point the Earl of Alban came quietly and deliberately forward.""Sire,"" said he, ""pardon my boldness in so venturing to address you, buthaply I may bring the name more clearly to your mind. He is, as my Lordof Mackworth said, the whilom Baron Falworth, the outlawed, attaintedtraitor; so declared for the harboring of Sir John Dale, who was one ofthose who sought your Majesty\'s life at Windsor eleven years ago.Sire, he is mine enemy as well, and is brought hither by my proclaimedenemies. Should aught occur to my harm, I rest my case in your gracioushands.""The dusty red flamed into the King\'s pale, sickly face in answer, and herose hastily from his seat.""Aye,"" said he, ""I remember me now--I remember me the man and the name!Who hath dared bring him here before us?"" All the dull heaviness ofsickness was gone for the moment, and King Henry was the King Henry often years ago as he rolled his eyes balefully from one to another of thecourtiers who stood silently around.The Earl of Mackworth shot a covert glance at the Bishop of Winchester,who came forward in answer.""Your Majesty,"" said he, ""here am I, your brother, who beseech you asyour brother not to judge over-hastily in this matter. It is truethat this man has been adjudged a traitor, but he has been so adjudgedwithout a hearing. I beseech thee to listen patiently to whatsoever hemay have to say.""The King fixed the Bishop with a look of the bitterest, deepest anger,holding his nether lip tightly under his teeth--a trick he had whenstrongly moved with anger--and the Bishop\'s eyes fell under the look.Meantime the Earl of Alban stood calm and silent. No doubt he saw thatthe King\'s anger was likely to befriend him more than any words that hehimself could say, and he perilled his case with no more speech whichcould only prove superfluous.At last the King turned a face red and swollen with anger to the blindLord, who still kneeled before him.""What hast thou to say?"" he said, in a deep and sullen voice.""Gracious and merciful Lord,"" said the blind nobleman, ""I come to thee,the fountain-head of justice, craving justice. Sire, I do now and heredeny my treason, which denial I could not before make, being blind andhelpless, and mine enemies strong and malignant. But now, sire, Heavenhath sent me help, and therefore I do acclaim before thee that myaccuser, William Bushy Brookhurst, Earl of Alban, is a foul and anattainted liar in all that he hath accused me of. To uphold whichallegation, and to defend me, who am blinded by his unknightliness, I dooffer a champion to prove all that I say with his body in combat.""The Earl of Mackworth darted a quick look at Myles, who came forward themoment his father had ended, and kneeled beside him. The King offered nointerruption to his speech, but he bent a look heavy with anger upon theyoung man.""My gracious Lord and King,"" said Myles, ""I, the son of the accused, dooffer myself as his champion in this cause, beseeching thee of thy graceleave to prove the truth of the same, being a belted knight by thy graceand of thy creation and the peer of any who weareth spurs."" Thereupon,rising, he drew his iron gauntlet from his girdle, and flung it clashingdown upon the floor, and with his heart swelling within him with angerand indignation and pity of his blind father, he cried, in a loudvoice, ""I do accuse thee, William of Alban, that thou liest vilely asaforesaid, and here cast down my gage, daring thee to take it up.""The Earl of Alban made as though he would accept the challenge, but theKing stopped him hastily.""Stop!"" he cried, harshly. ""Touch not the gage! Let it lie--let it lie,I tell thee, my Lord! Now then,"" said he, turning to the others, ""tellme what meaneth all this coil? Who brought this man hither?""He looked from one to another of those who stood silently around, but noone answered.""I see,"" said he, ""ye all have had to do with it. It is as my Lord ofAlban sayeth; ye are his enemies, and ye are my enemies as well. In thisI do smell a vile plot. I cannot undo what I have done, and since I havemade this young man a knight with mine own hands, I cannot deny thathe is fit to challenge my Lord of Alban. Ne\'theless, the High Court ofChivalry shall adjudge this case. Meantime,"" said he, turning to theEarl Marshal, who was present, ""I give thee this attainted Lord incharge. Convey him presently to the Tower, and let him abide ourpleasure there. Also, thou mayst take up yon gage, and keep it till itis redeemed according to our pleasure.""He stood thoughtfully for a moment, and then raising his eyes, lookedfixedly at the Earl of Mackworth. ""I know,"" he said, ""that I be a rightsick man, and there be some who are already plotting to overthrow thosewho have held up my hand with their own strength for all these years.""Then speaking more directly: ""My Lord Earl of Mackworth, I see your handin this before all others. It was thou who so played upon me as to getme to knight this young man, and thus make him worthy to challenge myLord of Alban. It was thy doings that brought him here to-day, backedby mine own sons and my brother and by these noblemen."" Then turningsuddenly to the Earl of Alban: ""Come, my Lord,"" said he; ""I am awearywith all this coil. Lend me thine arm to leave this place."" So itwas that he left the room, leaning upon the Earl of Alban\'s arm, andfollowed by the two or three of the Alban faction who were present.""Your Royal Highness,"" said the Earl Marshal, ""I must e\'en do the King\'sbidding, and take this gentleman into arrest.""""Do thy duty,"" said the Prince. ""We knew it must come to this. Meanwhilehe is to be a prisoner of honor, and see that he be well lodged andcared for. Thou wilt find my barge at the stairs to convey him down theriver, and I myself will come this afternoon to visit him.""']"
82,32,Chapter 32,"['31It was not until the end of July that the High Court of Chivalryrendered its judgment. There were many unusual points in the case, someof which bore heavily against Lord Falworth, some of which were inhis favor. He was very ably defended by the lawyers whom the Earlof Mackworth had engaged upon his side; nevertheless, under ordinarycircumstances, the judgment, no doubt, would have been quickly renderedagainst him. As it was, however, the circumstances were not ordinary,and it was rendered in his favor. The Court besought the King to grantthe ordeal by battle, to accept Lord Falworth\'s champion, and to appointthe time and place for the meeting.The decision must have been a most bitter, galling one for the sickKing. He was naturally of a generous, forgiving nature, but LordFalworth in his time of power had been an unrelenting and fearlessopponent, and his Majesty who, like most generous men, could onoccasions be very cruel and intolerant, had never forgiven him. He hadsteadily thrown the might of his influence with the Court against theFalworths\' case, but that influence was no longer all-powerful for goodor ill. He was failing in health, and it could only be a matter of a fewyears, probably of only a few months, before his successor sat upon thethrone.Upon the other hand, the Prince of Wales\'s faction had been steadily,and of late rapidly, increasing in power, and in the Earl of Mackworth,its virtual head, it possessed one of the most capable politicians andastute intriguers in Europe. So, as the outcome of all the plotting andcounter-plotting, scheming and counter-scheming, the case was decided inLord Falworth\'s favor. The knowledge of the ultimate result was knownto the Prince of Wales\'s circle almost a week before it was finallydecided. Indeed, the Earl of Mackworth had made pretty sure of thatresult before he had summoned Myles from France, but upon the King itfell like the shock of a sudden blow. All that day he kept himself inmoody seclusion, nursing his silent, bitter anger, and making onlyone outbreak, in which he swore by the Holy Rood that should Myles beworsted in the encounter, he would not take the battle into his ownhands, but would suffer him to be slain, and furthermore, that shouldthe Earl show signs of failing at any time, he would do all in his powerto save him. One of the courtiers who had been present, and who wassecretly inclined to the Prince of Wales\'s faction, had repeated thisspeech at Scotland Yard, and the Prince had said, ""That meaneth, Myles,that thou must either win or die.""""And so I would have it to be, my Lord,"" Myles had answered.It was not until nearly a fortnight after the decision of the Court ofChivalry had been rendered that the King announced the time and placeof battle--the time to be the 3d of September, the place to beSmithfield--a spot much used for such encounters.During the three weeks or so that intervened between this announcementand the time of combat, Myles went nearly every day to visit the listsin course of erection. Often the Prince went with him; always two orthree of his friends of the Scotland Yard court accompanied him.The lists were laid out in the usual form. The true or principal list inwhich the combatants were to engage was sixty yards long and forty yardswide; this rectangular space being surrounded by a fence about six feethigh, painted vermilion. Between the fence and the stand where the Kingand the spectators sat, and surrounding the central space, was theouter or false list, also surrounded by a fence. In the false list theConstable and the Marshal and their followers and attendants were to bestationed at the time of battle to preserve the general peace during thecontest between the principals.One day as Myles, his princely patron, and his friends entered thebarriers, leaving their horses at the outer gate, they met the Earl ofAlban and his followers, who were just quitting the lists, which theyalso were in the habit of visiting nearly every day. As the two partiespassed one another, the Earl spoke to a gentleman walking beside him andin a voice loud enough to be clearly overheard by the others: ""Yonderis the young sprig of Falworth,"" said he. ""His father, my Lords, isnot content with forfeiting his own life for his treason, but must,forsooth, throw away his son\'s also. I have faced and overthrown many abetter knight than that boy.""Myles heard the speech, and knew that it was intended for him to hearit; but he paid no attention to it, walking composedly at the Prince\'sside. The Prince had also overheard it, and after a little space ofsilence asked, ""Dost thou not feel anxiety for thy coming battle,Myles?""""Yea, my Lord,"" said Myles; ""sometimes I do feel anxiety, but not suchas my Lord of Alban would have me feel in uttering the speech that hespake anon. It is anxiety for my father\'s sake and my mother\'s sake thatI feel, for truly there are great matters for them pending upon thisfight. Ne\'theless, I do know that God will not desert me in my cause,for verily my father is no traitor.""""But the Earl of Alban,"" said the Prince, gravely, ""is reputed one ofthe best-skilled knights in all England; moreover, he is merciless andwithout generosity, so that an he gain aught advantage over thee, hewill surely slay thee.""""I am not afraid, my Lord,"" said Myles, still calmly and composedly.""Nor am I afraid for thee, Myles,"" said the Prince, heartily, puttinghis arm, as he spoke, around the young man\'s shoulder; ""for truly, wertthou a knight of forty years, instead of one of twenty, thou couldst notbear thyself with more courage.""As the time for the duel approached, the days seemed to drag themselvesalong upon leaden feet; nevertheless, the days came and went, as alldays do, bringing with them, at last, the fateful 3d of September.Early in the morning, while the sun was still level and red, the Princehimself, unattended, came to Myles\'s apartment, in the outer room ofwhich Gascoyne was bustling busily about arranging the armor piece bypiece; renewing straps and thongs, but not whistling over his work as heusually did. The Prince nodded to him, and then passed silently throughto the inner chamber. Myles was upon his knees, and Father Ambrose,the Prince\'s chaplain, was beside him. The Prince stood silently at thedoor, until Myles, having told his last bead, rose and turned towardshim.""My dear Lord,"" said the young knight, ""I give you gramercy for thegreat honor you do me in coming so early for to visit me.""""Nay, Myles, give me no thanks,"" said the Prince, frankly reaching himhis hand, which Myles took and set to his lips. ""I lay bethinking me ofthee this morning, while yet in bed, and so, as I could not sleep anymore, I was moved to come hither to see thee.""Quite a number of the Prince\'s faction were at the breakfast at ScotlandYard that morning; among others, the Earl of Mackworth. All were more orless oppressed with anxiety, for nearly all of them had staked much uponthe coming battle. If Alban conquered, he would be more powerful to harmthem and to revenge himself upon them than ever, and Myles was a veryyoung champion upon whom to depend. Myles himself, perhaps, showed aslittle anxiety as any; he certainly ate more heartily of his breakfastthat morning than many of the others.After the meal was ended, the Prince rose. ""The boat is ready at thestairs,"" said he; ""if thou wouldst go to the Tower to visit thy father,Myles, before hearing mass, I and Cholmondeley and Vere and Poins willgo with thee, if ye, Lords and gentlemen, will grant me your pardonfor leaving you. Are there any others that thou wouldst have accompanythee?""""I would have Sir James Lee and my squire, Master Gascoyne, if thou artso pleased to give them leave to go,"" answered Myles.""So be it,"" said the Prince. ""We will stop at Mackworth stairs for theknight.""The barge landed at the west stairs of the Tower wharf, and the wholeparty were received with more than usual civilities by the Governor, whoconducted them at once to the Tower where Lord Falworth was lodged. LadyFalworth met them at the head of the stairs; her eyes were very red andher face pale, and as Myles raised her hand and set a long kiss upon it,her lips trembled, and she turned her face quickly away, pressingher handkerchief for one moment to her eyes. Poor lady! What agony ofanxiety and dread did she not suffer for her boy\'s sake that day! Myleshad not hidden both from her and his father that he must either win ordie.As Myles turned from his mother, Prior Edward came out from the innerchamber, and was greeted warmly by him. The old priest had arrived inLondon only the day before, having come down from Crosbey Priory to bewith his friend\'s family during this their time of terrible anxiety.After a little while of general talk, the Prince and his attendantsretired, leaving the family together, only Sir James Lee and Gascoyneremaining behind.Many matters that had been discussed before were now finally settled,the chief of which was the disposition of Lady Falworth in case thebattle should go against them. Then Myles took his leave, kissing hismother, who began crying, and comforting her with brave assurances.Prior Edward accompanied him as far as the head of the Tower stairs,where Myles kneeled upon the stone steps, while the good priest blessedhim and signed the cross upon his forehead. The Prince was waiting inthe walled garden adjoining, and as they rowed back again up the riverto Scotland Yard, all were thoughtful and serious, even Poins\' andVere\'s merry tongues being stilled from their usual quips and jesting.It was about the quarter of the hour before eleven o\'clock when Myles,with Gascoyne, set forth for the lists. The Prince of Wales, togetherwith most of his court, had already gone on to Smithfield, leavingbehind him six young knights of his household to act as escort to theyoung champion. Then at last the order to horse was given; the greatgate swung open, and out they rode, clattering and jingling, thesunlight gleaming and flaming and flashing upon their polished armor.They drew rein to the right, and so rode in a little cloud of dust alongthe Strand Street towards London town, with the breeze blowing merrily,and the sunlight shining as sweetly and blithesomely as though they wereriding to a wedding rather than to a grim and dreadful ordeal that meanteither victory or death.']"
82,33,Chapter 33,"['32In the days of King Edward III a code of laws relating to trial bybattle had been compiled for one of his sons, Thomas of Woodstock. Inthis work each and every detail, to the most minute, had been arrangedand fixed, and from that time judicial combats had been regulated inaccordance with its mandates.It was in obedience to this code that Myles Falworth appeared at theeast gate of the lists (the east gate being assigned by law to thechallenger), clad in full armor of proof, attended by Gascoyne, andaccompanied by two of the young knights who had acted as his escort fromScotland Yard.At the barriers he was met by the attorney Willingwood, the chief lawyerwho had conducted the Falworth case before the High Court of Chivalry,and who was to attend him during the administration of the oaths beforethe King.As Myles presented himself at the gate he was met by the Constable, theMarshal, and their immediate attendants. The Constable, laying his handupon the bridle-rein, said, in a loud voice: ""Stand, Sir Knight, andtell me why thou art come thus armed to the gates of the lists. What isthy name? Wherefore art thou come?""Myles answered, ""I am Myles Falworth, a Knight of the Bath by grace ofhis Majesty King Henry IV and by his creation, and do come hither todefend my challenge upon the body of William Bushy Brookhurst, Earl ofAlban, proclaiming him an unknightly knight and a false and perjuredliar, in that he hath accused Gilbert Reginald, Lord Falworth, oftreason against our beloved Lord, his Majesty the King, and may Goddefend the right!""As he ended speaking, the Constable advanced close to his side, andformally raising the umbril of the helmet, looked him in the face.Thereupon, having approved his identity, he ordered the gates to beopened, and bade Myles enter the lists with his squire and his friends.At the south side of the lists a raised scaffolding had been built forthe King and those who looked on. It was not unlike that which hadbeen erected at Devlen Castle when Myles had first jousted as beltedknight--here were the same raised seat for the King, the tapestries, thehangings, the fluttering pennons, and the royal standard floating above;only here were no fair-faced ladies looking down upon him, but instead,stern-browed Lords and knights in armor and squires, and here were nomerry laughing and buzz of talk and flutter of fans and kerchiefs, butall was very quiet and serious.Myles riding upon his horse, with Gascoyne holding the bridle-rein,and his attorney walking beside him with his hand upon the stirrups,followed the Constable across the lists to an open space in front of theseat where the King sat. Then, having reached his appointed station, hestopped, and the Constable, advancing to the foot of the stair-way thatled to the dais above, announced in a loud voice that the challenger hadentered the lists.""Then called the defendant straightway,"" said the King, ""for noondraweth nigh.""The day was very warm, and the sun, bright and unclouded, shone fiercelydown upon the open lists. Perhaps few men nowadays could bear thescorching heat of iron plates such as Myles wore, from which the bodywas only protected by a leathern jacket and hose. But men\'s bodies inthose days were tougher and more seasoned to hardships of weather thanthey are in these our times. Myles thought no more of the burningiron plates that incased him than a modern soldier thinks of his dressuniform in warm weather. Nevertheless, he raised the umbril of hishelmet to cool his face as he waited the coming of his opponent. Heturned his eyes upward to the row of seats on the scaffolding above,and even in the restless, bewildering multitude of strange faces turnedtowards him recognized those that he knew: the Prince of Wales, hiscompanions of the Scotland Yard household, the Duke of Clarence,the Bishop of Winchester, and some of the noblemen of the Earl ofMackworth\'s party, who had been buzzing about the Prince for the pastmonth or so. But his glance swept over all these, rather perceivingthan seeing them, and then rested upon a square box-like compartment notunlike a prisoner\'s dock in the courtroom of our day, for in the box sathis father, with the Earl of Mackworth upon one side and Sir James Leeupon the other. The blind man\'s face was very pale, but still wore itsusual expression of calm serenity--the calm serenity of a blind face.The Earl was also very pale, and he kept his eyes fixed steadfastly uponMyles with a keen and searching look, as though to pierce to the verybottom of the young man\'s heart, and discover if indeed not one littlefragment of dryrot of fear or uncertainty tainted the solid courage ofhis knighthood.Then he heard the criers calling the defendant at the four corners ofthe list: ""Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! William Bushy Brookhurst, Earl of Alban,come to this combat, in which you be enterprised this day to dischargeyour sureties before the King, the Constable, and the Marshal, and toencounter in your defence Myles Falworth, knight, the accepted championupon behalf of Gilbert Reginald Falworth, the challenger! Oyez! Oyez!Oyez! Let the defendant come!""So they continued calling, until, by the sudden turning of all faces,Myles knew that his enemy was at hand.Then presently he saw the Earl and his attendants enter the outer gateat the west end of the barrier; he saw the Constable and Marshal meethim; he saw the formal words of greeting pass; he saw the Constableraise the umbril of the helmet. Then the gate opened, and the Earl ofAlban entered, clad cap-a-pie in a full suit of magnificent Milan armorwithout juppon or adornment of any kind. As he approached across thelists, Myles closed the umbril of his helmet, and then sat quite stilland motionless, for the time was come.So he sat, erect and motionless as a statue of iron, half hearing thereading of the long intricately-worded bills, absorbed in many thoughtsof past and present things. At last the reading ended, and then hecalmly and composedly obeyed, under the direction of his attorney,the several forms and ceremonies that followed; answered the variousofficial questions, took the various oaths. Then Gascoyne, leading thehorse by the bridle-rein, conducted him back to his station at the eastend of the lists.As the faithful friend and squire made one last and searchingexamination of arms and armor, the Marshal and the clerk came to theyoung champion and administered the final oath by which he swore that hecarried no concealed weapons.The weapons allowed by the High Court were then measured and attested.They consisted of the long sword, the short sword, the dagger, the mace,and a weapon known as the hand-gisarm, or glave-lot--a heavy swordlikeblade eight palms long, a palm in breadth, and riveted to a stout handleof wood three feet long.The usual lance had not been included in the list of arms, thehand-gisarm being substituted in its place. It was a fearful andmurderous weapon, though cumbersome, Unhandy, and ill adapted for quickor dexterous stroke; nevertheless, the Earl of Alban had petitionedthe King to have it included in the list, and in answer to the King\'sexpressed desire the Court had adopted it in the stead of the lance,yielding thus much to the royal wishes. Nor was it a small concession.The hand-gisarm had been a weapon very much in vogue in King Richard\'sday, and was now nearly if not entirely out of fashion with the youngergeneration of warriors. The Earl of Alban was, of course, well used tothe blade; with Myles it was strange and new, either for attack or indefence.With the administration of the final oath and the examination of theweapons, the preliminary ceremonies came to an end, and presently Mylesheard the criers calling to clear the lists. As those around him movedto withdraw, the young knight drew off his mailed gauntlet, and gaveGascoyne\'s hand one last final clasp, strong, earnest, and intense withthe close friendship of young manhood, and poor Gascoyne looked up athim with a face ghastly white.Then all were gone; the gates of the principal list and that of thefalse list were closed clashing, and Myles was alone, face to face, withhis mortal enemy.']"
82,34,Chapter 34,"['33There was a little while of restless, rustling silence, during which theConstable took his place in the seat appointed for him directly infront of and below the King\'s throne. A moment or two when even therestlessness and the rustling were quieted, and then the King leanedforward and spoke to the Constable, who immediately called out, in aloud, clear voice.""Let them go!"" Then again, ""Let them go!"" Then, for the third and lasttime, ""Let them go and do their endeavor, in God\'s name!""At this third command the combatants, each of whom had till that momentbeen sitting as motionless as a statue of iron, tightened rein, and rodeslowly and deliberately forward without haste, yet without hesitation,until they met in the very middle of the lists.In the battle which followed, Myles fought with the long sword, the Earlwith the hand-gisarm for which he had asked. The moment they met, thecombat was opened, and for a time nothing was heard but the thunderousclashing and clamor of blows, now and then beating intermittently, nowand then pausing. Occasionally, as the combatants spurred together,checked, wheeled, and recovered, they would be hidden for a moment ina misty veil of dust, which, again drifting down the wind, perhapsrevealed them drawn a little apart, resting their panting horses. Then,again, they would spur together, striking as they passed, wheeling andstriking again.Upon the scaffolding all was still, only now and then for the buzz ofmuffled exclamations or applause of those who looked on. Mostly theapplause was from Myles\'s friends, for from the very first he showed andsteadily maintained his advantage over the older man. ""Hah! well struck!well recovered!"" ""Look ye! the sword bit that time!"" ""Nay, look, saw yehim pass the point of the gisarm?"" Then, ""Falworth! Falworth!"" as somemore than usually skilful stroke or parry occurred.Meantime Myles\'s father sat straining his sightless eyeballs, as thoughto pierce his body\'s darkness with one ray of light that would show himhow his boy held his own in the fight, and Lord Mackworth, leaning withhis lips close to the blind man\'s ear, told him point by point how thebattle stood.""Fear not, Gilbert,"" said he at each pause in the fight. ""He holdeth hisown right well."" Then, after a while: ""God is with us, Gilbert. Albanis twice wounded and his horse faileth. One little while longer and thevictory is ours!""A longer and more continuous interval of combat followed thislast assurance, during which Myles drove the assault fiercely andunrelentingly as though to overbear his enemy by the very powerand violence of the blows he delivered. The Earl defended himselfdesperately, but was borne back, back, back, farther and farther. Everynerve of those who looked on was stretched to breathless tensity, when,almost as his enemy was against the barriers, Myles paused and rested.""Out upon it!"" exclaimed the Earl of Mackworth, almost shrilly in hisexcitement, as the sudden lull followed the crashing of blows. ""Why doththe boy spare him? That is thrice he hath given him grace to recover;an he had pushed the battle that time he had driven him back against thebarriers.""It was as the Earl had said; Myles had three times given his enemy gracewhen victory was almost in his very grasp. He had three times sparedhim, in spite of all he and those dear to him must suffer should hiscruel and merciless enemy gain the victory. It was a false and foolishgenerosity, partly the fault of his impulsive youth--more largely ofhis romantic training in the artificial code of French chivalry. He feltthat the battle was his, and so he gave his enemy these three chances torecover, as some chevalier or knight-errant of romance might havedone, instead of pushing the combat to a mercifully speedy end--and hisfoolish generosity cost him dear.In the momentary pause that had thus stirred the Earl of Mackworth toa sudden outbreak, the Earl of Alban sat upon his panting, sweatingwar-horse, facing his powerful young enemy at about twelve pacesdistant. He sat as still as a rock, holding his gisarm poised in frontof him. He had, as the Earl of Mackworth had said, been wounded twice,and each time with the point of the sword, so much more dangerous than adirect cut with the weapon. One wound was beneath his armor, and no onebut he knew how serious it might be; the other was under the overlappingof the epauhere, and from it a finger\'s-breadth of blood ran straightdown his side and over the housings of his horse. From without, thestill motionless iron figure appeared calm and expressionless; within,who knows what consuming blasts of hate, rage, and despair swept hisheart as with a fiery whirlwind.As Myles looked at the motionless, bleeding figure, his breast swelledwith pity. ""My Lord,"" said he, ""thou art sore wounded and the fight isagainst thee; wilt thou not yield thee?""No one but that other heard the speech, and no one but Myles heard theanswer that came back, hollow, cavernous, ""Never, thou dog! Never!""Then in an instant, as quick as a flash, his enemy spurred straight uponMyles, and as he spurred he struck a last desperate, swinging blow, inwhich he threw in one final effort all the strength of hate, of fury,and of despair. Myles whirled his horse backward, warding the blow withhis shield as he did so. The blade glanced from the smooth face of theshield, and, whether by mistake or not, fell straight and true, and withalmost undiminished force, upon the neck of Myles\'s war-horse, and justbehind the ears. The animal staggered forward, and then fell upon itsknees, and at the same instant the other, as though by the impetus ofthe rush, dashed full upon it with all the momentum lent by the weightof iron it carried. The shock was irresistible, and the stunned andwounded horse was flung upon the ground, rolling over and over. As hishorse fell, Myles wrenched one of his feet out of the stirrup; the othercaught for an instant, and he was flung headlong with stunning violence,his armor crashing as he fell. In the cloud of dust that arose noone could see just what happened, but that what was done was donedeliberately no one doubted. The earl, at once checking and spurringhis foaming charger, drove the iron-shod war-horse directly over Myles\'sprostrate body. Then, checking him fiercely with the curb, reined himback, the hoofs clashing and crashing, over the figure beneath. Sohe had ridden over the father at York, and so he rode over the son atSmithfield.Myles, as he lay prostrate and half stunned by his fall, had seen hisenemy thus driving his rearing horse down upon him, but was not able todefend himself. A fallen knight in full armor was utterly powerless torise without assistance; Myles lay helpless in the clutch of the veryiron that was his defence. He closed his eyes involuntarily, and thenhorse and rider were upon him. There was a deafening, sparkling crash,a glimmering faintness, then another crash as the horse was reinedfuriously back again, and then a humming stillness.In a moment, upon the scaffolding all was a tumult of uproar andconfusion, shouting and gesticulation; only the King sat calm, sullen,impassive. The Earl wheeled his horse and sat for a moment or two asthough to make quite sure that he knew the King\'s mind. The blow thathad been given was foul, unknightly, but the King gave no sign either ofacquiescence or rebuke; he had willed that Myles was to die.Then the Earl turned again, and rode deliberately up to his prostrateenemy.When Myles opened his eyes after that moment of stunning silence, it wasto see the other looming above him on his war-horse, swinging his gisarmfor one last mortal blow--pitiless, merciless.The sight of that looming peril brought back Myles\'s wandering senseslike a flash of lightning. He flung up his shield, and met the blow evenas it descended, turning it aside. It only protracted the end.Once more the Earl of Alban raised the gisarm, swinging it twice aroundhis head before he struck. This time, though the shield glanced it, theblow fell upon the shoulder-piece, biting through the steel plate andleathern jack beneath even to the bone. Then Myles covered his head withhis shield as a last protecting chance for life.For the third time the Earl swung the blade flashing, and then it fell,straight and true, upon the defenceless body, just below the left arm,biting deep through the armor plates. For an instant the blade stuckfast, and that instant was Myles\'s salvation. Under the agony of theblow he gave a muffled cry, and almost instinctively grasped the shaftof the weapon with both hands. Had the Earl let go his end of theweapon, he would have won the battle at his leisure and most easily; asit was, he struggled violently to wrench the gisarm away from Myles. Inthat short, fierce struggle Myles was dragged to his knees, and then,still holding the weapon with one hand, he clutched the trappings of theEarl\'s horse with the other. The next moment he was upon his feet. Theother struggled to thrust him away, but Myles, letting go the gisarm,which he held with his left hand, clutched him tightly by the sword-beltin the intense, vise-like grip of despair. In vain the Earl strove tobeat him loose with the shaft of the gisarm, in vain he spurred andreared his horse to shake him off; Myles held him tight, in spite of allhis struggles.He felt neither the streaming blood nor the throbbing agony of hiswounds; every faculty of soul, mind, body, every power of life, wascentered in one intense, burning effort. He neither felt, thought, norreasoned, but clutching, with the blindness of instinct, the heavy,spiked, iron-headed mace that hung at the Earl\'s saddle-bow, he gave itone tremendous wrench that snapped the plaited leathern thongs that heldit as though they were skeins of thread. Then, grinding his teeth aswith a spasm, he struck as he had never struck before--once, twice,thrice full upon the front of the helmet. Crash! crash! And then, evenas the Earl toppled sidelong, crash! And the iron plates split andcrackled under the third blow. Myles had one flashing glimpse of anawful face, and then the saddle was empty.Then, as he held tight to the horse, panting, dizzy, sick to death, hefelt the hot blood gushing from his side, filling his body armor, andstaining the ground upon which he stood. Still he held tightly to thesaddle-bow of the fallen man\'s horse until, through his glimmeringsight, he saw the Marshal, the Lieutenant, and the attendants gatheraround him. He heard the Marshal ask him, in a voice that sounded faintand distant, if he was dangerously wounded. He did not answer, and oneof the attendants, leaping from his horse, opened the umbril of hishelmet, disclosing the dull, hollow eyes, the ashy, colorless lips, andthe waxy forehead, upon which stood great beads of sweat.""Water! water!"" he cried, hoarsely; ""give me to drink!"" Then, quittinghis hold upon the horse, he started blindly across the lists towards thegate of the barrier. A shadow that chilled his heart seemed to fall uponhim. ""It is death,"" he muttered; then he stopped, then swayed for aninstant, and then toppled headlong, crashing as he fell.CONCLUSIONBut Myles was not dead. Those who had seen his face when the umbril ofthe helmet was raised, and then saw him fall as he tottered across thelists, had at first thought so. But his faintness was more from lossof blood and the sudden unstringing of nerve and sense from the intensefurious strain of the last few moments of battle than from the vitalnature of the wound. Indeed, after Myles had been carried out of thelists and laid upon the ground in the shade between the barriers,Master Thomas, the Prince\'s barber-surgeon, having examined the wounds,declared that he might be even carried on a covered litter to ScotlandYard without serious danger. The Prince was extremely desirous of havinghim under his care, and so the venture was tried. Myles was carried toScotland Yard, and perhaps was none the worse therefore. The Prince, theEarl of Mackworth, and two or three others stood silently watching asthe worthy shaver and leecher, assisted by his apprentice and Gascoyne,washed and bathed the great gaping wound in the side, and bound it withlinen bandages. Myles lay with closed eyelids, still, pallid, weak asa little child. Presently he opened his eyes and turned them, dull andlanguid, to the Prince.""What hath happed my father, my Lord?"" said he, in a faint, whisperingvoice.""Thou hath saved his life and honor, Myles,"" the Prince answered. ""Heis here now, and thy mother hath been sent for, and cometh anon with thepriest who was with them this morn.""Myles dropped his eyelids again; his lips moved, but he made no sound,and then two bright tears trickled across his white cheek.""He maketh a woman of me,"" the Prince muttered through his teeth, andthen, swinging on his heel, he stood for a long time looking out of thewindow into the garden beneath.""May I see my father?"" said Myles, presently, without opening his eyes.The Prince turned around and looked inquiringly at the surgeon.The good man shook his head. ""Not to-day,"" said he; ""haply to-morrow hemay see him and his mother. The bleeding is but new stanched, and suchmatters as seeing his father and mother may make the heart to swell, andso maybe the wound burst afresh and he die. An he would hope to live, hemust rest quiet until to-morrow day.""But though Myles\'s wound was not mortal, it was very serious. The feverwhich followed lingered longer than common--perhaps because of the hotweather--and the days stretched to weeks, and the weeks to months, andstill he lay there, nursed by his mother and Gascoyne and Prior Edward,and now and again by Sir James Lee.One day, a little before the good priest returned to Saint Mary\'sPriory, as he sat by Myles\'s bedside, his hands folded, and his sightturned inward, the young man suddenly said, ""Tell me, holy father, is italways wrong for man to slay man?""The good priest sat silent for so long a time that Myles began to thinkhe had not heard the question. But by-and-by he answered, almost with asigh, ""It is a hard question, my son, but I must in truth say, meseemsit is not always wrong.""""Sir,"" said Myles, ""I have been in battle when men were slain, but neverdid I think thereon as I have upon this matter. Did I sin in so slayingmy father\'s enemy?""""Nay,"" said Prior Edward, quietly, ""thou didst not sin. It was forothers thou didst fight, my son, and for others it is pardonable to dobattle. Had it been thine own quarrel, it might haply have been morehard to have answered thee.""Who can gainsay, even in these days of light, the truth of this that thegood priest said to the sick lad so far away in the past?One day the Earl of Mackworth came to visit Myles. At that time theyoung knight was mending, and was sitting propped up with pillows, andwas wrapped in Sir James Lee\'s cloak, for the day was chilly. After alittle time of talk, a pause of silence fell.""My Lord,"" said Myles, suddenly, ""dost thou remember one part of amatter we spoke of when I first came from France?""The Earl made no pretence of ignorance. ""I remember,"" said he, quietly,looking straight into the young man\'s thin white face.""And have I yet won the right to ask for the Lady Alice de Mowbray towife?"" said Myles, the red rising faintly to his cheeks.""Thou hast won it,"" said the Earl, with a smile.Myles\'s eyes shone and his lips trembled with the pang of sudden joyand triumph, for he was still very weak. ""My Lord,"" said he, presently""belike thou camest here to see me for this very matter?""The Earl smiled again without answering, and Myles knew that he hadguessed aright. He reached out one of his weak, pallid hands frombeneath the cloak. The Earl of Mackworth took it with a firm pressure,then instantly quitting it again, rose, as if ashamed of his emotion,stamped his feet, as though in pretence of being chilled, and thencrossed the room to where the fire crackled brightly in the great stonefireplace.Little else remains to be told; only a few loose strands to tie, and thestory is complete.Though Lord Falworth was saved from death at the block, though his honorwas cleansed from stain, he was yet as poor and needy as ever. TheKing, in spite of all the pressure brought to bear upon him, refused torestore the estates of Falworth and Easterbridge--the latter of whichhad again reverted to the crown upon the death of the Earl of Albanwithout issue--upon the grounds that they had been forfeited not becauseof the attaint of treason, but because of Lord Falworth having refusedto respond to the citation of the courts. So the business dragged alongfor month after month, until in January the King died suddenly in theJerusalem Chamber at Westminster. Then matters went smoothly enough, andFalworth and Mackworth swam upon the flood-tide of fortune.So Myles was married, for how else should the story end? And one dayhe brought his beautiful young wife home to Falworth Castle, which hisfather had given him for his own, and at the gateway of which he was metby Sir James Lee and by the newly-knighted Sir Francis Gascoyne.One day, soon after this home-coming, as he stood with her at an openwindow into which came blowing the pleasant May-time breeze, he suddenlysaid, ""What didst thou think of me when I first fell almost into thylap, like an apple from heaven?""""I thought thou wert a great, good-hearted boy, as I think thou artnow,"" said she, twisting his strong, sinewy fingers in and out.""If thou thoughtst me so then, what a very fool I must have looked tothee when I so clumsily besought thee for thy favor for my jousting atDevlen. Did I not so?""""Thou didst look to me the most noble, handsome young knight that didever live; thou didst look to me Sir Galahad, as they did call thee,withouten taint or stain.""Myles did not even smile in answer, but looked at his wife with such alook that she blushed a rosy red. Then, laughing, she slipped from hishold, and before he could catch her again was gone.I am glad that he was to be rich and happy and honored and beloved afterall his hard and noble fighting.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Men of Iron, by Howard Pyle END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MEN OF IRON ** This file should be named 1557.txt or 1557.zip **This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/5/1557/Produced by Charles Keller and David WidgerUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

83,3,Chapter 3,"['I.THE ARRESTSThe two boats fastened to the little pier that jutted out from thegarden lay rocking in its shadow. Here and there lighted windowsshowed through the thick mist on the margins of the lake. TheEnghien Casino opposite blazed with light, though it was late inthe season, the end of September. A few stars appeared through theclouds. A light breeze ruffled the surface of the water.Arsène Lupin left the summer-house where he was smoking a cigarand, bending forward at the end of the pier:“Growler?” he asked. “Masher?... Are you there?”A man rose from each of the boats, and one of them answered:“Yes, governor.”“Get ready. I hear the car coming with Gilbert and Vaucheray.”He crossed the garden, walked round a house in process ofconstruction, the scaffolding of which loomed overhead, andcautiously opened the door on the Avenue de Ceinture. He was notmistaken: a bright light flashed round the bend and a large, openmotor-car drew up, whence sprang two men in great-coats, with thecollars turned up, and caps.It was Gilbert and Vaucheray: Gilbert, a young fellow of twenty ortwenty-two, with an attractive cast of features and a supple andsinewy frame; Vaucheray, older, shorter, with grizzled hair and apale, sickly face.“Well,” asked Lupin, “did you see him, the deputy?”“Yes, governor,” said Gilbert, “we saw him take the 7.40 tram forParis, as we knew he would.”“Then we are free to act?”“Absolutely. The Villa Marie-Thérèse is ours to do as we pleasewith.”The chauffeur had kept his seat. Lupin gave him his orders:“Don’t wait here. It might attract attention. Be back at half-pastnine exactly, in time to load the car unless the whole businessfalls through.”“Why should it fall through?” observed Gilbert.The motor drove away; and Lupin, taking the road to the lake withhis two companions, replied:“Why? Because I didn’t prepare the plan; and, when I don’t do athing myself, I am only half-confident.”“Nonsense, governor! I’ve been working with you for three yearsnow.... I’m beginning to know the ropes!”“Yes, my lad, you’re beginning,” said Lupin, “and that’s justwhy I’m afraid of blunders.... Here, get in with me.... And you,Vaucheray, take the other boat.... That’s it.... And now push off,boys . . . and make as little noise as you can.”Growler and Masher, the two oarsmen, made straight for the oppositebank, a little to the left of the casino.They met a boat containing a couple locked in each other’s arms,floating at random, and another in which a number of people weresinging at the top of their voices. And that was all.Lupin shifted closer to his companion and said, under his breath:“Tell me, Gilbert, did you think of this job, or was it Vaucheray’sidea?”“Upon my word, I couldn’t tell you: we’ve both of us been discussingit for weeks.”“The thing is, I don’t trust Vaucheray: he’s a low ruffian whenone gets to know him.... I can’t make out why I don’t get rid ofhim....”“Oh, governor!”“Yes, yes, I mean what I say: he’s a dangerous fellow, to saynothing of the fact that he has some rather serious peccadilloes onhis conscience.”He sat silent for a moment and continued:“So you’re quite sure that you saw Daubrecq the deputy?”“Saw him with my own eyes, governor.”“And you know that he has an appointment in Paris?”“He’s going to the theatre.”“Very well; but his servants have remained behind at the Enghienvilla....”“The cook has been sent away. As for the valet, Léonard, who isDaubrecq’s confidential man, he’ll wait for his master in Paris.They can’t get back from town before one o’clock in the morning.But....”“But what?”“We must reckon with a possible freak of fancy on Daubrecq’s part,a change of mind, an unexpected return, and so arrange to haveeverything finished and done with in an hour.”“And when did you get these details?”“This morning. Vaucheray and I at once thought that it was afavourable moment. I selected the garden of the unfinished housewhich we have just left as the best place to start from; for thehouse is not watched at night. I sent for two mates to row theboats; and I telephoned to you. That’s the whole story.”“Have you the keys?”“The keys of the front-door.”“Is that the villa which I see from here, standing in its owngrounds?”“Yes, the Villa Marie-Thérèse; and as the two others, with thegardens touching it on either side, have been unoccupied since thisday week, we shall be able to remove what we please at our leisure;and I swear to you, governor, it’s well worth while.”“The job’s much too simple,” mumbled Lupin. “No charm about it!”They landed in a little creek whence rose a few stone steps, undercover of a mouldering roof. Lupin reflected that shipping thefurniture would be easy work. But, suddenly, he said:“There are people at the villa. Look . . . a light.”“It’s a gas-jet, governor. The light’s not moving.”The Growler stayed by the boats, with instructions to keep watch,while the Masher, the other rower, went to the gate on the Avenuede Ceinture, and Lupin and his two companions crept in the shadowto the foot of the steps.Gilbert went up first. Groping in the dark, he inserted first thebig door-key and then the latch-key. Both turned easily in theirlocks, the door opened and the three men walked in.A gas-jet was flaring in the hall.“You see, governor....” said Gilbert.“Yes, yes,” said Lupin, in a low voice, “but it seems to me that thelight which I saw shining did not come from here....”“Where did it come from then?”“I can’t say.... Is this the drawing-room?”“No,” replied Gilbert, who was not afraid to speak pretty loudly,“no. By way of precaution, he keeps everything on the first floor,in his bedroom and in the two rooms on either side of it.”“And where is the staircase?”“On the right, behind the curtain.”Lupin moved to the curtain and was drawing the hanging aside when,suddenly, at four steps on the left, a door opened and a headappeared, a pallid man’s head, with terrified eyes.“Help! Murder!” shouted the man.And he rushed back into the room.“It’s Léonard, the valet!” cried Gilbert.“If he makes a fuss, I’ll out him,” growled Vaucheray.“You’ll jolly well do nothing of the sort, do you hear, Vaucheray?”said Lupin, peremptorily. And he darted off in pursuit of theservant. He first went through a dining-room, where he saw a lampstill lit, with plates and a bottle around it, and he found Léonardat the further end of a pantry, making vain efforts to open thewindow:“Don’t move, sportie! No kid! Ah, the brute!”He had thrown himself flat on the floor, on seeing Léonard raisehis arm at him. Three shots were fired in the dusk of the pantry;and then the valet came tumbling to the ground, seized by the legsby Lupin, who snatched his weapon from him and gripped him by thethroat:“Get out, you dirty brute!” he growled. “He very nearly did forme.... Here, Vaucheray, secure this gentleman!”He threw the light of his pocket-lantern on the servant’s face andchuckled:“He’s not a pretty gentleman either.... You can’t have a very clearconscience, Léonard; besides, to play flunkey to Daubrecq thedeputy...! Have you finished, Vaucheray? I don’t want to hang abouthere for ever!”“There’s no danger, governor,” said Gilbert.“Oh, really?... So you think that shots can’t be heard?...”“Quite impossible.”“No matter, we must look sharp. Vaucheray, take the lamp and let’sgo upstairs.”He took Gilbert by the arm and, as he dragged him to the firstfloor:“You ass,” he said, “is that the way you make inquiries? Wasn’t Iright to have my doubts?”“Look here, governor, I couldn’t know that he would change his mindand come back to dinner.”“One’s got to know everything when one has the honour of breakinginto people’s houses. You numskull! I’ll remember you andVaucheray . . . a nice pair of gossoons!...”The sight of the furniture on the first floor pacified Lupin and hestarted on his inventory with the satisfied air of a collector whohas looked in to treat himself to a few works of art:“By Jingo! There’s not much of it, but what there is is pucka!There’s nothing the matter with this representative of the peoplein the question of taste. Four Aubusson chairs.... A bureau signed‘Percier-Fontaine,’ for a wager.... Two inlays by Gouttières.... Agenuine Fragonard and a sham Nattier which any American millionairewill swallow for the asking: in short, a fortune.... And there arecurmudgeons who pretend that there’s nothing but faked stuff left.Dash it all, why don’t they do as I do? They should look about!”Gilbert and Vaucheray, following Lupin’s orders and instructions,at once proceeded methodically to remove the bulkier pieces. Thefirst boat was filled in half an hour; and it was decided that theGrowler and the Masher should go on ahead and begin to load themotor-car.Lupin went to see them start. On returning to the house, it struckhim, as he passed through the hall, that he heard a voice in thepantry. He went there and found Léonard lying flat on his stomach,quite alone, with his hands tied behind his back:“So it’s you growling, my confidential flunkey? Don’t get excited:it’s almost finished. Only, if you make too much noise, you’lloblige us to take severer measures.... Do you like pears? We mightgive you one, you know: a choke-pear!...”As he went upstairs, he again heard the same sound and, stopping tolisten, he caught these words, uttered in a hoarse, groaning voice,which came, beyond a doubt, from the pantry:“Help!... Murder!... Help!... I shall be killed!... Inform thecommissary!”“The fellow’s clean off his chump!” muttered Lupin. “By Jove!... Todisturb the police at nine o’clock in the evening: there’s a notionfor you!”He set to work again. It took longer than he expected, for theydiscovered in the cupboards all sorts of valuable knick-knackswhich it would have been very wrong to disdain and, on the otherhand, Vaucheray and Gilbert were going about their investigationswith signs of laboured concentration that nonplussed him.At long last, he lost his patience:“That will do!” he said. “We’re not going to spoil the whole joband keep the motor waiting for the sake of the few odd bits thatremain. I’m taking the boat.”They were now by the waterside and Lupin went down the steps.Gilbert held him back:“I say, governor, we want one more look round five minutes, nolonger.”“But what for, dash it all?”“Well, it’s like this: we were told of an old reliquary, somethingstunning....”“Well?”“We can’t lay our hands on it. And I was thinking.... There’s acupboard with a big lock to it in the pantry.... You see, we can’tvery well....”He was already on his way to the villa. Vaucheray ran back too.“I’ll give you ten minutes, not a second longer!” cried Lupin. “Inten minutes, I’m off.”But the ten minutes passed and he was still waiting.He looked at his watch:“A quarter-past nine,” he said to himself. “This is madness.”And he also remembered that Gilbert and Vaucheray had behavedrather queerly throughout the removal of the things, keepingclose together and apparently watching each other. What could behappening?Lupin mechanically returned to the house, urged by a feeling ofanxiety which he was unable to explain; and, at the same time,he listened to a dull sound which rose in the distance, from thedirection of Enghien, and which seemed to be coming nearer....People strolling about, no doubt....He gave a sharp whistle and then went to the main gate, to takea glance down the avenue. But, suddenly, as he was opening thegate, a shot rang out, followed by a yell of pain. He returned ata run, went round the house, leapt up the steps and rushed to thedining-room:“Blast it all, what are you doing there, you two?”Gilbert and Vaucheray, locked in a furious embrace, were rolling onthe floor, uttering cries of rage. Their clothes were dripping withblood. Lupin flew at them to separate them. But already Gilbert hadgot his adversary down and was wrenching out of his hand somethingwhich Lupin had no time to see. And Vaucheray, who was losing bloodthrough a wound in the shoulder, fainted.“Who hurt him? You, Gilbert?” asked Lupin, furiously.“No, Léonard.”“Léonard? Why, he was tied up!”“He undid his fastenings and got hold of his revolver.”“The scoundrel! Where is he?”Lupin took the lamp and went into the pantry.The man-servant was lying on his back, with his arms outstretched, adagger stuck in his throat and a livid face. A red stream trickledfrom his mouth.“Ah,” gasped Lupin, after examining him, “he’s dead!”“Do you think so?... Do you think so?” stammered Gilbert, in atrembling voice.“He’s dead, I tell you.”“It was Vaucheray . . . it was Vaucheray who did it....”Pale with anger, Lupin caught hold of him:“It was Vaucheray, was it?... And you too, you blackguard, sinceyou were there and didn’t stop him! Blood! Blood! You know I won’thave it.... Well, it’s a bad lookout for you, my fine fellows....You’ll have to pay the damage! And you won’t get off cheaplyeither.... Mind the guillotine!” And, shaking him violently, “Whatwas it? Why did he kill him?”“He wanted to go through his pockets and take the key of thecupboard from him. When he stooped over him, he saw that the manunloosed his arms. He got frightened . . . and he stabbed him....”“But the revolver-shot?”“It was Léonard . . . he had his revolver in his hand . . . he justhad strength to take aim before he died....”“And the key of the cupboard?”“Vaucheray took it....”“Did he open it?”“And did he find what he was after?”“Yes.”“And you wanted to take the thing from him. What sort of thing wasit? The reliquary? No, it was too small for that.... Then what wasit? Answer me, will you?...”Lupin gathered from Gilbert’s silence and the determined expressionon his face that he would not obtain a reply. With a threateninggesture, “I’ll make you talk, my man. Sure as my name’s Lupin, youshall come out with it. But, for the moment, we must see aboutdecamping. Here, help me. We must get Vaucheray into the boat....”They had returned to the dining-room and Gilbert was bending overthe wounded man, when Lupin stopped him:“Listen.”They exchanged one look of alarm.... Some one was speaking inthe pantry . . . a very low, strange, very distant voice....Nevertheless, as they at once made certain, there was no one in theroom, no one except the dead man, whose dark outline lay stretchedupon the floor.And the voice spake anew, by turns shrill, stifled, bleating,stammering, yelling, fearsome. It uttered indistinct words, brokensyllables.Lupin felt the top of his head covering with perspiration. What wasthis incoherent voice, mysterious as a voice from beyond the grave?He had knelt down by the man-servant’s side. The voice was silentand then began again:“Give us a better light,” he said to Gilbert.He was trembling a little, shaken with a nervous dread which he wasunable to master, for there was no doubt possible: when Gilberthad removed the shade from the lamp, Lupin realized that the voiceissued from the corpse itself, without a movement of the lifelessmass, without a quiver of the bleeding mouth.“Governor, I’ve got the shivers,” stammered Gilbert.Again the same voice, the same snuffling whisper.Suddenly, Lupin burst out laughing, seized the corpse and pulled itaside:“Exactly!” he said, catching sight of an object made of polishedmetal. “Exactly! That’s it!... Well, upon my word, it took me longenough!”On the spot on the floor which he had uncovered lay the receiver ofa telephone, the cord of which ran up to the apparatus fixed on thewall, at the usual height.Lupin put the receiver to his ear. The noise began again at once,but it was a mixed noise, made up of different calls, exclamations,confused cries, the noise produced by a number of personsquestioning one another at the same time.“Are you there?... He won’t answer. It’s awful.... They must havekilled him. What is it?... Keep up your courage. There’s help onthe way . . . police . . . soldiers....”“Dash it!” said Lupin, dropping the receiver.The truth appeared to him in a terrifying vision. Quite at thebeginning, while the things upstairs were being moved, Léonard,whose bonds were not securely fastened, had contrived toscramble to his feet, to unhook the receiver, probably with histeeth, to drop it and to appeal for assistance to the Enghientelephone-exchange.And those were the words which Lupin had overheard, after the firstboat started:“Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!”And this was the reply of the exchange. The police were hurrying tothe spot. And Lupin remembered the sounds which he had heard fromthe garden, four or five minutes earlier, at most:“The police! Take to your heels!” he shouted, darting across thedining room.“What about Vaucheray?” asked Gilbert.“Sorry, can’t be helped!”But Vaucheray, waking from his torpor, entreated him as he passed:“Governor, you wouldn’t leave me like this!”Lupin stopped, in spite of the danger, and was lifting the woundedman, with Gilbert’s assistance, when a loud din arose outside:“Too late!” he said.At that moment, blows shook the hall-door at the back of the house.He ran to the front steps: a number of men had already turned thecorner of the house at a rush. He might have managed to keep aheadof them, with Gilbert, and reach the waterside. But what chance wasthere of embarking and escaping under the enemy’s fire?He locked and bolted the door.“We are surrounded . . . and done for,” spluttered Gilbert.“Hold your tongue,” said Lupin.“But they’ve seen us, governor. There, they’re knocking.”“Hold your tongue,” Lupin repeated. “Not a word. Not a movement.”He himself remained unperturbed, with an utterly calm face andthe pensive attitude of one who has all the time that he needsto examine a delicate situation from every point of view. He hadreached one of those minutes which he called the “superior momentsof existence,” those which alone give a value and a price to life.On such occasions, however threatening the danger, he always beganby counting to himself, slowly--“One.... Two.... Three.... Four....Five.... Six”--until the beating of his heart became normal andregular. Then and not till then, he reflected, but with whatintensity, with what perspicacity, with what a profound intuitionof possibilities! All the factors of the problem were present inhis mind. He foresaw everything. He admitted everything. And hetook his resolution in all logic and in all certainty.After thirty or forty seconds, while the men outside were bangingat the doors and picking the locks, he said to his companion:“Follow me.”Returning to the dining-room, he softly opened the sash and drewthe Venetian blinds of a window in the side-wall. People werecoming and going, rendering flight out of the question.Thereupon he began to shout with all his might, in a breathlessvoice:“This way!... Help!... I’ve got them!... This way!”He pointed his revolver and fired two shots into the tree-tops.Then he went back to Vaucheray, bent over him and smeared hisface and hands with the wounded man’s blood. Lastly, turning uponGilbert, he took him violently by the shoulders and threw him tothe floor.“What do you want, governor? There’s a nice thing to do!”“Let me do as I please,” said Lupin, laying an imperative stress onevery syllable. “I’ll answer for everything.... I’ll answer for thetwo of you.... Let me do as I like with you.... I’ll get you bothout of prison.... But I can only do that if I’m free.”Excited cries rose through the open window.“This way!” he shouted. “I’ve got them! Help!”And, quietly, in a whisper:“Just think for a moment.... Have you anything to say to me?...Something that can be of use to us?”Gilbert was too much taken aback to understand Lupin’s plan and hestruggled furiously. Vaucheray showed more intelligence; moreover,he had given up all hope of escape, because of his wound; and hesnarled:“Let the governor have his way, you ass!... As long as he gets off,isn’t that the great thing?”Suddenly, Lupin remembered the article which Gilbert had put in hispocket, after capturing it from Vaucheray. He now tried to take itin his turn.“No, not that! Not if I know it!” growled Gilbert, managing torelease himself.Lupin floored him once more. But two men suddenly appeared at thewindow; and Gilbert yielded and, handing the thing to Lupin, whopocketed it without looking at it, whispered:“Here you are, governor.... I’ll explain. You can be sure that....”He did not have time to finish.... Two policemen and others afterthem and soldiers who entered through every door and window came toLupin’s assistance.Gilbert was at once seized and firmly bound. Lupin withdrew:“I’m glad you’ve come,” he said. “The beggar’s given me a lot oftrouble. I wounded the other; but this one....”The commissary of police asked him, hurriedly:“Have you seen the man-servant? Have they killed him?”“I don’t know,” he answered.“You don’t know?...”“Why, I came with you from Enghien, on hearing of the murder! Only,while you were going round the left of the house, I went round theright. There was a window open. I climbed up just as these tworuffians were about to jump down. I fired at this one,” pointing toVaucheray, “and seized hold of his pal.”How could he have been suspected? He was covered with blood. Hehad handed over the valet’s murderers. Half a score of people hadwitnessed the end of the heroic combat which he had delivered.Besides, the uproar was too great for any one to take the troubleto argue or to waste time in entertaining doubts. In the heightof the first confusion, the people of the neighbourhood invadedthe villa. One and all lost their heads. They ran to every side,upstairs, downstairs, to the very cellar. They asked one anotherquestions, yelled and shouted; and no one dreamt of checkingLupin’s statements, which sounded so plausible.However, the discovery of the body in the pantry restored thecommissary to a sense of his responsibility. He issued orders,had the house cleared and placed policemen at the gate to preventany one from passing in or out. Then, without further delay,he examined the spot and began his inquiry. Vaucheray gave hisname; Gilbert refused to give his, on the plea that he would onlyspeak in the presence of a lawyer. But, when he was accused ofthe murder, he informed against Vaucheray, who defended himselfby denouncing the other; and the two of them vociferated at thesame time, with the evident wish to monopolize the commissary’sattention. When the commissary turned to Lupin, to request hisevidence, he perceived that the stranger was no longer there.Without the least suspicion, he said to one of the policemen:“Go and tell that gentleman that I should like to ask him a fewquestions.”They looked about for the gentleman. Some one had seen him standingon the steps, lighting a cigarette. The next news was that he hadgiven cigarettes to a group of soldiers and strolled toward thelake, saying that they were to call him if he was wanted.They called him. No one replied.But a soldier came running up. The gentleman had just got intoa boat and was rowing away for all he was worth. The commissarylooked at Gilbert and realized that he had been tricked:“Stop him!” he shouted. “Fire on him! He’s an accomplice!...”He himself rushed out, followed by two policemen, while the othersremained with the prisoners. On reaching the bank, he saw thegentleman, a hundred yards away, taking off his hat to him in thedusk.One of the policemen discharged his revolver, without thinking.The wind carried the sound of words across the water. The gentlemanwas singing as he rowed:      “Go, little bark,      Float in the dark....”But the commissary saw a skiff fastened to the landing-stage ofthe adjoining property. He scrambled over the hedge separating thetwo gardens and, after ordering the soldiers to watch the banks ofthe lake and to seize the fugitive if he tried to put ashore, thecommissary and two of his men pulled off in pursuit of Lupin.It was not a difficult matter, for they were able to follow hismovements by the intermittent light of the moon and to see that hewas trying to cross the lakes while bearing toward the right--thatis to say, toward the village of Saint-Gratien. Moreover, thecommissary soon perceived that, with the aid of his men and thanksperhaps to the comparative lightness of his craft, he was rapidlygaining on the other. In ten minutes he had decreased the intervalbetween them by one half.“That’s it!” he cried. “We shan’t even need the soldiers tokeep him from landing. I very much want to make the fellow’sacquaintance. He’s a cool hand and no mistake!”The funny thing was that the distance was now diminishing at anabnormal rate, as though the fugitive had lost heart at realizingthe futility of the struggle. The policemen redoubled theirefforts. The boat shot across the water with the swiftness of aswallow. Another hundred yards at most and they would reach the man.“Halt!” cried the commissary.The enemy, whose huddled shape they could make out in the boat,no longer moved. The sculls drifted with the stream. And thisabsence of all motion had something alarming about it. A ruffian ofthat stamp might easily lie in wait for his aggressors, sell hislife dearly and even shoot them dead before they had a chance ofattacking him.“Surrender!” shouted the commissary.The sky, at that moment, was dark. The three men lay flat atthe bottom of their skiff, for they thought they perceived athreatening gesture.The boat, carried by its own impetus, was approaching the other.The commissary growled:“We won’t let ourselves be sniped. Let’s fire at him. Are youready?” And he roared, once more, “Surrender . . . if not...!”No reply.The enemy did not budge.“Surrender!... Hands up!... You refuse?... So much the worse foryou.... I’m counting.... One.... Two....”The policemen did not wait for the word of command. They fired and,at once, bending over their oars, gave the boat so powerful animpulse that it reached the goal in a few strokes.The commissary watched, revolver in hand, ready for the leastmovement. He raised his arm:“If you stir, I’ll blow out your brains!”But the enemy did not stir for a moment; and, when the boat wasbumped and the two men, letting go their oars, prepared for theformidable assault, the commissary understood the reason of thispassive attitude: there was no one in the boat. The enemy hadescaped by swimming, leaving in the hands of the victor a certainnumber of the stolen articles, which, heaped up and surmountedby a jacket and a bowler hat, might be taken, at a pinch, in thesemi-darkness, vaguely to represent the figure of a man.They struck matches and examined the enemy’s cast clothes. Therewere no initials in the hat. The jacket contained neither papersnor pocketbook. Nevertheless, they made a discovery which wasdestined to give the case no little celebrity and which had aterrible influence on the fate of Gilbert and Vaucheray: in oneof the pockets was a visiting-card which the fugitive had leftbehind . . . the card of Arsène Lupin.At almost the same moment, while the police, towing the capturedskiff behind them, continued their empty search and while thesoldiers stood drawn up on the bank, straining their eyes to tryand follow the fortunes of the naval combat, the aforesaid ArsèneLupin was quietly landing at the very spot which he had left twohours earlier.He was there met by his two other accomplices, the Growler and theMasher, flung them a few sentences by way of explanation, jumpedinto the motor-car, among Daubrecq the deputy’s armchairs and othervaluables, wrapped himself in his furs and drove, by desertedroads, to his repository at Neuilly, where he left the chauffeur. Ataxicab brought him back to Paris and put him down by the church ofSaint-Philippe-du-Roule, not far from which, in the Rue Matignon,he had a flat, on the entresol-floor, of which none of his gang,excepting Gilbert, knew, a flat with a private entrance. He wasglad to take off his clothes and rub himself down; for, in spite ofhis strong constitution, he felt chilled to the bone. On retiringto bed, he emptied the contents of his pockets, as usual, on themantel-piece. It was not till then that he noticed, near hispocketbook and his keys, the object which Gilbert had put into hishand at the last moment.And he was very much surprised. It was a decanter-stopper, alittle crystal stopper, like those used for the bottles in aliqueur-stand. And this crystal stopper had nothing particularabout it. The most that Lupin observed was that the knob, with itsmany facets, was gilded right down to the indent. But, to tellthe truth, this detail did not seem to him of a nature to attractspecial notice.“And it was this bit of glass to which Gilbert and Vaucherayattached such stubborn importance!” he said to himself. “It was forthis that they killed the valet, fought each other, wasted theirtime, risked prison . . . trial . . . the scaffold!...”Too tired to linger further upon this matter, exciting though itappeared to him, he replaced the stopper on the chimney-piece andgot into bed.He had bad dreams. Gilbert and Vaucheray were kneeling on theflags of their cells, wildly stretching out their hands to him andyelling with fright:“Help!... Help!” they cried.But, notwithstanding all his efforts, he was unable to move. Hehimself was fastened by invisible bonds. And, trembling, obsessedby a monstrous vision, he watched the dismal preparations, thecutting of the condemned men’s hair and shirt-collars, the squalidtragedy.“By Jove!” he said, when he woke after a series of nightmares.“There’s a lot of bad omens! Fortunately, we don’t err on the sideof superstition. Otherwise...!” And he added, “For that matter,we have a talisman which, to judge by Gilbert and Vaucheray’sbehaviour, should be enough, with Lupin’s help, to frustrate badluck and secure the triumph of the good cause. Let’s have a look atthat crystal stopper!”He sprang out of bed to take the thing and examine it more closely.An exclamation escaped him. The crystal stopper had disappeared....']"
83,4,Chapter 4,"['II.EIGHT FROM NINE LEAVES ONENotwithstanding my friendly relations with Lupin and the manyflattering proofs of his confidence which he has given me, there isone thing which I have never been quite able to fathom, and that isthe organization of his gang.The existence of the gang is an undoubted fact. Certain adventurescan be explained only by countless acts of devotion, invincibleefforts of energy and powerful cases of complicity, representing somany forces which all obey one mighty will. But how is this willexerted? Through what intermediaries, through what subordinates?That is what I do not know. Lupin keeps his secret; and the secretswhich Lupin chooses to keep are, so to speak, impenetrable.The only supposition which I can allow myself to make is thatthis gang, which, in my opinion, is very limited in numbers andtherefore all the more formidable, is completed and extendedindefinitely by the addition of independent units, provisionalassociates, picked up in every class of society and in everycountry of the world, who are the executive agents of an authoritywith which, in many cases, they are not even acquainted. Thecompanions, the initiates, the faithful adherents--men who play theleading parts under the direct command of Lupin--move to and frobetween these secondary agents and the master.Gilbert and Vaucheray evidently belonged to the main gang. And thatis why the law showed itself so implacable in their regard. For thefirst time, it held accomplices of Lupin in its clutches--declared,undisputed accomplices--and those accomplices had committed amurder. If the murder was premeditated, if the accusation ofdeliberate homicide could be supported by substantial proofs,it meant the scaffold. Now there was, at the very least, oneself-evident proof, the cry for assistance which Léonard had sentover the telephone a few minutes before his death:“Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!...”The desperate appeal had been heard by two men, the operator onduty and one of his fellow-clerks, who swore to it positively. Andit was in consequence of this appeal that the commissary of police,who was at once informed, had proceeded to the Villa Marie-Thérèse,escorted by his men and a number of soldiers off duty.Lupin had a very clear notion of the danger from the first. Thefierce struggle in which he had engaged against society wasentering upon a new and terrible phase. His luck was turning.It was no longer a matter of attacking others, but of defendinghimself and saving the heads of his two companions.A little memorandum, which I have copied from one of the note-booksin which he often jots down a summary of the situations thatperplex him, will show us the workings of his brain:    “One definite fact, to begin with, is that Gilbert and Vaucheray    humbugged me. The Enghien expedition, undertaken ostensibly with    the object of robbing the Villa Marie-Thérèse, had a secret    purpose. This purpose obsessed their minds throughout the    operations; and what they were looking for, under the furniture    and in the cupboards, was one thing and one thing alone: the    crystal stopper. Therefore, if I want to see clear ahead, I must    first of all know what this means. It is certain that, for some    hidden reason, that mysterious piece of glass possesses an    incalculable value in their eyes. And not only in theirs, for,    last night, some one was bold enough and clever enough to enter    my flat and steal the object in question from me.”This theft of which he was the victim puzzled Lupin curiously.Two problems, both equally difficult of solution, presentedthemselves to his mind. First, who was the mysterious visitor?Gilbert, who enjoyed his entire confidence and acted as his privatesecretary, was the only one who knew of the retreat in the RueMatignon. Now Gilbert was in prison. Was Lupin to suppose thatGilbert had betrayed him and put the police on his tracks? Inthat case, why were they content with taking the crystal stopper,instead of arresting him, Lupin?But there was something much stranger still. Admitting that theyhad been able to force the doors of his flat--and this he wascompelled to admit, though there was no mark to show it--how hadthey succeeded in entering the bedroom? He turned the key andpushed the bolt as he did every evening, in accordance with a habitfrom which he never departed. And, nevertheless--the fact wasundeniable--the crystal stopper had disappeared without the lock orthe bolt having been touched. And, although Lupin flattered himselfthat he had sharp ears, even when asleep, not a sound had waked him!He took no great pains to probe the mystery. He knew those problemstoo well to hope that this one could be solved other than in thecourse of events. But, feeling very much put out and exceedinglyuneasy, he then and there locked up his entresol flat in the RueMatignon and swore that he would never set foot in it again.And he applied himself forthwith to the question of correspondingwith Vaucheray or Gilbert.Here a fresh disappointment awaited him. It was so clearlyunderstood, both at the Santé Prison and at the Law Courts,that all communication between Lupin and the prisoners must beabsolutely prevented, that a multitude of minute precautions wereordered by the prefect of police and minutely observed by thelowest subordinates. Tried policemen, always the same men, watchedGilbert and Vaucheray, day and night, and never let them out oftheir sight.Lupin, at this time, had not yet promoted himself to thecrowning honour of his career, the post of chief of thedetective-service,[A] and, consequently, was not able to take stepsat the Law Courts to insure the execution of his plans. After afortnight of fruitless endeavours, he was obliged to bow.He did so with a raging heart and a growing sense of anxiety.“The difficult part of a business,” he often says, “is not thefinish, but the start.”Where was he to start in the present circumstances? What road washe to follow?His thoughts recurred to Daubrecq the deputy, the original ownerof the crystal stopper, who probably knew its importance. On theother hand, how was Gilbert aware of the doings and mode of life ofDaubrecq the deputy? What means had he employed to keep him underobservation? Who had told him of the place where Daubrecq spent theevening of that day? These were all interesting questions to solve.Daubrecq had moved to his winter quarters in Paris immediatelyafter the burglary at the Villa Marie-Thérèse and was now living inhis own house, on the left-hand side of the little Square Lamartinethat opens out at the end of the Avenue Victor-Hugo.First disguising himself as an old gentleman of private means,strolling about, cane in hand, Lupin spent his time in theneighbourhood, on the benches of the square and the avenue. Hemade a discovery on the first day. Two men, dressed as workmen,but behaving in a manner that left no doubt as to their aims, werewatching the deputy’s house. When Daubrecq went out, they set offin pursuit of him; and they were immediately behind him when hecame home again. At night, as soon as the lights were out, theywent away.Lupin shadowed them in his turn. They were detective-officers.“Hullo, hullo!” he said to himself. “This is hardly what Iexpected. So the Daubrecq bird is under suspicion?”But, on the fourth day, at nightfall, the two men were joined bysix others, who conversed with them in the darkest part of theSquare Lamartine. And, among these new arrivals, Lupin was vastlyastonished to recognize, by his figure and bearing, the famousPrasville, the erstwhile barrister, sportsman and explorer, nowfavourite at the Élysée, who, for some mysterious reason, had beenpitchforked into the headquarters of police as secretary-general,with the reversion of the prefecture.And, suddenly, Lupin remembered: two years ago, Prasville andDaubrecq the deputy had had a personal encounter on the Place duPalais-Bourbon. The incident made a great stir at the time. No oneknew the cause of it. Prasville had sent his seconds to Daubrecq onthe same day; but Daubrecq refused to fight.A little while later, Prasville was appointed secretary-general.“Very odd, very odd,” said Lupin, who remained plunged in thought,while continuing to observe Prasville’s movements.At seven o’clock Prasville’s group of men moved away a few yards,in the direction of the Avenue Henri-Martin. The door of a smallgarden on the right of the house opened and Daubrecq appeared. Thetwo detectives followed close behind him and, when he took theRue-Taitbout train, jumped on after him.Prasville at once walked across the square and rang the bell. Thegarden-gate was between the house and the porter’s lodge. Theportress came and opened it. There was a brief conversation, afterwhich Prasville and his companions were admitted.“A domiciliary visit,” said Lupin. “Secret and illegal. By thestrict rules of politeness, I ought to be invited. My presence isindispensable.”Without the least hesitation he went up to the house, the door ofwhich had not been closed, and, passing in front of the portress,who was casting her eyes outside, he asked, in the hurried tones ofa person who is late for an appointment:“Have the gentlemen come?”“Yes, you will find them in the study.”His plan was quite simple: if any one met him, he would pretend tobe a tradesman. But there was no need for this subterfuge. He wasable, after crossing an empty hall, to enter a dining-room whichalso had no one in it, but which, through the panes of a glasspartition that separated the dining-room from the study, affordedhim a view of Prasville and his five companions.Prasville opened all the drawers with the aid of false keys. Next,he examined all the papers, while his companions took down thebooks from the shelves, shook the pages of each separately and feltinside the bindings.“Of course, it’s a paper they’re looking for,” said Lupin.“Bank-notes, perhaps....”Prasville exclaimed:“What rot! We shan’t find a thing!”Yet he obviously did not abandon all hope of discovering what hewanted, for he suddenly seized the four bottles in a liqueur-stand,took out the four stoppers and inspected them.“Hullo!” thought Lupin. “Now he’s going for decanter-stoppers! Thenit’s not a question of a paper? Well, I give it up.”Prasville next lifted and examined different objects; and he asked:“How often have you been here?”“Six times last winter,” was the reply.“And you have searched the house thoroughly?”“Every one of the rooms, for days at a time, while he was visitinghis constituency.”“Still . . . still....” And he added, “Has he no servant at present?”“No, he is looking for one. He has his meals out and the portresskeeps the house as best she can. The woman is devoted to us....”Prasville persisted in his investigations for nearly an hour and ahalf, shifting and fingering all the knick-knacks, but taking careto put everything back exactly where he found it. At nine o’clock,however, the two detectives who had followed Daubrecq burst intothe study:“He’s coming back!”“On foot?”“Yes.”“Have we time?”“Oh, dear, yes!”Prasville and the men from the police-office withdrew, withoutundue haste, after taking a last glance round the room to make surethat there was nothing to betray their visit.The position was becoming critical for Lupin. He ran the risk ofknocking up against Daubrecq, if he went away, or of not beingable to get out, if he remained. But, on ascertaining that thedining-room windows afforded a direct means of exit to the square,he resolved to stay. Besides, the opportunity of obtaining a closeview of Daubrecq was too good to refuse; and, as Daubrecq hadbeen out to dinner, there was not much chance of his entering thedining-room.Lupin, therefore, waited, holding himself ready to hide behind avelvet curtain that could be drawn across the glazed partition incase of need.He heard the sound of doors opening and shutting. Some one walkedinto the study and switched on the light. He recognized Daubrecq.The deputy was a stout, thickset, bull-necked man, very nearlybald, with a fringe of gray whiskers round his chin and wearing apair of black eye-glasses under his spectacles, for his eyes wereweak and strained. Lupin noticed the powerful features, the squarechin, the prominent cheek-bones. The hands were brawny and coveredwith hair, the legs bowed; and he walked with a stoop, bearingfirst on one hip and then on the other, which gave him somethingof the gait of a gorilla. But the face was topped by an enormous,lined forehead, indented with hollows and dotted with bumps.There was something bestial, something savage, something repulsiveabout the man’s whole personality. Lupin remembered that, in theChamber of Deputies, Daubrecq was nicknamed “The Wild Man of theWoods” and that he was so labelled not only because he stood aloofand hardly ever mixed with his fellow-members, but also because ofhis appearance, his behaviour, his peculiar gait and his remarkablemuscular development.He sat down to his desk, took a meerschaum pipe from his pocket,selected a packet of caporal among several packets of tobacco whichlay drying in a bowl, tore open the wrapper, filled his pipe andlit it. Then he began to write letters.Presently he ceased his work and sat thinking, with his attentionfixed on a spot on his desk.He lifted a little stamp-box and examined it. Next, he verifiedthe position of different articles which Prasville had touched andreplaced; and he searched them with his eyes, felt them with hishands, bending over them as though certain signs, known to himselfalone, were able to tell him what he wished to know.Lastly, he grasped the knob on an electric bell-push and rang. Theportress appeared a minute later.He asked:“They’ve been, haven’t they?”And, when the woman hesitated about replying, he insisted:“Come, come, Clémence, did you open this stamp-box?”“No, sir.”“Well, I fastened the lid down with a little strip of gummed paper.The strip has been broken.”“But I assure you, . . .” the woman began.“Why tell lies,” he said, “considering that I myself instructed youto lend yourself to those visits?”“The fact is....”“The fact is that you want to keep on good terms with bothsides.... Very well!” He handed her a fifty-franc note andrepeated, “Have they been?”“Yes.”“The same men as in the spring?”“Yes, all five of them . . . with another one, who ordered themabout.”“A tall, dark man?”“Yes.”Lupin saw Daubrecq’s mouth hardening; and Daubrecq continued:“Is that all?”“There was one more, who came after they did and joined them . . .and then, just now, two more, the pair who usually keep watchoutside the house.”“Did they remain in the study?”“Yes, sir.”“And they went away when I came back? A few minutes before,perhaps?”“Yes, sir.”“That will do.”The woman left the room. Daubrecq returned to his letter-writing.Then, stretching out his arm, he made some marks on a whitewriting-tablet, at the end of his desk, and rested it against thedesk, as though he wished to keep it in sight. The marks werefigures; and Lupin was able to read the following subtraction-sum:    “9 − 8 = 1”And Daubrecq, speaking between his teeth, thoughtfully uttered thesyllables:“Eight from nine leaves one.... There’s not a doubt about that,”he added, aloud. He wrote one more letter, a very short one, andaddressed the envelope with an inscription which Lupin was able todecipher when the letter was placed beside the writing-tablet:  “To Monsieur Prasville,  Secretary-general of the Prefecture of Police.”Then he rang the bell again:“Clémence,” he said, to the portress, “did you go to school as achild?”“Yes, sir, of course I did.”“And were you taught arithmetic?”“Why, sir....”“Well, you’re not very good at subtraction.”“What makes you say that?”“Because you don’t know that nine minus eight equals one. Andthat, you see, is a fact of the highest importance. Life becomesimpossible if you are ignorant of that fundamental truth.”He rose, as he spoke, and walked round the room, with his handsbehind his back, swaying upon his hips. He did so once more. Then,stopping at the dining-room, he opened the door:“For that matter, there’s another way of putting the problem. Takeeight from nine; and one remains. And the one who remains is here,eh? Correct! And monsieur supplies us with a striking proof, doeshe not?”He patted the velvet curtain in which Lupin had hurriedly wrappedhimself:“Upon my word, sir, you must be stifling under this! Not to saythat I might have amused myself by sticking a dagger through thecurtain. Remember Hamlet’s madness and Polonius’ death: ‘How now! Arat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!’ Come along, Mr. Polonius, come outof your hole.”It was one of those positions to which Lupin was not accustomed andwhich he loathed. To catch others in a trap and pull their leg wasall very well; but it was a very different thing to have peopleteasing him and roaring with laughter at his expense. Yet whatcould he answer back?“You look a little pale, Mr. Polonius.... Hullo! Why, it’s therespectable old gentleman who has been hanging about the square forsome days! So you belong to the police too, Mr. Polonius? There,there, pull yourself together, I sha’n’t hurt you!... But you see,Clémence, how right my calculation was. You told me that nine spieshad been to the house. I counted a troop of eight, as I came along,eight of them in the distance, down the avenue. Take eight fromnine and one remains: the one who evidently remained behind to seewhat he could see. _Ecce homo!_”“Well? And then?” said Lupin, who felt a mad craving to fly at thefellow and reduce him to silence.“And then? Nothing at all, my good man.... What more do you want?The farce is over. I will only ask you to take this little note toMaster Prasville, your employer. Clémence, please show Mr. Poloniusout. And, if ever he calls again, fling open the doors wide tohim. Pray look upon this as your home, Mr. Polonius. Your servant,sir!...”Lupin hesitated. He would have liked to talk big and to come outwith a farewell phrase, a parting speech, like an actor makinga showy exit from the stage, and at least to disappear with thehonours of war. But his defeat was so pitiable that he could thinkof nothing better than to bang his hat on his head and stamp hisfeet as he followed the portress down the hall. It was a poorrevenge.“You rascally beggar!” he shouted, once he was outside the door,shaking his fist at Daubrecq’s windows. “Wretch, scum of the earth,deputy, you shall pay for this!... Oh, he allows himself...! Oh, hehas the cheek to...! Well, I swear to you, my fine fellow, that,one of these days....”He was foaming with rage, all the more as, in his innermost heart,he recognized the strength of his new enemy and could not deny themasterly fashion in which he had managed this business. Daubrecq’scoolness, the assurance with which he hoaxed the police-officials,the contempt with which he lent himself to their visits at hishouse and, above all, his wonderful self-possession, his easybearing and the impertinence of his conduct in the presence ofthe ninth person who was spying on him: all this denoted a man ofcharacter, a strong man, with a well-balanced mind, lucid, bold,sure of himself and of the cards in his hand.But what were those cards? What game was he playing? Who held thestakes? And how did the players stand on either side? Lupin couldnot tell. Knowing nothing, he flung himself headlong into the thickof the fray, between adversaries desperately involved, though hehimself was in total ignorance of their positions, their weapons,their resources and their secret plans. For, when all was said, hecould not admit that the object of all those efforts was to obtainpossession of a crystal stopper!One thing alone pleased him: Daubrecq had not penetrated hisdisguise. Daubrecq believed him to be in the employ of the police.Neither Daubrecq nor the police, therefore, suspected the intrusionof a third thief in the business. This was his one and only trump,a trump that gave him a liberty of action to which he attached thegreatest importance.Without further delay, he opened the letter which Daubrecq hadhanded him for the secretary-general of police. It contained thesefew lines:    “Within reach of your hand, my dear Prasville, within reach of    your hand! You touched it! A little more and the trick was    done.... But you’re too big a fool. And to think that they    couldn’t hit upon any one better than you to make me bite the    dust. Poor old France! Good-bye, Prasville. But, if I catch you    in the act, it will be a bad lookout for you: my maxim is to    shoot at sight.  “DAUBRECQ”“‘Within reach of your hand,’” repeated Lupin, after reading thenote. “And to think that the rogue may be writing the truth! Themost elementary hiding-places are the safest. We must look intothis, all the same. And, also, we must find out why Daubrecq isthe object of such strict supervision and obtain a few particularsabout the fellow generally.”       *       *       *       *       *The information supplied to Lupin by a private inquiry-officeconsisted of the following details:    “ALEXIS DAUBRECQ, deputy of the Bouches-du-Rhône for the past    two years; sits among the independent members. Political    opinions not very clearly defined, but electoral position    exceedingly strong, because of the enormous sums which he    spends in nursing his constituency. No private income.    Nevertheless, has a house in Paris, a villa at Enghien and    another at Nice and loses heavily at play, though no one    knows where the money comes from. Has great influence and    obtains all he wants without making up to ministers or,    apparently, having either friends or connections in political    circles.”“That’s a trade docket,” said Lupin to himself. “What I want isa domestic docket, a police docket, which will tell me about thegentleman’s private life and enable me to work more easily in thisdarkness and to know if I’m not getting myself into a tangle bybothering about the Daubrecq bird. And time’s getting short, hangit!”One of the residences which Lupin occupied at that period andwhich he used oftener than any of the others was in the RueChateaubriand, near the Arc de l’Étoile. He was known there by thename of Michel Beaumont. He had a snug flat here and was lookedafter by a man-servant, Achille, who was utterly devoted to hisinterests and whose chief duty was to receive and repeat thetelephone-messages addressed to Lupin by his followers.Lupin, on returning home, learnt, with great astonishment, that awoman had been waiting to see him for over an hour:“What! Why, no one ever comes to see me here! Is she young?”“No.... I don’t think so.”“You don’t think so!”“She’s wearing a lace shawl over her head, instead of a hat, andyou can’t see her face.... She’s more like a clerk . . . or a womanemployed in a shop. She’s not well-dressed....”“Whom did she ask for?”“M. Michel Beaumont,” replied the servant.“Queer. And why has she called?”“All she said was that it was about the Enghien business.... So Ithought that....”“What! The Enghien business! Then she knows that I am mixed up inthat business.... She knows that, by applying here....”“I could not get anything out of her, but I thought, all the same,that I had better let her in.”“Quite right. Where is she?”“In the drawing-room. I’ve put on the lights.”Lupin walked briskly across the hall and opened the door of thedrawing-room:“What are you talking about?” he said, to his man. “There’s no onehere.”“No one here?” said Achille, running up.And the room, in fact, was empty.“Well, on my word, this takes the cake!” cried the servant. “Itwasn’t twenty minutes ago that I came and had a look, to make sure.She was sitting over there. And there’s nothing wrong with myeyesight, you know.”“Look here, look here,” said Lupin, irritably. “Where were youwhile the woman was waiting?”“In the hall, governor! I never left the hall for a second! Ishould have seen her go out, blow it!”“Still, she’s not here now....”“So I see,” moaned the man, quite flabbergasted.“She must have got tired of waiting and gone away. But, dash itall, I should like to know how she got out!”“How she got out?” said Lupin. “It doesn’t take a wizard to tellthat.”“What do you mean?”“She got out through the window. Look, it’s still ajar. We are onthe ground-floor.... The street is almost always deserted, in theevenings. There’s no doubt about it.”He had looked around him and satisfied himself that nothing hadbeen taken away or moved. The room, for that matter, containedno knick-knack of any value, no important paper that might haveexplained the woman’s visit, followed by her sudden disappearance.And yet why that inexplicable flight?“Has any one telephoned?” he asked.“No.”“Any letters?”“Yes, one letter by the last post.”“Where is it?”“I put it on your mantel-piece, governor, as usual.”Lupin’s bedroom was next to the drawing-room, but Lupin hadpermanently bolted the door between the two. He, therefore, had togo through the hall again.Lupin switched on the electric light and, the next moment, said:“I don’t see it....”“Yes.... I put it next to the flower-bowl.”“There’s nothing here at all.”“You must be looking in the wrong place, governor.”But Achille moved the bowl, lifted the clock, bent down to thegrate, in vain: the letter was not there.“Oh blast it, blast it!” he muttered. “She’s done it . . . she’staken it.... And then, when she had the letter, she cleared out....Oh, the slut!...”Lupin said:“You’re mad! There’s no way through between the two rooms.”“Then who did take it, governor?”They were both of them silent. Lupin strove to control his angerand collect his ideas. He asked:“Did you look at the envelope?”“Yes.”“Anything particular about it?”“Yes, it looked as if it had been written in a hurry, or scribbled,rather.”“How was the address worded?... Do you remember?” asked Lupin, in avoice strained with anxiety.“Yes, I remembered it, because it struck me as funny....”“But speak, will you? Speak!”“It said, ‘_Monsieur de Beaumont, Michel_.’”[Illustration: Lupin took his servant by the shoulders and shookhim: “It said ‘de’ Beaumont? Are you sure?”]Lupin took his servant by the shoulders and shook him:“It said ‘de’ Beaumont? Are you sure? And ‘Michel’ after ‘Beaumont’?”“Quite certain.”“Ah!” muttered Lupin, with a choking throat. “It was a letter fromGilbert!”He stood motionless, a little pale, with drawn features. There wasno doubt about it: the letter was from Gilbert. It was the form ofaddress which, by Lupin’s orders, Gilbert had used for years incorresponding with him. Gilbert had at last--after long waiting andby dint of endless artifices--found a means of getting a letterposted from his prison and had hastily written to him. And now theletter was intercepted! What did it say? What instructions hadthe unhappy prisoner given? What help was he praying for? Whatstratagem did he suggest?Lupin looked round the room, which, contrary to the drawing-room,contained important papers. But none of the locks had been forced;and he was compelled to admit that the woman had no other objectthan to get hold of Gilbert’s letter.Constraining himself to keep his temper, he asked:“Did the letter come while the woman was here?”“At the same time. The porter rang at the same moment.”“Could she see the envelope?”“Yes.”The conclusion was evident. It remained to discover how the visitorhad been able to effect her theft. By slipping from one window tothe other, outside the flat? Impossible: Lupin found the window ofhis room shut. By opening the communicating door? Impossible: Lupinfound it locked and barred with its two inner bolts.Nevertheless, a person cannot pass through a wall by a mereoperation of will. To go in or out of a room requires a passage;and, as the act was accomplished in the space of a few minutes, itwas necessary, in the circumstances, that the passage should bepreviously in existence, that it should already have been contrivedin the wall and, of course, known to the woman. This hypothesissimplified the search by concentrating it upon the door; for thewall was quite bare, without a cupboard, chimney-piece or hangingsof any kind, and unable to conceal the least outlet.Lupin went back to the drawing-room and prepared to make a studyof the door. But he at once gave a start. He perceived, at thefirst glance, that the left lower panel of the six small panelscontained within the cross-bars of the door no longer occupied itsnormal position and that the light did not fall straight upon it.On leaning forward, he saw two little tin tacks sticking out oneither side and holding the panel in place, similar to a woodenboard behind a picture-frame. He had only to shift these. The panelat once came out.Achille gave a cry of amazement. But Lupin objected:“Well? And what then? We are no better off than before. Here is anempty oblong, eight or nine inches wide by sixteen inches high.You’re not going to pretend that a woman can slip through anopening which would not admit the thinnest child of ten years old!”“No, but she can have put her arm through and drawn the bolts.”“The bottom bolt, yes,” said Lupin. “But the top bolt, no: thedistance is far too great. Try for yourself and see.”Achille tried and had to give up the attempt.Lupin did not reply. He stood thinking for a long time. Then,suddenly, he said:“Give me my hat . . . my coat....”He hurried off, urged by an imperative idea. And, the moment hereached the street, he sprang into a taxi:“Rue Matignon, quick!...”As soon as they came to the house where he had been robbed of thecrystal stopper, he jumped out of the cab, opened his privateentrance, went upstairs, ran to the drawing-room, turned on thelight and crouched at the foot of the door leading to his bedroom.He had guessed right. One of the little panels was loosened in thesame manner.And, just as in his other flat in the Rue Chateaubriand, theopening was large enough to admit a man’s arm and shoulder, but notto allow him to draw the upper bolt.“Hang!” he shouted, unable any longer to master the rage that hadbeen seething within him for the last two hours. “Blast! Shall Inever have finished with this confounded business?”In fact, an incredible ill-luck seemed to dog his footsteps,compelling him to grope about at random, without permitting himto use the elements of success which his own persistency or thevery force of things placed within his grasp. Gilbert gave himthe crystal stopper. Gilbert sent him a letter. And both haddisappeared at that very moment.And it was not, as he had until then believed, a series offortuitous and independent circumstances. No, it was manifestlythe effect of an adverse will pursuing a definite object withprodigious ability and incredible boldness, attacking him, Lupin,in the recesses of his safest retreats and baffling him with blowsso severe and so unexpected that he did not even know against whomhe had to defend himself. Never, in the course of his adventures,had he encountered such obstacles as now.And, little by little, deep down within himself, there grew ahaunting dread of the future. A date loomed before his eyes, theterrible date which he unconsciously assigned to the law to performits work of vengeance, the date upon which, in the light of a wanApril morning, two men would mount the scaffold, two men who hadstood by him, two comrades whom he had been unable to save frompaying the awful penalty....[A] See 813, by Maurice Leblanc, translated by Alexander Teixeirade Mattos.']"
83,5,Chapter 5,"['III.THE HOME LIFE OF ALEXIS DAUBRECQWhen Daubrecq the deputy came in from lunch on the day after thepolice had searched his house he was stopped by Clémence, hisportress, who told him that she had found a cook who could bethoroughly relied on.The cook arrived a few minutes later and produced first-ratecharacters, signed by people with whom it was easy to take up herreferences. She was a very active woman, although of a certain age,and agreed to do the work of the house by herself, without thehelp of a man-servant, this being a condition upon which Daubrecqinsisted.Her last place was with a member of the Chamber of Deputies, ComteSaulevat, to whom Daubrecq at once telephoned. The count’s stewardgave her a perfect character, and she was engaged.As soon as she had fetched her trunk, she set to work and cleanedand scrubbed until it was time to cook the dinner.Daubrecq dined and went out.At eleven o’clock, after the portress had gone to bed, the cookcautiously opened the garden-gate. A man came up.“Is that you?” she asked.“Yes, it’s I, Lupin.”She took him to her bedroom on the third floor, overlooking thegarden, and at once burst into lamentations:“More of your tricks and nothing but tricks! Why can’t you leave mealone, instead of sending me to do your dirty work?”“How can I help it, you dear old Victoire?[B] When I want a personof respectable appearance and incorruptible morals, I think of you.You ought to be flattered.”“That’s all you care about me!” she cried. “You run me into dangeronce more; and you think it’s funny!”“What are you risking?”“How do you mean, what am I risking? All my characters are false.”“Characters are always false.”“And suppose M. Daubrecq finds out? Suppose he makes inquiries?”“He has made inquiries.”“Eh? What’s that?”“He has telephoned to the steward of Comte Saulevat, in whoseservice you say that you have had the honour of being.”“There, you see, I’m done for!”“The count’s steward could not say enough in your praise.”“He does not know me.”“But I know him. I got him his situation with Comte Saulevat. Soyou understand....”Victoire seemed to calm down a little:“Well,” she said, “God’s will be done . . . or rather yours. Andwhat do you expect me to do in all this?”“First, to put me up. You were my wet-nurse once. You can very wellgive me half your room now. I’ll sleep in the armchair.”“And next?”“Next? To supply me with such food as I want.”“And next?”“Next? To undertake, with me and under my direction, a regularseries of searches with a view....”“To what?”“To discovering the precious object of which I spoke to you.”“What’s that?”“A crystal stopper.”“A crystal stopper.... Saints above! A nice business! And, if wedon’t find your confounded stopper, what then?”Lupin took her gently by the arm and, in a serious voice:“If we don’t find it, Gilbert, young Gilbert whom you know andlove, will stand every chance of losing his head; and so willVaucheray.”“Vaucheray I don’t mind . . . a dirty rascal like him! ButGilbert....”“Have you seen the papers this evening? Things are looking worsethan ever. Vaucheray, as might be expected, accuses Gilbertof stabbing the valet; and it so happens that the knife whichVaucheray used belonged to Gilbert. That came out this morning.Whereupon Gilbert, who is intelligent in his way, but easilyfrightened, blithered and launched forth into stories and lieswhich will end in his undoing. That’s how the matter stands. Willyou help me?”       *       *       *       *       *The deputy came home at midnight.Thenceforth, for several days, Lupin moulded his existence uponDaubrecq’s, beginning his investigations the moment the deputyleft the house. He pursued them methodically, dividing each roominto sections which he did not abandon until he had been throughthe tiniest nooks and corners and, so to speak, exhausted everypossible device.Victoire searched also. And nothing was forgotten. Table-legs,chair-rungs, floor-boards, mouldings, mirror- and picture-frames,clocks, plinths, curtain-borders, telephone-holders and electricfittings: everything that an ingenious imagination could haveselected as a hiding-place was overhauled.And they also watched the deputy’s least actions, his mostunconscious movements, the expression of his face, the books whichhe read and the letters which he wrote.It was easy enough. He seemed to live his life in the light of day.No door was ever shut. He received no visits. And his existenceworked with mechanical regularity. He went to the Chamber in theafternoon, to the club in the evening.“Still,” said Lupin, “there must be something that’s not orthodoxbehind all this.”“There’s nothing of the sort,” moaned Victoire. “You’re wastingyour time and we shall be bowled out.”The presence of the detectives and their habit of walking up anddown outside the windows drove her mad. She refused to admit thatthey were there for any other purpose than to trap her, Victoire.And, each time that she went shopping, she was quite surprised thatone of those men did not lay his hand upon her shoulder.One day she returned all upset. Her basket of provisions wasshaking on her arm.“What’s the matter, my dear Victoire?” said Lupin. “You’re lookinggreen.”“Green? I dare say I do. So would you look green....”She had to sit down and it was only after making repeated effortsthat she succeeded in stuttering:“A man . . . a man spoke to me . . . at the fruiterer’s.”“By jingo! Did he want you to run away with him?”“No, he gave me a letter....”“Then what are you complaining about? It was a love-letter, ofcourse!”“No. ‘It’s for your governor,’ said he. ‘My governor?’ I said.‘Yes,’ he said, ‘for the gentleman who’s staying in your room.’”“What’s that?”This time, Lupin had started:“Give it here,” he said, snatching the letter from her. Theenvelope bore no address. But there was another, inside it, onwhich he read:  “_Monsieur Arsène Lupin_,  “_℅ Victoire._”“The devil!” he said. “This is a bit thick!” He tore open thesecond envelope. It contained a sheet of paper with the followingwords, written in large capitals:    “Everything you are doing is useless and dangerous.... Give    it up.”Victoire uttered one moan and fainted. As for Lupin, he felthimself blush up to his eyes, as though he had been grosslyinsulted. He experienced all the humiliation which a duellist wouldundergo if he heard the most secret advice which he had receivedfrom his seconds repeated aloud by a mocking adversary.However, he held his tongue. Victoire went back to her work. As forhim, he remained in his room all day, thinking.That night he did not sleep.And he kept saying to himself:“What is the good of thinking? I am up against one of thoseproblems which are not solved by any amount of thought. It iscertain that I am not alone in the matter and that, betweenDaubrecq and the police, there is, in addition to the third thiefthat I am, a fourth thief who is working on his own account, whoknows me and who reads my game clearly. But who is this fourththief? And am I mistaken, by any chance? And . . . oh, rot!...Let’s get to sleep!...”But he could not sleep; and a good part of the night went in thisway.At four o’clock in the morning he seemed to hear a noise in thehouse. He jumped up quickly and, from the top of the staircase, sawDaubrecq go down the first flight and turn toward the garden.A minute later, after opening the gate, the deputy returned with aman whose head was buried in an enormous fur collar and showed himinto his study.Lupin had taken his precautions in view of any such contingency. Asthe windows of the study and those of his bedroom, both of whichwere at the back of the house, overlooked the garden, he fastened arope-ladder to his balcony, unrolled it softly and let himself downby it until it was level with the top of the study windows.These windows were closed by shutters; but, as they were bowed,there remained a semi-circular space at the top; and Lupin, thoughhe could not hear, was able to see all that went on inside.He then realized that the person whom he had taken for a man wasa woman: a woman who was still young, though her dark hair wasmingled with gray; a tall woman, elegantly but quite unobtrusivelydressed, whose handsome features bore the expression of wearinessand melancholy which long suffering gives.“Where the deuce have I seen her before?” Lupin asked himself. “ForI certainly know that face, that look, that expression.”She stood leaning against the table, listening impassively toDaubrecq, who was also standing and who was talking very excitedly.He had his back turned to Lupin; but Lupin, leaning forward, caughtsight of a glass in which the deputy’s image was reflected. And hewas startled to see the strange look in his eyes, the air of fierceand brutal desire with which Daubrecq was staring at his visitor.It seemed to embarrass her too, for she sat down with lowered lids.Then Daubrecq leant over her and it appeared as though he wereready to fling his long arms, with their huge hands, around her.And, suddenly, Lupin perceived great tears rolling down the woman’ssad face.Whether or not it was the sight of those tears that made Daubrecqlose his head, with a brusque movement he clutched the woman anddrew her to him. She repelled him, with a violence full of hatred.And, after a brief struggle, during which Lupin caught a glimpseof the man’s bestial and contorted features, the two of them stoodface to face, railing at each other like mortal enemies.Then they stopped. Daubrecq sat down. There was mischief in hisface, and sarcasm as well. And he began to talk again, with sharptaps on the table, as though he were dictating terms.She no longer stirred. She sat haughtily in her chair and toweredover him, absent-minded, with roaming eyes. Lupin, captivatedby that powerful and sorrowful countenance, continued to watchher; and he was vainly seeking to remember of what or of whom shereminded him, when he noticed that she had turned her head slightlyand that she was imperceptibly moving her arm.And her arm strayed farther and farther and her hand crept alongthe table and Lupin saw that, at the end of the table, there stooda water-bottle with a gold-topped stopper. The hand reached thewater-bottle, felt it, rose gently and seized the stopper. A quickmovement of the head, a glance, and the stopper was put back in itsplace. Obviously, it was not what the woman hoped to find.“Dash it!” said Lupin. “She’s after the crystal stopper too! Thematter is becoming more complicated daily; there’s no doubt aboutit.”But, on renewing his observation of the visitor, he was astoundedto note the sudden and unexpected expression of her countenance,a terrible, implacable, ferocious expression. And he saw that herhand was continuing its stealthy progress round the table and that,with an uninterrupted and crafty sliding movement, it was pushingback books and, slowly and surely, approaching a dagger whose bladegleamed among the scattered papers.It gripped the handle.Daubrecq went on talking. Behind his back, the hand rose steadily,little by little; and Lupin saw the woman’s desperate and furiouseyes fixed upon the spot in the neck where she intended to plantthe knife:“You’re doing a very silly thing, fair lady,” thought Lupin.And he already began to turn over in his mind the best means ofescaping and of taking Victoire with him.She hesitated, however, with uplifted arm. But it was only amomentary weakness. She clenched her teeth. Her whole face,contracted with hatred, became yet further convulsed. And she madethe dread movement.At the same instant Daubrecq crouched and, springing from his seat,turned and seized the woman’s frail wrist in mid-air.Oddly enough, he addressed no reproach to her, as though the deedwhich she had attempted surprised him no more than any ordinary,very natural and simple act. He shrugged his shoulders, like aman accustomed to that sort of danger, and strode up and down insilence.She had dropped the weapon and was now crying, holding her headbetween her hands, with sobs that shook her whole frame.He next came up to her and said a few words, once more tapping thetable as he spoke.She made a sign in the negative and, when he insisted, she, in herturn, stamped her foot on the floor and exclaimed, loud enough forLupin to hear:“Never!... Never!...”Thereupon, without another word, Daubrecq fetched the fur cloakwhich she had brought with her and hung it over the woman’sshoulders, while she shrouded her face in a lace wrap.And he showed her out.Two minutes later, the garden-gate was locked again. “Pity I can’trun after that strange person,” thought Lupin, “and have a chatwith her about the Daubrecq bird. Seems to me that we two could doa good stroke of business together.”In any case, there was one point to be cleared up: Daubrecq thedeputy, whose life was so orderly, so apparently respectable, wasin the habit of receiving visits at night, when his house was nolonger watched by the police.He sent Victoire to arrange with two members of his gang to keepwatch for several days. And he himself remained awake next night.As on the previous morning, he heard a noise at four o’clock. As onthe previous morning, the deputy let some one in.Lupin ran down his ladder and, when he came to the free space abovethe shutters, saw a man crawling at Daubrecq’s feet, flinginghis arms round Daubrecq’s knees in frenzied despair and weeping,weeping convulsively.Daubrecq, laughing, pushed him away repeatedly, but the man clungto him. He behaved almost like one out of his mind and, at last, ina genuine fit of madness, half rose to his feet, took the deputyby the throat and flung him back in a chair. Daubrecq struggled,powerless at first, while his veins swelled in his temples. Butsoon, with a strength far beyond the ordinary, he regained themastery and deprived his adversary of all power of movement. Then,holding him with one hand, with the other he gave him two greatsmacks in the face.The man got up, slowly. He was livid and could hardly standon his legs. He waited for a moment, as though to recover hisself-possession. Then, with a terrifying calmness, he drew arevolver from his pocket and levelled it at Daubrecq.Daubrecq did not flinch. He even smiled, with a defiant air andwithout displaying more excitement than if he had been aimed atwith a toy pistol.The man stood for perhaps fifteen or twenty seconds, facing hisenemy, with outstretched arm. Then, with the same deliberateslowness, revealing a self-control which was all the moreimpressive because it followed upon a fit of extreme excitement,he put up his revolver and, from another pocket, produced hisnote-case.Daubrecq took a step forward.The man opened the pocketbook. A sheaf of bank-notes appeared insight.Daubrecq seized and counted them. They were thousand-franc notes,and there were thirty of them.The man looked on, without a movement of revolt, without aprotest. He obviously understood the futility of words. Daubrecqwas one of those who do not relent. Why should his visitor wastetime in beseeching him or even in revenging himself upon him byuttering vain threats and insults? He had no hope of striking thatunassailable enemy. Even Daubrecq’s death would not deliver himfrom Daubrecq.He took his hat and went away.At eleven o’clock in the morning Victoire, on returning from hershopping, handed Lupin a note from his accomplices.He opened it and read:    “The man who came to see Daubrecq last night is Langeroux the    deputy, leader of the independent left. A poor man, with a    large family.”“Come,” said Lupin, “Daubrecq is nothing more nor less than ablackmailer; but, by Jupiter, he has jolly effective ways of goingto work!”Events tended to confirm Lupin’s supposition. Three days later hesaw another visitor hand Daubrecq an important sum of money. And,two days after that, one came and left a pearl necklace behind him.The first was called Dachaumont, a senator and ex-cabinet-minister.The second was the Marquis d’Albufex, a Bonapartist deputy,formerly chief political agent in France of Prince Napoleon.The scene, in each of these cases, was very similar to Langerouxthe deputy’s interview, a violent tragic scene, ending inDaubrecq’s victory.“And so on and so forth,” thought Lupin, when he received theseparticulars. “I have been present at four visits. I shall know nomore if there are ten, or twenty, or thirty.... It is enough forme to learn the names of the visitors from my friends on sentry-gooutside. Shall I go and call on them?... What for? They have noreason to confide in me.... On the other hand, am I to stay onhere, delayed by investigations which lead to nothing and whichVictoire can continue just as well without me?”He was very much perplexed. The news of the inquiry into thecase of Gilbert and Vaucheray was becoming worse and worse, thedays were slipping by, and not an hour passed without his askinghimself, in anguish, whether all his efforts--granting that hesucceeded--would not end in farcical results, absolutely foreign tothe aim which he was pursuing.For, after all, supposing that he did fathom Daubrecq’s underhanddealings, would that give him the means of rescuing Gilbert andVaucheray?That day an incident occurred which put an end to his indecision.After lunch Victoire heard snatches of a conversation whichDaubrecq held with some one on the telephone. Lupin gathered, fromwhat Victoire reported, that the deputy had an appointment with alady for half-past eight and that he was going to take her to atheatre:“I shall get a pit-tier box, like the one we had six weeks ago,”Daubrecq had said. And he added, with a laugh, “I hope that I shallnot have the burglars in during that time.”There was not a doubt in Lupin’s mind. Daubrecq was about to spendhis evening in the same manner in which he had spent the eveningsix weeks ago, while they were breaking into his villa at Enghien.To know the person whom he was to meet and perhaps thus to discoverhow Gilbert and Vaucheray had learnt that Daubrecq would be awayfrom eight o’clock in the evening until one o’clock in the morning:these were matters of the utmost importance.Lupin left the house in the afternoon, with Victoire’s assistance.He knew through her that Daubrecq was coming home for dinnerearlier than usual.He went to his flat in the Rue Chateaubriand, telephoned for threeof his friends, dressed and made himself up in his favouritecharacter of a Russian prince, with fair hair and moustache andshort-cut whiskers.The accomplices arrived in a motor-car.At that moment, Achille, his man, brought him a telegram, addressedto M. Michel Beaumont, Rue Chateaubriand, which ran:    “Do not come to theatre this evening. Danger of your intervention    spoiling everything.”There was a flower-vase on the chimney-piece beside him. Lupin tookit and smashed it to pieces.“That’s it, that’s it,” he snarled. “They are playing with me as Iusually play with others. Same behaviour. Same tricks. Only there’sthis difference....”What difference? He hardly knew. The truth was that he too wasbaffled and disconcerted to the inmost recesses of his being andthat he was continuing to act only from obstinacy, from a sense ofduty, so to speak, and without putting his ordinary good humour andhigh spirits into the work.“Come along,” he said to his accomplices.By his instructions, the chauffeur set them down near the SquareLamartine, but kept the motor going. Lupin foresaw that Daubrecq,in order to escape the detectives watching the house, would jumpinto the first taxi; and he did not intend to be outdistanced.He had not allowed for Daubrecq’s cleverness.At half-past seven both leaves of the garden-gate were flung open,a bright light flashed and a motor-cycle darted across the road,skirted the square, turned in front of the motor-car and shot awaytoward the Bois at a speed so great that they would have been madto go in pursuit of it.“Good-bye, Daisy!” said Lupin, trying to jest, but really overcomewith rage.He eyed his accomplices in the hope that one of them would ventureto give a mocking smile. How pleased he would have been to vent hisnerves on them!“Let’s go home,” he said to his companions.He gave them some dinner; then he smoked a cigar and they set offagain in the car and went the round of the theatres, beginningwith those which were giving light operas and musical comedies,for which he presumed that Daubrecq and his lady would have apreference. He took a stall, inspected the lower-tier boxes andwent away again.He next drove to the more serious theatres: the Renaissance, theGymnase.At last, at ten o’clock in the evening, he saw a pit-tier box atthe Vaudeville almost entirely protected from inspection by its twoscreens; and, on tipping the boxkeeper, was told that it containeda short, stout, elderly gentleman and a lady who was wearing athick lace veil.The next box was free. He took it, went back to his friends to givethem their instructions and sat down near the couple.During the entr’acte, when the lights went up, he perceivedDaubrecq’s profile. The lady remained at the back of the box,invisible. The two were speaking in a low voice; and, when thecurtain rose again, they went on speaking, but in such a way thatLupin could not distinguish a word.Ten minutes passed. Some one tapped at their door. It was one ofthe men from the box-office.“Are you M. le Député Daubrecq, sir?” he asked.“Yes,” said Daubrecq, in a voice of surprise. “But how do you knowmy name?”“There’s a gentleman asking for you on the telephone. He told me togo to Box 22.”“But who is it?”“M. le Marquis d’Albufex.”“Eh?”“What am I to say, sir?”“I’m coming.... I’m coming....”Daubrecq rose hurriedly from his seat and followed the clerk to thebox-office.He was not yet out of sight when Lupin sprang from his box, workedthe lock of the next door and sat down beside the lady.She gave a stifled cry.“Hush!” he said. “I have to speak to you. It is most important.”“Ah!” she said, between her teeth. “Arsène Lupin!” He wasdumbfounded. For a moment he sat quiet, open-mouthed. The womanknew him! And not only did she know him, but she had recognizedhim through his disguise! Accustomed though he was to the mostextraordinary and unusual events, this disconcerted him.He did not even dream of protesting and stammered:“So you know?... So you know?...”He snatched at the lady’s veil and pulled it aside before she hadtime to defend herself:“What!” he muttered, with increased amazement. “Is it possible?”It was the woman whom he had seen at Daubrecq’s a few days earlier,the woman who had raised her dagger against Daubrecq and who hadintended to stab him with all the strength of her hatred.It was her turn to be taken aback:“What! Have you seen me before?...”“Yes, the other night, at his house.... I saw what you tried todo....”She made a movement to escape. He held her back and, speaking withgreat eagerness:“I must know who you are,” he said. “That was why I had Daubrecqtelephoned for.”She looked aghast:“Do you mean to say it was not the Marquis d’Albufex?”“No, it was one of my assistants.”“Then Daubrecq will come back?...”“Yes, but we have time.... Listen to me.... We must meet again....He is your enemy.... I will save you from him....”“Why should you? What is your object?”“Do not distrust me . . . it is quite certain that our interestsare identical.... Where can I see you? To-morrow, surely? At whattime? And where?”“Well....”She looked at him with obvious hesitation, not knowing what to do,on the point of speaking and yet full of uneasiness and doubt.He pressed her:“Oh, I entreat you . . . answer me just one word . . . and atonce.... It would be a pity for him to find me here.... I entreatyou....”She answered sharply:“My name doesn’t matter.... We will see each other first and youshall explain to me.... Yes, we will meet.... Listen, to-morrow, atthree o’clock, at the corner of the Boulevard....”At that exact moment, the door of the box opened, so to speak, witha bang, and Daubrecq appeared.“Rats!” Lupin mumbled, under his breath, furious at being caughtbefore obtaining what he wanted.Daubrecq gave a chuckle:“So that’s it.... I thought something was up.... Ah, thetelephone-trick: a little out of date, sir! I had not gone half-waywhen I turned back.”He pushed Lupin to the front of the box and, sitting down besidethe lady, said:“And, now my lord, who are we? A servant at the police-office,probably? There’s a professional look about that mug of yours.”He stared hard at Lupin, who did not move a muscle, and tried toput a name to the face, but failed to recognize the man whom he hadcalled Polonius.Lupin, without taking his eyes from Daubrecq either, reflected.He would not for anything in the world have thrown up the game atthat point or neglected this favourable opportunity of coming to anunderstanding with his mortal enemy.The woman sat in her corner, motionless, and watched them both.Lupin said:“Let us go outside, sir. That will make our interview easier.”“No, my lord, here,” grinned the deputy. “It will take place here,presently, during the entr’acte. Then we shall not be disturbinganybody.”“But....”“Save your breath, my man; you sha’n’t budge.”And he took Lupin by the coat-collar, with the obvious intention ofnot letting go of him before the interval.A rash move! Was it likely that Lupin would consent to remain insuch an attitude, especially before a woman, a woman to whom he hadoffered his alliance, a woman--and he now thought of it for thefirst time--who was distinctly good-looking and whose grave beautyattracted him. His whole pride as a man rose at the thought.However, he said nothing. He accepted the heavy weight of thehand on his shoulder and even sat bent in two, as though beaten,powerless, almost frightened.“Eh, clever!” said the deputy, scoffingly. “We don’t seem to beswaggering quite so much.”The stage was full of actors who were arguing and making a noise.Daubrecq had loosened his grasp slightly and Lupin felt that themoment had come. With the edge of his hand, he gave him a violentblow in the hollow of the arm, as he might have done with a hatchet.The pain took Daubrecq off his guard. Lupin now released himselfentirely and sprang at the other to clutch him by the throat. ButDaubrecq had at once put himself on the defensive and stepped backand their four hands seized one another.They gripped with superhuman energy, the whole force of the twoadversaries concentrating in those hands. Daubrecq’s were ofmonstrous size; and Lupin, caught in that iron vise, felt as thoughhe were fighting not with a man, but with some terrible beast, ahuge gorilla.They held each other against the door, bending low, like a pair ofwrestlers groping and trying to lay hold of each other. Their bonescreaked. Whichever gave way first was bound to be caught by thethroat and strangled. And all this happened amid a sudden silence,for the actors on the stage were now listening to one of theirnumber, who was speaking in a low voice.The woman stood back flat against the partition, looking at themin terror. Had she taken sides with either of them, with a singlemovement, the victory would at once have been decided in that one’sfavour. But which of them should she assist? What could Lupinrepresent in her eyes? A friend? An enemy?She briskly made for the front of the box, forced back the screenand, leaning forward, seemed to give a signal. Then she returnedand tried to slip to the door.Lupin, as though wishing to help her, said:“Why don’t you move the chair?”He was speaking of a heavy chair which had fallen down between himand Daubrecq and across which they were struggling.The woman stooped and pulled away the chair. That was what Lupinwas waiting for. Once rid of the obstacle, he caught Daubrecq asmart kick on the shin with the tip of his patent-leather boot.The result was the same as with the blow which he had given him onthe arm. The pain caused a second’s apprehension and distraction,of which he at once took advantage to beat down Daubrecq’soutstretched hands and to dig his ten fingers into his adversary’sthroat and neck.Daubrecq struggled. Daubrecq tried to pull away the hands that werethrottling him; but he was beginning to choke and felt his strengthdecreasing.“Aha, you old monkey!” growled Lupin, forcing him to the floor.“Why don’t you shout for help? How frightened you must be of ascandal!”At the sound of the fall there came a knocking at the partition, onthe other side.“Knock away, knock away,” said Lupin, under his breath. “The playis on the stage. This is my business and, until I’ve mastered thisgorilla....”It did not take him long. The deputy was choking. Lupin stunned himwith a blow on the jaw; and all that remained for him to do was totake the woman away and make his escape with her before the alarmwas given.But, when he turned round, he saw that the woman was gone.She could not be far. Darting from the box, he set off at a run,regardless of the programme-sellers and check-takers.On reaching the entrance-lobby, he saw her through an open door,crossing the pavement of the Chaussée d’Antin.She was stepping into a motor-car when he came up with her.The door closed behind her.He seized the handle and tried to pull at it.But a man jumped up inside and sent his fist flying into Lupin’sface, with less skill but no less force than Lupin had sent hisinto Daubrecq’s face.Stunned though he was by the blow, he nevertheless had ample timeto recognize the man, in a sudden, startled vision, and also torecognize, under his chauffeur’s disguise, the man who was drivingthe car. It was the Growler and the Masher, the two men in chargeof the boats on the Enghien night, two friends of Gilbert andVaucheray: in short, two of Lupin’s own accomplices.       *       *       *       *       *When he reached his rooms in the Rue Chateaubriand, Lupin, afterwashing the blood from his face, sat for over an hour in a chair,as though overwhelmed. For the first time in his life he wasexperiencing the pain of treachery. For the first time his comradesin the fight were turning against their chief.Mechanically, to divert his thoughts, he turned to his correspondenceand tore the wrapper from an evening paper. Among the late news hefound the following paragraphs:  “THE VILLA MARIE-THERESE CASE”    “The real identity of Vaucheray, one of the alleged murderers    of Léonard the valet, has at last been ascertained. He is a    miscreant of the worst type, a hardened criminal who has    already twice been sentenced for murder, in default, under    another name.    “No doubt, the police will end by also discovering the    real name of his accomplice, Gilbert. In any event, the    examining-magistrate is determined to commit the prisoners    for trial as soon as possible.    “The public will have no reason to complain of the delays    of the law.”In between other newspapers and prospectuses lay a letter.Lupin jumped when he saw it. It was addressed:  “_Monsieur de Beaumont, Michel._”“Oh,” he gasped, “a letter from Gilbert!”It contained these few words:    “Help, governor!... I am frightened. I am frightened....”Once again, Lupin spent a night alternating between sleeplessnessand nightmares. Once again, he was tormented by atrocious andterrifying visions.[B] See _The Hollow Needle_ by Maurice Leblanc, translated byAlexander Teixeira de Mattos, and later volumes of the Lupin series.']"
83,6,Chapter 6,"['IV.THE CHIEF OF THE ENEMIES“Poor boy!” murmured Lupin, when his eyes fell on Gilbert’s letternext morning. “How he must feel it!”On the very first day when he saw him, he had taken a liking tothat well-set-up youngster, so careless, gay and fond of life.Gilbert was devoted to him, would have accepted death at a signfrom his master. And Lupin also loved his frankness, his goodhumour, his simplicity, his bright, open face.“Gilbert,” he often used to say, “you are an honest man. Do youknow, if I were you, I should chuck the business and become anhonest man for good.”“After you, governor,” Gilbert would reply, with a laugh.“Won’t you, though?”“No, governor. An honest man is a chap who works and grinds. It’s ataste which I may have had as a nipper; but they’ve made me lose itsince.”“Who’s they?”Gilbert was silent. He was always silent when questioned about hisearly life; and all that Lupin knew was that he had been an orphansince childhood and that he had lived all over the place, changinghis name and taking up the queerest jobs. The whole thing was amystery which no one had been able to fathom; and it did not lookas though the police would make much of it either.Nor, on the other hand, did it look as though the police wouldconsider that mystery a reason for delaying proceedings. They wouldsend Vaucheray’s accomplice for trial--under his name of Gilbert orany other name--and visit him with the same inevitable punishment.“Poor boy!” repeated Lupin. “They’re persecuting him like thisonly because of me. They are afraid of his escaping and theyare in a hurry to finish the business: the verdict first andthen . . . the execution.... Oh, the butchers!... A lad of twenty,who has committed no murder, who is not even an accomplice in themurder....”Alas, Lupin well knew that this was a thing impossible to prove andthat he must concentrate his efforts upon another point. But uponwhich? Was he to abandon the trail of the crystal stopper?He could not make up his mind to that. His one and only diversionfrom the search was to go to Enghien, where the Growler and theMasher lived, and make sure that nothing had been seen of themsince the murder at the Villa Marie-Thérèse. Apart from this, heapplied himself to the question of Daubrecq and nothing else.He refused even to trouble his head about the problems set beforehim: the treachery of the Growler and the Masher; their connectionwith the gray-haired lady; the spying of which he himself was theobject.“Steady, Lupin,” he said. “One only argues falsely in a fever.So hold your tongue. No inferences, above all things! Nothing ismore foolish than to infer one fact from another before findinga certain starting-point. That’s where you get up a tree. Listento your instinct. Act according to your instinct. And as you arepersuaded, outside all argument, outside all logic, one might say,that this business turns upon that confounded stopper, go for itboldly. Have at Daubrecq and his bit of crystal!”Lupin did not wait to arrive at these conclusions before settlinghis actions accordingly. At the moment when he was stating themin his mind, three days after the scene at the Vaudeville, he wassitting, dressed like a retired tradesman, in an old overcoat, witha muffler round his neck, on a bench in the Avenue Victor-Hugo,at some distance from the Square Lamartine. Victoire had hisinstructions to pass by that bench at the same hour every morning.“Yes,” he repeated to himself, “the crystal stopper: everythingturns on that.... Once I get hold of it....”Victoire arrived, with her shopping-basket on her arm. He at oncenoticed her extraordinary agitation and pallor:“What’s the matter?” asked Lupin, walking beside his old nurse.She went into a big grocer’s, which was crowded with people, and,turning to him:“Here,” she said, in a voice torn with excitement. “Here’s whatyou’ve been hunting for.”And, taking something from her basket, she gave it to him.Lupin stood astounded: in his hand lay the crystal stopper.“Can it be true? Can it be true?” he muttered, as though the easeof the solution had thrown him off his balance.But the fact remained, visible and palpable. He recognized by itsshape, by its size, by the worn gilding of its facets, recognizedbeyond any possible doubt the crystal stopper which he had seenbefore. He even remarked a tiny, hardly noticeable little scratchon the stem which he remembered perfectly.However, while the thing presented all the same characteristics,it possessed no other that seemed out of the way. It was a crystalstopper, that was all. There was no really special mark todistinguish it from other stoppers. There was no sign upon it, nostamp; and, being cut from a single piece, it contained no foreignobject.“What then?”And Lupin received a quick insight into the depth of his mistake.What good could the possession of that crystal stopper do him solong as he was ignorant of its value? That bit of glass had noexistence in itself; it counted only through the meaning thatattached to it. Before taking it, the thing was to be certain. Andhow could he tell that, in taking it, in robbing Daubrecq of it, hewas not committing an act of folly?It was a question which was impossible of solution, but whichforced itself upon him with singular directness.“No blunders!” he said to himself, as he pocketed the stopper. “Inthis confounded business, blunders are fatal.”He had not taken his eyes off Victoire. Accompanied by a shopman,she went from counter to counter, among the throng of customers.She next stood for some little while at the pay-desk and passed infront of Lupin.He whispered her instructions:“Meet me behind the Lycée Janson.”She joined him in an unfrequented street:“And suppose I’m followed?” she said.“No,” he declared. “I looked carefully. Listen to me. Where did youfind the stopper?”“In the drawer of the table by his bed.”“But we had felt there already.”“Yes; and I did so again this morning. I expect he put it therelast night.”“And I expect he’ll want to take it from there again,” said Lupin.“Very likely.”“And suppose he finds it gone?”Victoire looked frightened.“Answer me,” said Lupin. “If he finds it gone, he’ll accuse you oftaking it, won’t he?”“Certainly.”“Then go and put it back, as fast as you can.”“Oh dear, oh dear!” she moaned. “I hope he won’t have had time tofind out. Give it to me, quick.”“Here you are,” said Lupin.He felt in the pocket of his overcoat.“Well?” said Victoire, holding out her hand.“Well,” he said, after a moment, “it’s gone.”“What!”“Yes, upon my word, it’s gone . . . somebody’s taken it from me.”He burst into a peal of laughter, a laughter which, this time, wasfree from all bitterness.Victoire flew out at him:“Laugh away!... Putting me in such a predicament!...”“How can I help laughing? You must confess that it’s funny. It’sno longer a tragedy that we’re acting, but a fairy-tale, as much afairy-tale as _Puss in Boots_ or _Jack and the Beanstalk_. I mustwrite it when I get a few weeks to myself: _The Magic Stopper; or,The Mishaps of Poor Arsène._”“Well . . . who has taken it from you?”“What are you talking about?... It has flown away . . . vanishedfrom my pocket: hey presto, begone!”He gave the old servant a gentle push and, in a more serious tone:“Go home, Victoire, and don’t upset yourself. Of course, some onesaw you give me the stopper and took advantage of the crowd in theshop to pick my pocket of it. That only shows that we are watchedmore closely than I thought and by adversaries of the first rank.But, once more, be easy. Honest men always come by their own....Have you anything else to tell me?”“Yes. Some one came yesterday evening, while M. Daubrecq was out. Isaw lights reflected upon the trees in the garden.”“The portress’ bedroom?”“The portress was up.”“Then it was some of those detective-fellows; they are stillhunting. I’ll see you later, Victoire. You must let me in again.”“What! You want to....”“What do I risk? Your room is on the third floor. Daubrecq suspectsnothing.”“But the others!”“The others? If it was to their interest to play me a trick, they’dhave tried before now. I’m in their way, that’s all. They’re notafraid of me. So till later, Victoire, at five o’clock exactly.”One further surprise awaited Lupin. In the evening his old nursetold him that, having opened the drawer of the bedside table fromcuriosity, she had found the crystal stopper there again.Lupin was no longer to be excited by these miraculous incidents. Hesimply said to himself:“So it’s been brought back. And the person who brought it back andwho enters this house by some unexplained means considered, as Idid, that the stopper ought not to disappear. And yet Daubrecq,who knows that he is being spied upon to his very bedroom, hasonce more left the stopper in a drawer, as though he attached noimportance to it at all! Now what is one to make of that?”Though Lupin did not make anything of it, nevertheless he couldnot escape certain arguments, certain associations of ideas thatgave him the same vague foretaste of light which one receives onapproaching the outlet of a tunnel.“It is inevitable, as the case stands,” he thought, “that theremust soon be an encounter between myself and the others. From thatmoment I shall be master of the situation.”Five days passed, during which Lupin did not glean the slightestparticular. On the sixth day Daubrecq received a visit, in thesmall hours, from a gentleman, Laybach the deputy, who, like hiscolleagues, dragged himself at his feet in despair and, when allwas done, handed him twenty thousand francs.Two more days; and then, one night, posted on the landing of thesecond floor, Lupin heard the creaking of a door, the front-door,as he perceived, which led from the hall into the garden. In thedarkness he distinguished, or rather divined, the presence of twopersons, who climbed the stairs and stopped on the first floor,outside Daubrecq’s bedroom.What were they doing there? It was not possible to enter the room,because Daubrecq bolted his door every night. Then what were theyhoping?Manifestly, a handiwork of some kind was being performed, as Lupindiscovered from the dull sounds of rubbing against the door. Thenwords, uttered almost beneath a whisper, reached him:“Is it all right?”“Yes, quite, but, all the same, we’d better put it off tillto-morrow, because....”Lupin did not hear the end of the sentence. The men were alreadygroping their way downstairs. The hall-door was closed, verygently, and then the gate.“It’s curious, say what one likes,” thought Lupin. “Here is a housein which Daubrecq carefully conceals his rascalities and is onhis guard, not without good reason, against spies; and everybodywalks in and out as in a booth at a fair. Victoire lets me in,the portress admits the emissaries of the police: that’s well andgood; but who is playing false in these people’s favour? Are we tosuppose that they are acting alone? But what fearlessness! And howwell they know their way about!”In the afternoon, during Daubrecq’s absence, he examined thedoor of the first-floor bedroom. And, at the first glance, heunderstood: one of the lower panels had been skilfully cut out andwas only held in place by invisible tacks. The people, therefore,who had done this work were the same who had acted at his twoplaces, in the Rue Matignon and the Rue Chateaubriand.He also found that the work dated back to an earlier period andthat, as in his case, the opening had been prepared beforehand, inanticipation of favourable circumstances or of some immediate need.The day did not seem long to Lupin. Knowledge was at hand. Not onlywould he discover the manner in which his adversaries employedthose little openings, which were apparently unemployable, sincethey did not allow a person to reach the upper bolts, but he wouldlearn who the ingenious and energetic adversaries were with whom herepeatedly and inevitably found himself confronted.One incident annoyed him. In the evening Daubrecq, who hadcomplained of feeling tired at dinner, came home at ten o’clockand, contrary to his usual custom, pushed the bolts of thehall-door. In that case, how would the others be able to carryout their plan and go to Daubrecq’s room? Lupin waited for anhour after Daubrecq put out his light. Then he went down to thedeputy’s study, opened one of the windows ajar and returned to thethird floor and fixed his rope-ladder so that, in case of need, hecould reach the study without passing though the house. Lastly, heresumed his post on the second-floor landing.He did not have to wait long. An hour earlier than on the previousnight some one tried to open the hall-door. When the attemptfailed, a few minutes of absolute silence followed. And Lupinwas beginning to think that the men had abandoned the idea, whenhe gave a sudden start. Some one had passed, without the leastsound to interrupt the silence. He would not have known it, soutterly were the thing’s steps deadened by the stair-carpet, if thebaluster-rail, which he himself held in his hand, had not shakenslightly. Some one was coming upstairs.And, as the ascent continued, Lupin became aware of the uncannyfeeling that he heard nothing more than before. He knew, because ofthe rail, that a thing was coming and he could count the number ofsteps climbed by noting each vibration of the rail; but no otherindication gave him that dim sensation of presence which we feel indistinguishing movements which we do not see, in perceiving soundswhich we do not hear. And yet a blacker darkness ought to havetaken shape within the darkness and something ought, at least, tomodify the quality of the silence. No, he might well have believedthat there was no one there.And Lupin, in spite of himself and against the evidence of hisreason, ended by believing it, for the rail no longer moved and hethought that he might have been the sport of an illusion.And this lasted a long time. He hesitated, not knowing what to do,not knowing what to suppose. But an odd circumstance impressed him.A clock struck two. He recognized the chime of Daubrecq’s clock.And the chime was that of a clock from which one is not separatedby the obstacle of a door.Lupin slipped down the stairs and went to the door. It was closed,but there was a space on the left, at the bottom, a space left bythe removal of the little panel.He listened. Daubrecq, at that moment, turned in his bed; and hisbreathing was resumed, evenly and a little stertorously. And Lupinplainly heard the sound of rumpling garments. Beyond a doubt, thething was there, fumbling and feeling through the clothes whichDaubrecq had laid beside his bed.“Now,” thought Lupin, “we shall learn something. But how the deucedid the beggar get in? Has he managed to draw the bolts and openthe door? But, if so, why did he make the mistake of shutting itagain?”Not for a second--a curious anomaly in a man like Lupin, an anomalyto be explained only by the uncanny feeling which the wholeadventure produced in him--not for a second did he suspect the verysimple truth which was about to be revealed to him. Continuing hisway down, he crouched on one of the bottom steps of the staircase,thus placing himself between the door of the bedroom and thehall-door, on the road which Daubrecq’s enemy must inevitably takein order to join his accomplices.He questioned the darkness with an unspeakable anguish. He was onthe point of unmasking that enemy of Daubrecq’s, who was also hisown adversary. He would thwart his plans. And the booty capturedfrom Daubrecq he would capture in his turn, while Daubrecq sleptand while the accomplices lurking behind the hall-door or outsidethe garden-gate vainly awaited their leader’s return.And that return took place. Lupin knew it by the renewed vibrationof the balusters. And, once more, with every sense strained andevery nerve on edge, he strove to discern the mysterious thingthat was coming toward him. He suddenly realized it when only afew yards away. He himself, hidden in a still darker recess, couldnot be seen. And what he saw--in the very vaguest manner--wasapproaching stair by stair, with infinite precautions, holding onto each separate baluster.“Whom the devil have I to do with?” said Lupin to himself, whilehis heart thumped inside his chest.The catastrophe was hastened. A careless movement on Lupin’s partwas observed by the stranger, who stopped short. Lupin was afraidlest the other should turn back and take to flight. He sprang atthe adversary and was stupefied at encountering nothing but spaceand knocking against the stair-rail without seizing the form whichhe saw. But he at once rushed forward, crossed the best part of thehall and caught up his antagonist just as he was reaching the dooropening on the garden.There was a cry of fright, answered by other cries on the furtherside of the door.“Oh, hang it, what’s this?” muttered Lupin, whose arms had closed,in the dark, round a little, tiny, trembling, whimpering thing.Suddenly understanding, he stood for a moment motionless anddismayed, at a loss what to do with his conquered prey. But theothers were shouting and stamping outside the door. Thereupon,dreading lest Daubrecq should wake up, he slipped the little thingunder his jacket, against his chest, stopped the crying with hishandkerchief rolled into a ball and hurried up the three flights ofstairs.[Illustration: “Here, I’ve brought you the indomitable chief of ourenemies. Have you a feeding bottle?”]“Here,” he said to Victoire, who woke with a start. “I’ve broughtyou the indomitable chief of our enemies, the Hercules of the gang.Have you a feeding-bottle about you?”He put down in the easy-chair a child of six or seven years of age,the tiniest little fellow in a gray jersey and a knitted woollencap, whose pale and exquisitely pretty features were streaked withthe tears that streamed from the terrified eyes.“Where did you pick that up?” asked Victoire, aghast.“At the foot of the stairs, as it was coming out of Daubrecq’sbedroom,” replied Lupin, feeling the jersey in the hope that thechild had brought a booty of some kind from that room.Victoire was stirred to pity:“Poor little dear! Look, he’s trying not to cry!... Oh, saintsabove, his hands are like ice! Don’t be afraid, sonnie, we sha’n’thurt you: the gentleman’s all right.”“Yes,” said Lupin, “the gentleman’s quite all right, but there’sanother very wicked gentleman who’ll wake up if they go on makingsuch a rumpus outside the hall-door. Do you hear them, Victoire?”“Who is it?”“The satellites of our young Hercules, the indomitable leader’sgang.”“Well...?” stammered Victoire, utterly unnerved.“Well, as I don’t want to be caught in the trap, I shall start byclearing out. Are you coming, Hercules?”He rolled the child in a blanket, so that only its head remainedoutside, gagged its mouth as gently as possible and made Victoirefasten it to his shoulders:“See, Hercules? We’re having a game. You never thought you’d findgentlemen to play pick-a-back with you at three o’clock in themorning! Come, whoosh, let’s fly away! You don’t get giddy, I hope?”He stepped across the window-ledge and set foot on one of the rungsof the ladder. He was in the garden in a minute.He had never ceased hearing and now heard more plainly still theblows that were being struck upon the front-door. He was astoundedthat Daubrecq was not awakened by so violent a din:“If I don’t put a stop to this, they’ll spoil everything,” he saidto himself.He stood in an angle of the house, invisible in the darkness, andmeasured the distance between himself and the gate. The gate wasopen. To his right, he saw the steps, on the top of which thepeople were flinging themselves about; to his left, the buildingoccupied by the portress.The woman had come out of her lodge and was standing near thepeople, entreating them:“Oh, do be quiet, do be quiet! He’ll come!”“Capital!” said Lupin. “The good woman is an accomplice of these aswell. By Jingo, what a pluralist!”He rushed across to her and, taking her by the scruff of the neck,hissed:“Go and tell them I’ve got the child.... They can come and fetch itat my place, Rue Chateaubriand.”A little way off, in the avenue, stood a taxi which Lupin presumedto be engaged by the gang. Speaking authoritatively, as though hewere one of the accomplices, he stepped into the cab and told theman to drive him home.“Well,” he said to the child, “that wasn’t much of a shake-up, wasit?... What do you say to going to bye-bye on the gentleman’s bed?”As his servant, Achille, was asleep, Lupin made the little chapcomfortable and stroked his hair for him. The child seemed numbed.His poor face was as though petrified into a stiff expression madeup, at one and the same time, of fear and the wish not to showfear, of the longing to scream and a pitiful effort not to scream.“Cry, my pet, cry,” said Lupin. “It’ll do you good to cry.”The child did not cry, but the voice was so gentle and so kind thathe relaxed his tense muscles; and, now that his eyes were calmerand his mouth less contorted, Lupin, who was examining him closely,found something that he recognized, an undoubted resemblance.This again confirmed certain facts which he suspected and which hehad for some time been linking in his mind. Indeed, unless he wasmistaken, the position was becoming very different and he wouldsoon assume the direction of events. After that....A ring at the bell followed, at once, by two others, sharp ones.“Hullo!” said Lupin to the child. “Here’s mummy come to fetch you.Don’t move.”He ran and opened the door.A woman entered, wildly:“My son!” she screamed. “My son! Where is he?”“In my room,” said Lupin.Without asking more, thus proving that she knew the way, she rushedto the bedroom.“As I thought,” muttered Lupin. “The youngish woman with the grayhair: Daubrecq’s friend and enemy.”He walked to the window and looked through the curtains. Two menwere striding up and down the opposite pavement: the Growler andthe Masher.“And they’re not even hiding themselves,” he said to himself.“That’s a good sign. They consider that they can’t do without meany longer and that they’ve got to obey the governor. There remainsthe pretty lady with the gray hair. That will be more difficult.It’s you and I now, mummy.”He found the mother and the boy clasped in each other’s arms; andthe mother, in a great state of alarm, her eyes moist with tears,was saying:“You’re not hurt? You’re sure? Oh, how frightened you must havebeen, my poor little Jacques!”“A fine little fellow,” said Lupin.She did not reply. She was feeling the child’s jersey, as Lupin haddone, no doubt to see if he had succeeded in his nocturnal mission;and she questioned him in a whisper.“No, mummy,” said the child. “No, really.”She kissed him fondly and petted him, until, in a little while,the child, worn out with fatigue and excitement, fell asleep. Sheremained leaning over him for a long time. She herself seemed verymuch worn out and in need of rest.Lupin did not disturb her contemplation. He looked at heranxiously, with an attention which she did not perceive, and henoticed the wider rings round her eyes and the deeper marks ofwrinkles. Yet he considered her handsomer than he had thought, withthat touching beauty which habitual suffering gives to certainfaces that are more human, more sensitive than others.She wore so sad an expression that, in a burst of instinctivesympathy, he went up to her and said: “I do not know what yourplans are, but, whatever they may be, you stand in need of help.You cannot succeed alone.”“I am not alone.”“The two men outside? I know them. They’re no good. I beseech you,make use of me. You remember the other evening, at the theatre, inthe private box? You were on the point of speaking. Do not hesitateto-day.”She turned her eyes on him, looked at him long and fixedly and, asthough unable to escape that opposing will, she said:“What do you know exactly? What do you know about me?”“There are many things that I do not know. I do not know your name.But I know....”She interrupted him with a gesture; and, resolutely, in her turn,dominating the man who was compelling her to speak:“It doesn’t matter,” she exclaimed. “What you know, after all,is not much and is of no importance. But what are your plans?You offer me your help: with what view? For what work? You haveflung yourself headlong into this business; I have been unable toundertake anything without meeting you on my path: you must becontemplating some aim.... What aim?”“What aim? Upon my word, it seems to me that my conduct....”“No, no,” she said, emphatically, “no phrases! What you and I wantis certainties; and, to achieve them, absolute frankness. I willset you the example. M. Daubrecq possesses a thing of unparalleledvalue, not in itself, but for what it represents. That thing youknow. You have twice held it in your hands. I have twice takenit from you. Well, I am entitled to believe that, when you triedto obtain possession of it, you meant to use the power which youattribute to it and to use it to your own advantage....”“What makes you say that?”“Yes, you meant to use it to forward your schemes, in the interestof your own affairs, in accordance with your habits as a....”“As a burglar and a swindler,” said Lupin, completing the sentencefor her.She did not protest. He tried to read her secret thoughts in thedepths of her eyes. What did she want with him? What was she afraidof? If she mistrusted him, had he not also reasons to mistrustthat woman who had twice taken the crystal stopper from him torestore it to Daubrecq? Mortal enemy of Daubrecq’s though she were,up to what point did she remain subject to that man’s will? Bysurrendering himself to her, did he not risk surrendering himselfto Daubrecq? And yet he had never looked upon graver eyes nor amore honest face.Without further hesitation, he stated:“My object is simple enough. It is the release of my friendsGilbert and Vaucheray.”“Is that true? Is that true?” she exclaimed, quivering all over andquestioning him with an anxious glance.“If you knew me....”“I do know you.... I know who you are. For months, I have takenpart in your life, without your suspecting it . . . and yet, forcertain reasons, I still doubt....”He said, in a more decisive tone:“You do not know me. If you knew me, you would know that there canbe no peace for me before my two companions have escaped the awfulfate that awaits them.”She rushed at him, took him by the shoulders and positivelydistraught, said:“What? What did you say? The awful fate?... Then you believe . . .you believe....”“I really believe,” said Lupin, who felt how greatly this threatupset her, “I really believe that, if I am not in time, Gilbert andVaucheray are done for.”[Illustration: “Be quiet!... Be quiet!” she cried, clutching himfiercely. “You mustn’t say that.”]“Be quiet!... Be quiet!” she cried, clutching him fiercely. “Bequiet!... You mustn’t say that.... There is no reason.... It’s justyou who suppose....”“It’s not only I, it’s Gilbert as well....”“What? Gilbert? How do you know?”“From himself?”“From him?”“Yes, from Gilbert, who has no hope left but in me; from Gilbert,who knows that only one man in the world can save him and who, afew days ago, sent me a despairing appeal from prison. Here is hisletter.”She snatched the paper greedily and read in stammering accents:    “Help, governor!... I am frightened!... I am frightened!...”She dropped the letter. Her hands fluttered in space. It was asthough her staring eyes beheld the sinister vision which hadalready so often terrified Lupin. She gave a scream of horror,tried to rise and fainted.']"
83,7,Chapter 7,"['V.THE TWENTY-SEVENThe child was sleeping peacefully on the bed. The mother did notmove from the sofa on which Lupin had laid her; but her easierbreathing and the blood which was now returning to her faceannounced her impending recovery from her swoon.He observed that she wore a wedding-ring. Seeing a locket hangingfrom her bodice, he stooped and, turning it, found a miniaturephotograph representing a man of about forty and a lad--a striplingrather--in a schoolboy’s uniform. He studied the fresh, young faceset in curly hair:“It’s as I thought,” he said. “Ah, poor woman!”The hand which he took between his grew warmer by degrees. The eyesopened, then closed again. She murmured:“Jacques....”“Do not distress yourself . . . it’s all right he’s asleep.”She recovered consciousness entirely. But, as she did not speak,Lupin put questions to her, to make her feel a gradual need ofunbosoming herself. And he said, pointing to the locket:“The schoolboy is Gilbert, isn’t he?”“Yes,” she said.“And Gilbert is your son?”She gave a shiver and whispered:“Yes, Gilbert is my son, my eldest son.”So she was the mother of Gilbert, of Gilbert the prisoner at theSanté, relentlessly pursued by the authorities and now awaiting histrial for murder!Lupin continued:“And the other portrait?”“My husband.”“Your husband?”“Yes, he died three years ago.”She was now sitting up. Life quivered in her veins once more,together with the horror of living and the horror of all theghastly things that threatened her. Lupin went on to ask:“What was your husband’s name?”She hesitated a moment and answered:“Mergy.”He exclaimed:“Victorien Mergy the deputy?”“Yes.”There was a long pause. Lupin remembered the incident and the stirwhich it had caused. Three years ago, Mergy the deputy had blownout his brains in the lobby of the Chamber, without leaving a wordof explanation behind him; and no one had ever discovered theslightest reason for that suicide.“Do you know the reason?” asked Lupin, completing his thought aloud.“Yes, I know it.”“Gilbert, perhaps?”“No, Gilbert had disappeared for some years, turned out of doorsand cursed by my husband. It was a very great sorrow, but there wasanother motive.”“What was that?” asked Lupin.But it was not necessary for Lupin to put further questions. MadameMergy could keep silent no longer and, slowly at first, with allthe anguish of that past which had to be called up, she told herstory:“Twenty-five years ago, when my name was Clarisse Darcel and myparents living, I knew three young men at Nice. Their names willat once give you an insight into the present tragedy: they wereAlexis Daubrecq, Victorien Mergy and Louis Prasville. The threewere old acquaintances, had gone to college in the same year andserved in the same regiment. Prasville, at that time, was in lovewith a singer at the opera-house at Nice. The two others, Mergy andDaubrecq, were in love with me. I shall be brief as regards allthis and, for the rest, as regards the whole story, for the factstell their own tale. I fell in love with Victorien Mergy from thefirst. Perhaps I was wrong not to declare myself at once. But truelove is always timid, hesitating and shy; and I did not announce mychoice until I felt quite certain and quite free. Unfortunately,that period of waiting, so delightful for those who cherish asecret passion, had permitted Daubrecq to hope. His anger wassomething horrible.”Clarisse Mergy stopped for a few seconds and resumed, in a stifledvoice:“I shall never forget it.... The three of us were in thedrawing-room. Oh, I can hear even now the terrible words of threatand hatred which he uttered! Victorien was absolutely astounded.He had never seen his friend like this, with that repugnant face,that bestial expression: yes, the expression of a wild beast....Daubrecq ground his teeth. He stamped his feet. His bloodshoteyes--he did not wear spectacles in those days--rolled in theirsockets; and he kept on saying, ‘I shall be revenged.... I shall berevenged.... Oh, you don’t know what I am capable of!... I shallwait ten years, twenty years, if necessary.... But it will comelike a thunderbolt.... Ah, you don’t know!... To be revenged....To do harm . . . for harm’s sake... what joy! I was born to doharm.... And you will both beseech my mercy on your knees, on yourknees, yes, on your knees....’ At that moment, my father enteredthe room; and, with his assistance and the footman’s, VictorienMergy flung the loathsome creature out of doors. Six weeks later, Imarried Victorien.”“And Daubrecq?” asked Lupin, interrupting her. “Did he not try....”“No, but on our wedding-day, Louis Prasville, who acted as myhusband’s best man in defiance of Daubrecq’s opposition, went hometo find the girl he loved, the opera-singer, dead, strangled....”“What!” said Lupin, with a start. “Had Daubrecq....”“It was known that Daubrecq had been persecuting her with hisattentions for some days; but nothing more was known. It wasimpossible to discover who had gone in or out during Prasville’sabsence. There was not a trace found of any kind: nothing,absolutely nothing.”“But Prasville....”“There was no doubt of the truth in Prasville’s mind or ours.Daubrecq had tried to run away with the girl, perhaps tried toforce her, to hustle her and, in the course of the struggle,maddened, losing his head, caught her by the throat and killedher, perhaps without knowing what he was doing. But there was noevidence of all this; and Daubrecq was not even molested.”“And what became of him next?”“For some years we heard nothing of him. We knew only that he hadlost all his money gambling and that he was travelling in America.And, in spite of myself, I forgot his anger and his threats andwas only too ready to believe that he had ceased to love me and nolonger harboured his schemes of revenge. Besides, I was so happythat I did not care to think of anything but my happiness, my love,my husband’s political career, the health of my son Antoine.”“Antoine?”“Yes, Antoine is Gilbert’s real name. The unhappy boy has at leastsucceeded in concealing his identity.”Lupin asked, with some hesitation:“At what period did . . . Gilbert . . . begin?”“I cannot tell you exactly. Gilbert--I prefer to call him that andnot to pronounce his real name--Gilbert, as a child, was what he isto-day: lovable, liked by everybody, charming, but lazy and unruly.When he was fifteen, we put him to a boarding-school in one of thesuburbs, with the deliberate object of not having him too much athome. After two years’ time he was expelled from school and sentback to us.”“Why?”“Because of his conduct. The masters had discovered that he used toslip out at night and also that he would disappear for weeks at atime, while pretending to be at home with us.”“What used he to do?”“Amuse himself backing horses, spending his time in cafés andpublic dancing-rooms.”“Then he had money?”“Yes.”“Who gave it him?”“His evil genius, the man who, secretly, unknown to his parents,enticed him away from school, the man who led him astray, whocorrupted him, who took him from us, who taught him to lie, towaste his substance and to steal.”“Daubrecq?”“Daubrecq.”Clarisse Mergy put her hands together to hide the blushes on herforehead. She continued, in her tired voice:“Daubrecq had taken his revenge. On the day after my husband turnedour unhappy child out of the house, Daubrecq sent us a most cynicalletter in which he revealed the odious part which he had playedand the machinations by which he had succeeded in depraving ourson. And he went on to say, ‘The reformatory, one of these days....Later on, the assize-court.... And then, let us hope and trust, thescaffold!’”Lupin exclaimed:“What! Did Daubrecq plot the present business?”“No, no, that is only an accident. The hateful prophecy wasjust a wish which he expressed. But oh, how it terrified me! Iwas ailing at the time; my other son, my little Jacques, hadjust been born. And every day we heard of some fresh misdeed ofGilbert’s--forgeries, swindles--so much so that we spread thenews, in our immediate surroundings, of his departure for abroad,followed by his death. Life was a misery; and it became still moreso when the political storm burst in which my husband was to meethis death.”“What do you mean?”“A word will be enough: my husband’s name was on the list of theTwenty-seven.”“Ah!”The veil was suddenly lifted from Lupin’s eyes and he saw, as in aflash of lightning, a whole legion of things which, until then, hadbeen hidden in the darkness.Clarisse Mergy continued, in a firmer voice:“Yes, his name was on it, but by mistake, by a piece of incredibleill-luck of which he was the victim. It is true that VictorienMergy was a member of the committee appointed to consider thequestion of the Two-Seas Canal. It is true that he voted with themembers who were in favour of the company’s scheme. He was evenpaid--yes, I tell you so plainly and I will mention the sum--hewas paid fifteen thousand francs. But he was paid on behalf ofanother, of one of his political friends, a man in whom he hadabsolute confidence and of whom he was the blind, unconscious tool.He thought he was showing his friend a kindness; and it proved hisown undoing. It was not until the day after the suicide of thechairman of the company and the disappearance of the secretary,the day on which the affair of the canal was published in thepapers, with its whole series of swindles and abominations, that myhusband knew that a number of his fellow-members had been bribedand learnt that the mysterious list, of which people suddenly beganto speak, mentioned his name with theirs and with the names ofother deputies, leaders of parties and influential politicians. Oh,what awful days those were! Would the list be published? Would hisname come out? The torture of it! You remember the mad excitementin the Chamber, the atmosphere of terror and denunciation thatprevailed. Who owned the list? Nobody could say. It was known tobe in existence and that was all. Two names were sacrificed topublic odium. Two men were swept away by the storm. And it remainedunknown where the denunciation came from and in whose hands theincriminating documents were.”“Daubrecq,” suggested Lupin.“No, no!” cried Madame Mergy. “Daubrecq was nothing at that time:he had not yet appeared upon the scene. No, don’t you remember,the truth came out suddenly through the very man who was keepingit back: Germineaux, the ex-minister of justice, a cousin of thechairman of the Canal Company. As he lay dying of consumption,he wrote from his sick-bed to the prefect of police, bequeathinghim that list of names, which, he said, would be found, after hisdeath, in an iron chest in the corner of his room. The house wassurrounded by police and the prefect took up his quarters by thesick man’s bedside. Germineaux died. The chest was opened and foundto be empty.”“Daubrecq, this time,” Lupin declared.“Yes, Daubrecq,” said Madame Mergy, whose excitement wasmomentarily increasing. “Alexis Daubrecq, who, for six months,disguised beyond recognition, had acted as Germineaux’s secretary.It does not matter how he discovered that Germineaux was thepossessor of the paper in question. The fact remains that he brokeopen the chest on the night before the death. So much was proved atthe inquiry; and Daubrecq’s identity was established.”“But he was not arrested?”“What would have been the use? They knew well enough that he musthave deposited the list in a place of safety. His arrest would haveinvolved a scandal, the reopening of the whole case....”“So....”“So they made terms.”Lupin laughed:“That’s funny, making terms with Daubrecq!”“Yes, very funny,” said Madame Mergy, bitterly. “During this timehe acted and without delay, shamelessly, making straight for thegoal. A week after the theft, he went to the Chamber of Deputies,asked for my husband and bluntly demanded thirty thousand francs ofhim, to be paid within twenty-four hours. If not, he threatened himwith exposure and disgrace. My husband knew the man he was dealingwith, knew him to be implacable and filled with relentless hatred.He lost his head and shot himself.”“How absurd!” Lupin could not help saying. “How absurd! Daubrecqpossesses a list of twenty-seven names. To give up any one of thosenames he is obliged, if he would have his accusation believed, topublish the list itself--that is to say, to part with the document,or at least a photograph of it. Well, in so doing, he creates ascandal, it is true, but he deprives himself, at the same time, ofall further means of levying blackmail.”“Yes and no,” she said.“How do you know?”“Through Daubrecq himself. The villain came to see me and cynicallytold me of his interview with my husband and the words that hadpassed between them. Well, there is more than that list, morethan that famous bit of paper on which the secretary put down thenames and the amounts paid and to which, you will remember, thechairman of the company, before dying, affixed his signature inletters of blood. There is more than that. There are certain lesspositive proofs, which the people interested do not know of: thecorrespondence between the chairman and the secretary, between thechairman and his counsel, and so on. Of course, the list scribbledon the bit of paper is the only evidence that counts; it is theone incontestable proof which it would be no good copying or evenphotographing, for its genuineness can be tested most absolutely.But, all the same, the other proofs are dangerous. They havealready been enough to do away with two deputies. And Daubrecq ismarvelously clever at turning this fact to account. He selects hisvictim, frightens him out of his senses, points out to him theinevitable scandal; and the victim pays the required sum. Or elsehe kills himself, as my husband did. Do you understand now?”“Yes,” said Lupin.And, in the silence that followed, he drew a mental picture ofDaubrecq’s life. He saw him the owner of that list, using hispower, gradually emerging from the shadow, lavishly squandering themoney which he extorted from his victims, securing his election asa district-councillor and deputy, holding sway by dint of threatsand terror, unpunished, invulnerable, unattackable, feared by thegovernment, which would rather submit to his orders than declarewar upon him, respected by the judicial authorities: so powerful,in a word, that Prasville had been appointed secretary-general ofpolice, over the heads of all who had prior claims, for the solereason that he hated Daubrecq with a personal hatred.“And you saw him again?” he asked.“I saw him again. I had to. My husband was dead, but his honourremained untouched. Nobody suspected the truth. In order at leastto defend the name which he left me, I accepted my first interviewwith Daubrecq.”“Your first, yes, for there have been others.”“Many others,” she said, in a strained voice, “yes, manyothers . . . at the theatre . . . or in the evening, atEnghien . . . or else in Paris, at night . . . for I was ashamed tomeet that man and I did not want people to know it.... But it wasnecessary.... A duty more imperative than any other commanded it:the duty of avenging my husband....”She bent over Lupin and, eagerly:“Yes, revenge has been the motive of my conduct and the solepreoccupation of my life. To avenge my husband, to avenge my ruinedson, to avenge myself for all the harm that he has done me: I hadno other dream, no other object in life. That is what I wanted: tosee that man crushed, reduced to poverty, to tears--as though hestill knew how to cry!--sobbing in the throes of despair....”“You wanted his death,” said Lupin, remembering the scene betweenthem in Daubrecq’s study.“No, not his death. I have often thought of it, I have even raisedmy arm to strike him, but what would have been the good? He musthave taken his precautions. The paper would remain. And then thereis no revenge in killing a man.... My hatred went further thanthat.... It demanded his ruin, his downfall; and, to achieve that,there was but one way: to cut his claws. Daubrecq, deprived ofthe document that gives him his immense power, ceases to exist.It means immediate bankruptcy and disaster . . . under the mostwretched conditions. That is what I have sought.”“But Daubrecq must have been aware of your intentions?”“Certainly. And, I assure you, those were strange meetings of ours:I watching him closely, trying to guess his secret behind hisactions and his words, and he . . . he....”“And he,” said Lupin, finishing Clarisse’s thought, “lying in waitfor the prey which he desires . . . for the woman whom he has neverceased to love . . . whom he loves . . . and whom he covets withall his might and with all his furious passion....”She lowered her head and said, simply:“Yes.”A strange duel indeed was that which brought face to face thosetwo beings separated by so many implacable things! How unbridledmust Daubrecq’s passion be for him to risk that perpetual threat ofdeath and to introduce to the privacy of his house this woman whoselife he had shattered! But also how absolutely safe he must feelhimself!“And your search ended . . . how?” asked Lupin.“My search,” she replied, “long remained without fruit. You knowthe methods of investigation which you have followed and which thepolice have followed on their side. Well, I myself employed them,years before either of you did, and in vain. I was beginning todespair. Then, one day, when I had gone to see Daubrecq in hisvilla at Enghien, I picked up under his writing-table a letterwhich he had begun to write, crumpled up and thrown into thewaste-paper-basket. It consisted of a few lines in bad English;and I was able to read this: ‘Empty the crystal within, so as toleave a void which it is impossible to suspect.’ Perhaps I shouldnot have attached to this sentence all the importance which itdeserved, if Daubrecq, who was out in the garden, had not comerunning in and begun to turn out the waste-paper-basket, with aneagerness which was very significant. He gave me a suspicious look:‘There was a letter there,’ he said. I pretended not to understand.He did not insist, but his agitation did not escape me; and Icontinued my quest in this direction. A month later, I discovered,among the ashes in the drawing-room fireplace, the torn half of anEnglish invoice. I gathered that a Stourbridge glass-blower, of thename of John Howard, had supplied Daubrecq with a crystal bottlemade after a model. The word ‘crystal’ struck me at once. I went toStourbridge, got round the foreman of the glass-works and learntthat the stopper of this bottle had been hollowed out inside, inaccordance with the instruction in the order, so as to leave acavity, the existence of which would escape observation.”Lupin nodded his head:“The thing tallies beyond a doubt. Nevertheless, it did not seem tome, that, even under the gilt layer.... And then the hiding-placewould be very tiny!”“Tiny, but large enough,” she said. “On my return from England,I went to the police-office to see Prasville, whose friendshipfor me had remained unchanged. I did not hesitate to tell him,first, the reasons which had driven my husband to suicide and,secondly, the object of revenge which I was pursuing. When Iinformed him of my discoveries, he jumped for joy; and I feltthat his hatred for Daubrecq was as strong as ever. I learntfrom him that the list was written on a slip of exceedingly thinforeign-post-paper, which, when rolled up into a sort of pellet,would easily fit into an exceedingly limited space. Neither he norI had the least hesitation. We knew the hiding-place. We agreed toact independently of each other, while continuing to correspondin secret. I put him in touch with Clémence, the portress in theSquare Lamartine, who was entirely devoted to me....”“But less so to Prasville,” said Lupin, “for I can prove that shebetrays him.”“Now perhaps, but not at the start; and the police searches werenumerous. It was at that time, ten months ago, that Gilbert cameinto my life again. A mother never loses her love for her son,whatever he may do, whatever he may have done. And then Gilbert hassuch a way with him . . . well, you know him. He cried, kissed mylittle Jacques, his brother and I forgave him.”She stopped and, weary-voiced, with her eyes fixed on the floor,continued:“Would to Heaven that I had not forgiven him! Ah, if that hourcould but return, how readily I should find the horrible courageto turn him away! My poor child . . . it was I who ruined him!...”And, pensively, “I should have had that or any sort of courage, ifhe had been as I pictured him to myself and as he himself told methat he had long been: bearing the marks of vice and dissipation,coarse, deteriorated.... But, though he was utterly changed inappearance, so much so that I could hardly recognize him, therewas, from the point of view of--how shall I put it?--from the moralpoint of view, an undoubted improvement. You had helped him, liftedhim; and, though his mode of life was hateful to me, neverthelesshe retained a certain self-respect . . . a sort of underlyingdecency that showed itself on the surface once more.... He was gay,careless, happy.... And he used to talk of you with such affection!”She picked her words, betraying her embarrassment, not daring, inLupin’s presence, to condemn the line of life which Gilbert hadselected and yet unable to speak in favour of it.“What happened next?” asked Lupin.“I saw him very often. He would come to me by stealth, or else Iwent to him and we would go for walks in the country. In this way,I was gradually induced to tell him our story, of his father’ssuicide and the object which I was pursuing. He at once took fire.He too wanted to avenge his father and, by stealing the crystalstopper, to avenge himself on Daubrecq for the harm which he haddone him. His first idea--from which, I am bound to tell you, henever swerved--was to arrange with you.”“Well, then,” cried Lupin, “he ought to have....!”“Yes, I know . . . and I was of the same opinion. Unfortunately, mypoor Gilbert--you know how weak he is!--was under the influence ofone of his comrades.”“Vaucheray?”“Yes, Vaucheray, a saturnine spirit, full of bitterness and envy,an ambitious, unscrupulous, gloomy, crafty man, who had acquired agreat empire over my son. Gilbert made the mistake of confiding inhim and asking his advice. That was the origin of all the mischief.Vaucheray convinced him and convinced me as well that it would bebetter if we acted by ourselves. He studied the business, tookthe lead and finally organized the Enghien expedition and, underyour direction, the burglary at the Villa Marie-Thérèse, whichPrasville and his detectives had been unable to search thoroughly,because of the active watch maintained by Léonard the valet. It wasa mad scheme. We ought either to have trusted in your experienceentirely, or else to have left you out altogether, taking the riskof fatal mistakes and dangerous hesitations. But we could not helpourselves. Vaucheray ruled us. I agreed to meet Daubrecq at thetheatre. During this time the thing took place. When I came home,at twelve o’clock at night, I heard the terrible result: Léonardmurdered, my son arrested. I at once received an intuition of thefuture. Daubrecq’s appalling prophecy was being realized: it meanttrial and sentence. And this through my fault, through the fault ofme, the mother, who had driven my son toward the abyss from whichnothing could extricate him now.”Clarisse wrung her hands and shivered from head to foot. Whatsuffering can compare with that of a mother trembling for the headof her son? Stirred with pity, Lupin said:“We shall save him. Of that there is not the shadow of a doubt.But, it is necessary that I should know all the details. Finishyour story, please. How did you know, on the same night, what hadhappened at Enghien?”She mastered herself and, with a face wrung with fevered anguish,replied:“Through two of your accomplices, or rather two accomplices ofVaucheray, to whom they were wholly devoted and who had chosen themto row the boats.”“The two men outside: the Growler and the Masher?”“Yes. On your return from the villa, when you landed after beingpursued on the lake by the commissary of police, you said a fewwords to them, by way of explanation, as you went to your car. Madwith fright, they rushed to my place, where they had been before,and told me the hideous news. Gilbert was in prison! Oh, whatan awful night! What was I to do? Look for you? Certainly; andimplore your assistance. But where was I to find you?... It wasthen that the two whom you call the Growler and the Masher, driveninto a corner by circumstances, decided to tell me of the partplayed by Vaucheray, his ambitions, his plan, which had long beenripening....”“To get rid of me, I suppose?” said Lupin, with a grin.“Yes. As Gilbert possessed your complete confidence, Vaucheraywatched him and, in this way, got to know all the places which youlive at. A few days more and, owning the crystal stopper, holdingthe list of the Twenty-seven, inheriting all Daubrecq’s power, hewould have delivered you to the police, without compromising asingle member of your gang, which he looked upon as thenceforth his.”“The ass!” muttered Lupin. “A muddler like that!” And he added, “Sothe panels of the doors....”“Were cut out by his instructions, in anticipation of the conteston which he was embarking against you and against Daubrecq, atwhose house he did the same thing. He had under his orders asort of acrobat, an extraordinarily thin dwarf, who was able towriggle through those apertures and who thus detected all yourcorrespondence and all your secrets. That is what his two friendsrevealed to me. I at once conceived the idea of saving my elder sonby making use of his brother, my little Jacques, who is himselfso slight and so intelligent, so plucky, as you have seen. We setout that night. Acting on the information of my companions, I wentto Gilbert’s rooms and found the keys of your flat in the RueMatignon, where it appeared that you were to sleep. Unfortunately,I changed my mind on the way and thought much less of asking foryour help than of recovering the crystal stopper, which, if it hadbeen discovered at Enghien, must obviously be at your flat. I wasright in my calculations. In a few minutes, my little Jacques,who had slipped into your bedroom, brought it to me. I went awayquivering with hope. Mistress in my turn of the talisman, keepingit to myself, without telling Prasville, I had absolute power overDaubrecq. I could make him do all that I wanted; he would becomethe slave of my will and, instructed by me, would take every stepin Gilbert’s favour and obtain that he should be given the means ofescape or else that he should not be sentenced. It meant my boy’ssafety.”“Well?”Clarisse rose from her seat, with a passionate movement of herwhole being, leant over Lupin and said, in a hollow voice:“There was nothing in that piece of crystal, nothing, do youunderstand? No paper, no hiding-place! The whole expedition toEnghien was futile! The murder of Léonard was useless! The arrestof my son was useless! All my efforts were useless!”“But why? Why?”“Why? Because what you stole from Daubrecq was not the stopper madeby his instructions, but the stopper which was sent to John Howard,the Stourbridge glassworker, to serve as a model.”If Lupin had not been in the presence of so deep a grief, he couldnot have refrained from one of those satirical outbursts with whichthe mischievous tricks of fate are wont to inspire him. As it was,he muttered between his teeth:“How stupid! And still more stupid as Daubrecq had been given thewarning.”“No,” she said. “I went to Enghien on the same day. In all thatbusiness Daubrecq saw and sees nothing but an ordinary burglary, anannexation of his treasures. The fact that you took part in it puthim off the scent.”“Still, the disappearance of the stopper....”“To begin with, the thing can have had but a secondary importancefor him, as it is only the model.”“How do you know?”“There is a scratch at the bottom of the stem; and I have madeinquiries in England since.”“Very well; but why did the key of the cupboard from which it wasstolen never leave the man-servant’s possession? And why, in thesecond place, was it found afterward in the drawer of a table inDaubrecq’s house in Paris?”“Of course, Daubrecq takes care of it and clings to it in the wayin which one clings to the model of any valuable thing. And that iswhy I replaced the stopper in the cupboard before its absence wasnoticed. And that also is why, on the second occasion, I made mylittle Jacques take the stopper from your overcoat-pocket and toldthe portress to put it back in the drawer.”“Then he suspects nothing?”“Nothing. He knows that the list is being looked for, but he doesnot know that Prasville and I are aware of the thing in which hehides it.”Lupin had risen from his seat and was walking up and down the room,thinking. Then he stood still beside Clarisse and asked:“When all is said, since the Enghien incident, you have notadvanced a single step?”“Not one. I have acted from day to day, led by those two men orleading them, without any definite plan.”“Or, at least,” he said, “without any other plan than that ofgetting the list of the Twenty-seven from Daubrecq.”“Yes, but how? Besides, your tactics made things more difficult forme. It did not take us long to recognize your old servant Victoirein Daubrecq’s new cook and to discover, from what the portress toldus, that Victoire was putting you up in her room; and I was afraidof your schemes.”“It was you, was it not, who wrote to me to retire from thecontest?”“Yes.”“You also asked me not to go to the theatre on the Vaudevillenight?”“Yes, the portress caught Victoire listening to Daubrecq’sconversation with me on the telephone; and the Masher, who waswatching the house, saw you go out. I suspected, therefore, thatyou would follow Daubrecq that evening.”“And the woman who came here, late one afternoon....”“Was myself. I felt disheartened and wanted to see you.”“And you intercepted Gilbert’s letter?”“Yes, I recognized his writing on the envelope.”“But your little Jacques was not with you?”“No, he was outside, in a motor-car, with the Masher, who liftedhim up to me through the drawing-room window; and he slipped intoyour bedroom through the opening in the panel.”“What was in the letter?”“As ill-luck would have it, reproaches. Gilbert accused you offorsaking him, of taking over the business on your own account. Inshort, it confirmed me in my distrust; and I ran away.”Lupin shrugged his shoulders with irritation:“What a shocking waste of time! And what a fatality that we werenot able to come to an understanding earlier! You and I have beenplaying at hide-and-seek, laying absurd traps for each other, whilethe days were passing, precious days beyond repair.”“You see, you see,” she said, shivering, “you too are afraid of thefuture!”“No, I am not afraid,” cried Lupin. “But I am thinking of all theuseful work that we could have done by this time, if we had unitedour efforts. I am thinking of all the mistakes and all the acts ofimprudence which we should have been saved, if we had been workingtogether. I am thinking that your attempt to-night to search theclothes which Daubrecq was wearing was as vain as the others andthat, at this moment, thanks to our foolish duel, thanks to the dinwhich we raised in his house, Daubrecq is warned and will be moreon his guard than ever.”Clarisse Mergy shook her head:“No, no, I don’t think that; the noise will not have roused him,for we postponed the attempt for twenty-four hours so that theportress might put a narcotic in his wine.” And she added, slowly,“And then, you see, nothing can make Daubrecq be more on his guardthan he is already. His life is nothing but one mass of precautionsagainst danger. He leaves nothing to chance.... Besides, has he notall the trumps in his hand?”Lupin went up to her and asked:“What do you mean to convey? According to you, is there nothing tohope for on that side? Is there not a single means of attaining ourend?”“Yes,” she murmured, “there is one, one only....”He noticed her pallor before she had time to hide her face betweenher hands again. And again a feverish shiver shook her frame.He seemed to understand the reason of her dismay; and, bendingtoward her, touched by her grief:“Please,” he said, “please answer me openly and frankly. It’s forGilbert’s sake, is it not? Though the police, fortunately, have notbeen able to solve the riddle of his past, though the real name ofVaucheray’s accomplice has not leaked out, there is one man, atleast, who knows it: isn’t that so? Daubrecq has recognized yourson Antoine, through the alias of Gilbert, has he not?”“Yes, yes....”“And he promises to save him, doesn’t he? He offers you hisfreedom, his release, his escape, his life: that was what heoffered you, was it not, on the night in his study, when you triedto stab him?”“Yes . . . yes . . . that was it....”“And he makes one condition, does he not? An abominable condition,such as would suggest itself to a wretch like that? I am right, amI not?”Clarisse did not reply. She seemed exhausted by her protractedstruggle with a man who was gaining ground daily and against whomit was impossible for her to fight. Lupin saw in her the preyconquered in advance, delivered to the victor’s whim. ClarisseMergy, the loving wife of that Mergy whom Daubrecq had reallymurdered, the terrified mother of that Gilbert whom Daubrecq hadled astray, Clarisse Mergy, to save her son from the scaffold,must, come what may and however ignominious the position, yieldto Daubrecq’s wishes. She would be the mistress, the wife, theobedient slave of Daubrecq, of that monster with the appearance andthe ways of a wild beast, that unspeakable person of whom Lupincould not think without revulsion and disgust.Sitting down beside her, gently, with gestures of pity, he made herlift her head and, with his eyes on hers, said:“Listen to me. I swear that I will save your son: I swear it....Your son shall not die, do you understand?... There is not a poweron earth that can allow your son’s head to be touched as long as Iam alive.”“I believe you.... I trust your word.”“Do. It is the word of a man who does not know defeat. I shallsucceed. Only, I entreat you to make me an irrevocable promise.”“What is that?”“You must not see Daubrecq again.”“I swear it.”“You must put from your mind any idea, any fear, however obscure,of an understanding between yourself and him . . . of any sort ofbargain....”“I swear it.”She looked at him with an expression of absolute security andreliance; and he, under her gaze, felt the joy of devotion and anardent longing to restore that woman’s happiness, or, at least, togive her the peace and oblivion that heal the worst wounds:“Come,” he said, in a cheerful tone, rising from his chair, “allwill yet be well. We have two months, three months before us.It is more than I need . . . on condition, of course, that Iam unhampered in my movements. And, for that, you will have towithdraw from the contest, you know.”“How do you mean?”“Yes, you must disappear for a time; go and live in the country.Have you no pity for your little Jacques? This sort of thing wouldend by shattering the poor little man’s nerves.... And he hascertainly earned his rest, haven’t you, Hercules?”       *       *       *       *       *The next day Clarisse Mergy, who was nearly breaking down under thestrain of events and who herself needed repose, lest she shouldfall seriously ill, went, with her son, to board with a friend whohad a house on the skirt of the Forest of Saint-Germain. She feltvery weak, her brain was haunted by visions and her nerves wereupset by troubles which the least excitement aggravated. She livedthere for some days in a state of physical and mental inertia,thinking of nothing and forbidden to see the papers.One afternoon, while Lupin, changing his tactics, was working outa scheme for kidnapping and confining Daubrecq; while the Growlerand the Masher, whom he had promised to forgive if he succeeded,were watching the enemy’s movements; while the newspapers wereannouncing the forthcoming trial for murder of Arsène Lupin’s twoaccomplices, one afternoon, at four o’clock, the telephone-bellrang suddenly in the flat in the Rue Chateaubriand.Lupin took down the receiver:“Hullo!”A woman’s voice, a breathless voice, said:“M. Michel Beaumont?”“You are speaking to him, madame. To whom have I the honour....”“Quick, monsieur, come at once; Madame Mergy has taken poison.”Lupin did not wait to hear details. He rushed out, sprang into hismotor-car and drove to Saint-Germain.Clarisse’s friend was waiting for him at the door of the bedroom.“Dead?” he asked.“No,” she replied, “she did not take sufficient. The doctor hasjust gone. He says she will get over it.”“And why did she make the attempt?”“Her son Jacques has disappeared.”“Carried off?”“Yes, he was playing just inside the forest. A motor-car was seenpulling up. Then there were screams. Clarisse tried to run, but herstrength failed and she fell to the ground, moaning, ‘It’s he . . .it’s that man . . . all is lost!’ She looked like a madwoman.”“Suddenly, she put a little bottle to her lips and swallowed thecontents.”“What happened next?”“My husband and I carried her to her room. She was in great pain.”“How did you know my address, my name?”“From herself, while the doctor was attending to her. Then Itelephoned to you.”“Has any one else been told?”“No, nobody. I know that Clarisse has had terrible things tobear . . . and that she prefers not to be talked about.”“Can I see her?”“She is asleep just now. And the doctor has forbidden allexcitement.”“Is the doctor anxious about her?”“He is afraid of a fit of fever, any nervous strain, an attack ofsome kind which might cause her to make a fresh attempt on herlife. And that would be....”“What is needed to avoid it?”“A week or a fortnight of absolute quiet, which is impossible aslong as her little Jacques....”Lupin interrupted her:“You think that, if she got her son back....”“Oh, certainly, there would be nothing more to fear!”“You’re sure? You’re sure?... Yes, of course you are!... Well, whenMadame Mergy wakes, tell her from me that I will bring her back herson this evening, before midnight. This evening, before midnight:it’s a solemn promise.”With these words, Lupin hurried out of the house and, stepping intohis car, shouted to the driver:“Go to Paris, Square Lamartine, Daubrecq the deputy’s!”']"
83,8,Chapter 8,"['VI.THE DEATH-SENTENCELupin’s motor-car was not only an office, a writing-room furnishedwith books, stationery, pens and ink, but also a regular actor’sdressing-room, containing a complete make-up box, a trunk filledwith every variety of wearing-apparel, another crammed with“properties”--umbrellas, walking-sticks, scarves, eye-glasses andso on--in short, a complete set of paraphernalia which enabled himto alter his appearance from top to toe in the course of a drive.The man who rang at Daubrecq the deputy’s gate, at six o-clock thatevening, was a stout, elderly gentleman, in a black frock-coat, abowler hat, spectacles and whiskers.The portress took him to the front-door of the house and rang thebell. Victoire appeared.Lupin asked:“Can M. Daubrecq see Dr. Vernes?”“M. Daubrecq is in his bedroom; and it is rather late....”“Give him my card, please.”He wrote the words, “From Mme. Mergy,” in the margin and added:“There, he is sure to see me.”“But . . .” Victoire began.“Oh, drop your buts, old dear, do as I say, and don’t make such afuss about it!”She was utterly taken aback and stammered:“You! . . . is it you?”“No, it’s Louis XIV.!” And, pushing her into a corner of the hall,“Listen.... The moment I’m done with him, go up to your room, putyour things together anyhow and clear out.”“What!”“Do as I tell you. You’ll find my car waiting down the avenue.Come, stir your stumps! Announce me. I’ll wait in the study.”“But it’s dark in there.”“Turn on the light.”She switched on the electric light and left Lupin alone.“It’s here,” he reflected, as he took a seat, “it’s here thatthe crystal stopper lives.... Unless Daubrecq always keeps it byhim.... But no, when people have a good hiding-place, they make useof it. And this is a capital one; for none of us . . . so far....”Concentrating all his attention, he examined the objects in theroom; and he remembered the note which Daubrecq wrote to Prasville:    “Within reach of your hand, my dear Prasville!... You touched    it! A little more and the trick was done....”Nothing seemed to have moved since that day. The same things werelying about on the desk: books, account-books, a bottle of ink, astamp-box, pipes, tobacco, things that had been searched and probedover and over again.“The bounder!” thought Lupin. “He’s organized his business jollycleverly. It’s all dove-tailed like a well-made play.”In his heart of hearts, though he knew exactly what he had cometo do and how he meant to act, Lupin was thoroughly aware of thedanger and uncertainty attending his visit to so powerful anadversary. It was quite within the bounds of possibility thatDaubrecq, armed as he was, would remain master of the field andthat the conversation would take an absolutely different turn fromthat which Lupin anticipated.And this prospect angered him somewhat.He drew himself up, as he heard a sound of footsteps approaching.Daubrecq entered.He entered without a word, made a sign to Lupin, who had risenfrom his chair, to resume his seat and himself sat down at thewriting-desk. Glancing at the card which he held in his hand:“Dr. Vernes?”“Yes, monsieur le député, Dr. Vernes, of Saint-Germain.”“And I see that you come from Mme. Mergy. A patient of yours?”“A recent patient. I did not know her until I was called in to seeher, the other day, in particularly tragic circumstances.”“Is she ill?”“Mme. Mergy has taken poison.”“What!”Daubrecq gave a start and he continued, without concealing hisdistress:“What’s that you say? Poison! Is she dead?”“No, the dose was not large enough. If no complications ensue, Iconsider that Mme. Mergy’s life is saved.”Daubrecq said nothing and sat silent, with his head turned to Lupin.“Is he looking at me? Are his eyes open or shut?” Lupin askedhimself.It worried Lupin terribly not to see his adversary’s eyes, thoseeyes hidden by the double obstacle of spectacles and black glasses:weak, bloodshot eyes, Mme. Mergy had told him. How could he followthe secret train of the man’s thought without seeing the expressionof his face? It was almost like fighting an enemy who wielded aninvisible sword.Presently, Daubrecq spoke:“So Mme. Mergy’s life is saved.... And she has sent you to me.... Idon’t quite understand.... I hardly know the lady.”“Now for the ticklish moment,” thought Lupin. “Have at him!”And, in a genial, good-natured and rather shy tone, he said:“No, monsieur le député, there are cases in which a doctor’s dutybecomes very complex . . . very puzzling.... And you may thinkthat, in taking this step.... However, to cut a long story short,while I was attending Mme. Mergy, she made a second attempt topoison herself.... Yes; the bottle, unfortunately, had been leftwithin her reach. I snatched it from her. We had a struggle. And,railing in her fever, she said to me, in broken words, ‘He’s theman.... He’s the man.... Daubrecq the deputy.... Make him giveme back my son. Tell him to . . . or else I would rather die....Yes, now, to-night.... I would rather die.’ That’s what she said,monsieur le député.... So I thought that I ought to let you know.It is quite certain that, in the lady’s highly nervous state ofmind.... Of course, I don’t know the exact meaning of her words....I asked no questions of anybody . . . obeyed a spontaneous impulseand came straight to you.”Daubrecq reflected for a little while and said:“It amounts to this, doctor, that you have come to ask me if I knowthe whereabouts of this child whom I presume to have disappeared.Is that it?”“Yes.”“And, if I did happen to know, you would take him back to hismother?”There was a longer pause. Lupin asked himself:“Can he by chance have swallowed the story? Is the threat ofthat death enough? Oh, nonsense it’s out of the question!... Andyet . . . and yet . . . he seems to be hesitating.”“Will you excuse me?” asked Daubrecq, drawing the telephone, on hiswriting-desk, toward him. “I have an urgent message.”“Certainly, monsieur le député.”Daubrecq called out:“Hullo!... 822.19, please, 822.19.”Having repeated the number, he sat without moving.Lupin smiled:“The headquarters of police, isn’t it? The secretary-general’soffice....”“Yes, doctor.... How do you know?”“Oh, as a divisional surgeon, I sometimes have to ring them up.”And, within himself, Lupin asked:“What the devil does all this mean? The secretary-general isPrasville.... Then, what?...”Daubrecq put both receivers to his ears and said:“Are you 822.19? I want to speak to M. Prasville, thesecretary-general.... Do you say he’s not there?... Yes, yes,he is: he’s always in his office at this time.... Tell him it’sM. Daubrecq.... M. Daubrecq the deputy . . . a most importantcommunication.”“Perhaps I’m in the way?” Lupin suggested.“Not at all, doctor, not at all,” said Daubrecq. “Besides, what Ihave to say has a certain bearing on your errand.” And, into thetelephone, “Hullo! M. Prasville?... Ah, it’s you, Prasville, oldcock!... Why, you seem quite staggered! Yes, you’re right, it’san age since you and I met. But, after all, we’ve never been faraway in thought.... And I’ve had plenty of visits from you andyour henchmen.... In my absence, it’s true. Hullo!.... What?...Oh, you’re in a hurry? I beg your pardon!... So am I, for thatmatter.... Well, to come to the point, there’s a little service Iwant to do you.... Wait, can’t you, you brute?... You won’t regretit.... It concerns your renown.... Hullo!... Are you listening?...Well, take half-a-dozen men with you . . . plain-clothesdetectives, by preference: you’ll find them at the night-office....Jump into a taxi, two taxis, and come along here as fast as youcan.... I’ve got a rare quarry for you, old chap. One of the upperten . . . a lord, a marquis Napoleon himself . . . in a word,Arsène Lupin!”[Illustration: Lupin sprang to his feet. He was prepared for everyupshot except this.]Lupin sprang to his feet. He was prepared for everything but this.Yet something within him stronger than astonishment, an impulse ofhis whole nature, made him say, with a laugh:“Oh, well done, well done!”Daubrecq bowed his head, by way of thanks, and muttered:“I haven’t quite finished.... A little patience, if you don’tmind.” And he continued, “Hullo! Prasville!... No, no, old chap,I’m not humbugging.... You’ll find Lupin here, with me, in mystudy.... Lupin, who’s worrying me like the rest of you.... Oh,one more or less makes no difference to me! But, all the same,this one’s a bit too pushing. And I am appealing to your senseof kindness. Rid me of the fellow, do.... Half-a-dozen of yoursatellites and the two who are pacing up and down outside my housewill be enough.... Oh, while you’re about it, go up to the thirdfloor and rope in my cook as well.... She’s the famous Victoire:you know, Master Lupin’s old nurse.... And, look here, one moretip, to show you how I love you: send a squad of men to the RueChateaubriand, at the corner of the Rue Balzac.... That’s where ournational hero lives, under the name of Michel Beaumont.... Do youtwig, old cockalorum? And now to business. Hustle!”When Daubrecq turned his head, Lupin was standing up, with clenchedfists. His burst of admiration had not survived the rest of thespeech and the revelations which Daubrecq had made about Victoireand the flat in the Rue Chateaubriand. The humiliation was toogreat; and Lupin no longer bothered to play the part of the smallgeneral practitioner. He had but one idea in his head: not to giveway to the tremendous fit of rage that was urging him to rush atDaubrecq like a bull.Daubrecq gave the sort of little cluck which, with him, didduty for a laugh. He came waddling up, with his hands in histrouser-pockets, and said, incisively:“Don’t you think that this is all for the best? I’ve cleared theground, relieved the situation.... At least, we now know where westand. Lupin versus Daubrecq; and that’s all about it. Besides,think of the time saved! Dr. Vernes, the divisional surgeon, wouldhave taken two hours to spin his yarn! Whereas, like this, MasterLupin will be compelled to get his little story told in thirtyminutes . . . unless he wants to get himself collared and hisaccomplices nabbed. What a shock! What a bolt from the blue! Thirtyminutes and not a minute more. In thirty minutes from now, you’llhave to clear out, scud away like a hare and beat a disorderedretreat. Ha, ha, ha, what fun! I say, Polonius, you really areunlucky, each time you come up against Bibi Daubrecq! For it wasyou who were hiding behind that curtain, wasn’t it, my ill-starredPolonius?”Lupin did not stir a muscle. The one and only solution that wouldhave calmed his feelings, that is to say, for him to throttlehis adversary then and there, was so absurd that he preferred toaccept Daubrecq’s gibes without attempting to retort, though eachof them cut him like the lash of a whip. It was the second time,in the same room and in similar circumstances, that he had to bowbefore that Daubrecq of misfortune and maintain the most ridiculousattitude in silence. And he felt convinced in his innermost beingthat, if he opened his mouth, it would be to spit words of angerand insult in his victor’s face. What was the good? Was it notessential that he should keep cool and do the things which the newsituation called for?“Well, M. Lupin, well?” resumed the deputy. “You look as if yournose were out of joint. Come, console yourself and admit thatone sometimes comes across a joker who’s not quite such a mug ashis fellows. So you thought that, because I wear spectacles andeye-glasses, I was blind? Bless my soul, I don’t say that I at oncesuspected Lupin behind Polonius and Polonius behind the gentlemanwho came and bored me in the box at the Vaudeville. No, no! But,all the same, it worried me. I could see that, between the policeand Mme. Mergy, there was a third bounder trying to get a fingerin the pie. And, gradually, what with the words let fall by theportress, what with watching the movements of my cook and makinginquiries about her in the proper quarter, I began to understand.Then, the other night, came the lightning-flash. I heard the row inthe house, in spite of my being asleep. I managed to reconstructthe incident, to follow up Mme. Mergy’s traces, first, to the RueChateaubriand and, afterward, to Saint-Germain.... And then . . .what then? I put different facts together: the Enghien burglary....Gilbert’s arrest . . . the inevitable treaty of alliance betweenthe weeping mother and the leader of the gang... the old nurseinstalled as cook . . . all these people entering my house throughthe doors or through the windows.... And I knew what I had todo. Master Lupin was sniffing at the secret. The scent of theTwenty-seven attracted him. I had only to wait for his visit. Thehour has arrived. Good-evening, Master Lupin.”Daubrecq paused. He had delivered his speech with the evidentsatisfaction of a man entitled to claim the appreciation of themost captious critics.As Lupin did not speak, he took out his watch: “I say! Onlytwenty-three minutes! How time flies! At this rate, we sha’n’t havetime to come to an explanation.” And, stepping still closer toLupin, “I’m bound to say, I’m disappointed. I thought that Lupinwas a different sort of gentleman. So, the moment he meets a moreor less serious adversary, the colossus falls to pieces? Poor youngman! Have a glass of water, to bring you round!” Lupin did notutter a word, did not betray a gesture of irritation. With absolutecomposure, with a precision of movement that showed his perfectself-control and the clear plan of conduct which he had adopted, hegently pushed Daubrecq aside, went to the table and, in his turn,took down the receiver of the telephone:“I want 565.34, please,” he said.He waited until he was through; and then, speaking in a slow voiceand picking out every syllable, he said:“Hullo!.... Rue Chateaubriand?... Is that you, Achille?... Yes,it’s the governor. Listen to me carefully, Achille.... You mustleave the flat! Hullo!... Yes, at once. The police are coming ina few minutes. No, no, don’t lose your head.... You’ve got time.Only, do what I tell you. Is your bag still packed?... Good. Andis one of the sides empty, as I told you?... Good. Well, go to mybedroom and stand with your face to the chimney-piece. Press withyour left hand on the little carved rosette in front of the marbleslab, in the middle, and with your right hand on the top of themantel-shelf. You’ll see a sort of drawer, with two little boxesin it. Be careful. One of them contains all our papers; the other,bank-notes and jewellery. Put them both in the empty compartmentof the bag. Take the bag in your hand and go as fast as you can,on foot, to the corner of the Avenue Victor-Hugo and the Avenue deMontespan. You’ll find the car waiting, with Victoire. I’ll joinyou there.... What?... My clothes? My knick-knacks?... Never mindabout all that.... You be off. See you presently.”Lupin quietly pushed away the telephone. Then, taking Daubrecq bythe arm, he made him sit in a chair by his side and said:“And now listen to me, Daubrecq.”“Oho!” grinned the deputy. “Calling each other by our surnames, arewe?”“Yes,” said Lupin, “I allowed you to.” And, when Daubrecq releasedhis arm with a certain misgiving, he said, “No, don’t be afraid. Wesha’n’t come to blows. Neither of us has anything to gain by doingaway with the other. A stab with a knife? What’s the good? No, sir!Words, nothing but words. Words that strike home, though. Here aremine: they are plain and to the point. Answer me in the same way,without reflecting: that’s far better. The boy?”“I have him.”“Give him back.”“No.”“Mme. Mergy will kill herself.”“No, she won’t.”“I tell you she will.”“And I tell you she will not.”“But she’s tried to, once.”“That’s just the reason why she won’t try again.”“Well, then....”“No.”Lupin, after a moment, went on:“I expected that. Also, I thought, on my way here, that you wouldhardly tumble to the story of Dr. Vernes and that I should have touse other methods.”“Lupin’s methods.”“As you say. I had made up my mind to throw off the mask. Youpulled it off for me. Well done you! But that doesn’t change myplans.”“Speak.”Lupin took from a pocketbook a double sheet of foolscap paper,unfolded it and handed it to Daubrecq, saying:“Here is an exact, detailed inventory, with consecutive numbers,of the things removed by my friends and myself from your VillaMarie-Thérèse on the Lac d’Enghien. As you see, there are onehundred and thirteen items. Of those one hundred and thirteenitems, sixty-eight, which have a red cross against them, have beensold and sent to America. The remainder, numbering forty-five, arein my possession . . . until further orders. They happen to be thepick of the bunch. I offer you them in return for the immediatesurrender of the child.”Daubrecq could not suppress a movement of surprise:“Oho!” he said. “You seem very much bent upon it.”“Infinitely,” said Lupin, “for I am persuaded that a longerseparation from her son will mean death to Mme. Mergy.”“And that upsets you, does it . . . Lothario?”“What!”Lupin planted himself in front of the other and repeated:“What! What do you mean?”“Nothing.... Nothing.... Something that crossed my mind....Clarisse Mergy is a young woman still and a pretty woman at that.”Lupin shrugged his shoulders:“You brute!” he mumbled. “You imagine that everybody is likeyourself, heartless and pitiless. It takes your breath away, what,to think that a shark like me can waste his time playing the DonQuixote? And you wonder what dirty motive I can have? Don’t tryto find out: it’s beyond your powers of perception. Answer me,instead: do you accept?”“So you’re serious?” asked Daubrecq, who seemed but littledisturbed by Lupin’s contemptuous tone.“Absolutely. The forty-five pieces are in a shed, of which I willgive you the address, and they will be handed over to you, if youcall there, at nine o’clock this evening, with the child.”There was no doubt about Daubrecq’s reply. To him, the kidnappingof little Jacques had represented only a means of working uponClarisse Mergy’s feelings and perhaps also a warning for her tocease the contest upon which she had engaged. But the threat of asuicide must needs show Daubrecq that he was on the wrong track.That being so, why refuse the favourable bargain which Arsène Lupinwas now offering him?“I accept,” he said.“Here’s the address of my shed: 99, Rue Charles-Lafitte, Neuilly.You have only to ring the bell.”“And suppose I send Prasville, the secretary-general, instead?”“If you send Prasville,” Lupin declared, “the place is so arrangedthat I shall see him coming and that I shall have time to escape,after setting fire to the trusses of hay and straw which surroundand conceal your credence-tables, clocks and Gothic virgins.”“But your shed will be burnt down....”“I don’t mind that: the police have their eye on it already. I amleaving it in any case.”“And how am I to know that this is not a trap?”“Begin by receiving the goods and don’t give up the child tillafterward. I trust you, you see.”“Good,” said Daubrecq; “you’ve foreseen everything. Very well, youshall have the nipper; the fair Clarisse shall live; and we willall be happy. And now, if I may give you a word of advice, it is topack off as fast as you can.”“Not yet.”“Eh?”“I said, not yet.”“But you’re mad! Prasville’s on his way!”“He can wait. I’ve not done.”“Why, what more do you want? Clarisse shall have her brat. Isn’tthat enough for you?”“No.”“Why not?”“There is another son.”“Gilbert.”“Yes.”“Well?”“I want you to save Gilbert.”“What are you saying? I save Gilbert!”“You can, if you like; it only means taking a little trouble.”Until that moment Daubrecq had remained quite calm. He now suddenlyblazed out and, striking the table with his fist:“No,” he cried, “not that! Never! Don’t reckon on me!... No, thatwould be too idiotic!”He walked up and down, in a state of intense excitement, with thatqueer step of his, which swayed him from right to left on each ofhis legs, like a wild beast, a heavy, clumsy bear. And, with ahoarse voice and distorted features, he shouted:“Let her come here! Let her come and beg for her son’s pardon!But let her come unarmed, not with criminal intentions, likelast time! Let her come as a supplicant, as a tamed woman, as asubmissive woman, who understands and accepts the situation . . .Gilbert? Gilbert’s sentence? The scaffold? Why, that is where mystrength lies! What! For more than twenty years have I awaited myhour; and, when that hour strikes, when fortune brings me thisunhoped-for chance, when I am at last about to know the joy of afull revenge--and such a revenge!--you think that I will give itup, give up the thing which I have been pursuing for twenty years?I save Gilbert? I? For nothing? For love? I, Daubrecq?... No, no,you can’t have studied my features!”He laughed, with a fierce and hateful laugh. Visibly, he saw beforehim, within reach of his hand, the prey which he had been huntingdown so long. And Lupin also summoned up the vision of Clarisse,as he had seen her several days before, fainting, already beaten,fatally conquered, because all the hostile powers were in leagueagainst her.He contained himself and said:“Listen to me.”And, when Daubrecq moved away impatiently, he took him by the twoshoulders, with that superhuman strength which Daubrecq knew, fromhaving felt it in the box at the Vaudeville, and, holding himmotionless in his grip, he said:“One last word.”“You’re wasting your breath,” growled the deputy.“One last word. Listen, Daubrecq: forget Mme. Mergy, give up allthe nonsensical and imprudent acts which your pride and yourpassions are making you commit; put all that on one side and thinkonly of your interest....”“My interest,” said Daubrecq, jestingly, “always coincides with mypride and with what you call my passions.”“Up to the present, perhaps. But not now, not now that I have takena hand in the business. That constitutes a new factor, which youchoose to ignore. You are wrong. Gilbert is my pal. Gilbert is mychum. Gilbert has to be saved from the scaffold. Use your influenceto that end, and I swear to you, do you hear, I swear that we willleave you in peace. Gilbert’s safety, that’s all I ask. You willhave no more battles to wage with Mme. Mergy, with me; there willbe no more traps laid for you. You will be the master, free to actas you please. Gilbert’s safety, Daubrecq! If you refuse....”“What then?”“If you refuse, it will be war, relentless war; in other words, acertain defeat for you.”“Meaning thereby....”“Meaning thereby that I shall take the list of the Twenty-sevenfrom you.”“Rot! You think so, do you?”“I swear it.”“What Prasville and all his men, what Clarisse Mergy, what nobodyhas been able to do, you think that you will do!”“I shall!”“And why? By favour of what saint will you succeed where everybodyelse has failed? There must be a reason?”“There is.”“What is it?”“My name is Arsène Lupin.”He had let go of Daubrecq, but held him for a time under thedominion of his authoritative glance and will. At last, Daubrecqdrew himself up, gave him a couple of sharp taps on the shoulderand, with the same calm, the same intense obstinacy, said:“And my name’s Daubrecq. My whole life has been one desperatebattle, one long series of catastrophes and routs in which I spentall my energies until victory came: complete, decisive, crushing,irrevocable victory. I have against me the police, the government,France, the world. What difference do you expect it to make tome if I have M. Arsène Lupin against me into the bargain? I willgo further: the more numerous and skilful my enemies, the morecautiously I am obliged to play. And that is why, my dear sir,instead of having you arrested, as I might have done--yes, as Imight have done and very easily--I let you remain at large and begcharitably to remind you that you must quit in less than threeminutes.”“Then the answer is no?”“The answer is no.”“You won’t do anything for Gilbert?”“Yes, I shall continue to do what I have been doing since hisarrest--that is to say, to exercise indirect influence with theminister of justice, so that the trial may be hurried on and end inthe way in which I want to see it end.”“What!” cried Lupin, beside himself with indignation. “It’s becauseof you, it’s for you....”“Yes, it’s for me, Daubrecq; yes, by Jove! I have a trump card,the son’s head, and I am playing it. When I have procured anice little death-sentence for Gilbert, when the days go byand Gilbert’s petition for a reprieve is rejected by my goodoffices, you shall see, M. Lupin, that his mummy will drop all herobjections to calling herself Mme. Alexis Daubrecq and giving me anunexceptionable pledge of her good-will. That fortunate issue isinevitable, whether you like it or not. It is foredoomed. All I cando for you is to invite you to the wedding and the breakfast. Doesthat suit you? No? You persist in your sinister designs? Well, goodluck, lay your traps, spread your nets, rub up your weapons andgrind away at the Complete Foreign-post-paper Burglar’s Handbook.You’ll need it. And now, good-night. The rules of open-handed anddisinterested hospitality demand that I should turn you out ofdoors. Hop it!”Lupin remained silent for some time. With his eyes fixed onDaubrecq, he seemed to be taking his adversary’s size, gauging hisweight, estimating his physical strength, discussing, in fine, inwhich exact part to attack him. Daubrecq clenched his fists andworked out his plan of defence to meet the attack when it came.Half a minute passed. Lupin put his hand to his hip-pocket.Daubrecq did the same and grasped the handle of his revolver.A few seconds more. Coolly, Lupin produced a little gold box of thekind that ladies use for holding sweets, opened it and handed it toDaubrecq:“A lozenge?”“What’s that?” asked the other, in surprise.“Cough-drops.”“What for?”“For the draught you’re going to feel!”And, taking advantage of the momentary fluster into which Daubrecqwas thrown by his sally, he quickly took his hat and slipped away.“Of course,” he said, as he crossed the hall, “I am knocked intofits. But all the same, that bit of commercial-traveller’s waggerywas rather novel, in the circumstances. To expect a pill andreceive a cough-drop is by way of being a sort of disappointment.It left the old chimpanzee quite flummoxed.”As he closed the gate, a motor-car drove up and a man sprang outbriskly, followed by several others.Lupin recognized Prasville:“Monsieur le secrétaire;-général,” he muttered, “your humbleservant. I have an idea that, some day, fate will bring us faceto face: and I am sorry, for your sake; for you do not inspire mewith any particular esteem and you have a bad time before you, onthat day. Meanwhile, if I were not in such a hurry, I should waittill you leave and I should follow Daubrecq to find out in whosecharge he has placed the child whom he is going to hand back to me.But I am in a hurry. Besides, I can’t tell that Daubrecq won’t actby telephone. So let us not waste ourselves in vain efforts, butrather join Victoire, Achille and our precious bag.”Two hours later, Lupin, after taking all his measures, was on thelookout in his shed at Neuilly and saw Daubrecq turn out of anadjoining street and walk along with a distrustful air.Lupin himself opened the double doors:“Your things are in here, monsieur le député,” he said. “You can goround and look. There is a job-master’s yard next door: you haveonly to ask for a van and a few men. Where is the child?”Daubrecq first inspected the articles and then took Lupin to theAvenue de Neuilly, where two closely veiled old ladies stoodwaiting with little Jacques.Lupin carried the child to his car, where Victoire was waiting forhim.All this was done swiftly, without useless words and as though theparts had been got by heart and the various movements settled inadvance, like so many stage entrances and exits.At ten o’clock in the evening Lupin kept his promise and handedlittle Jacques to his mother. But the doctor had to be hurriedlycalled in, for the child, upset by all those happenings, showedgreat signs of excitement and terror. It was more than a fortnightbefore he was sufficiently recovered to bear the strain of theremoval which Lupin considered necessary. Mme. Mergy herself wasonly just fit to travel when the time came. The journey took placeat night, with every possible precaution and under Lupin’s escort.He took the mother and son to a little seaside place in Brittanyand entrusted them to Victoire’s care and vigilance.“At last,” he reflected, when he had seen them settled, “thereis no one between the Daubrecq bird and me. He can do nothingmore to Mme. Mergy and the kid; and she no longer runs the riskof diverting the struggle through her intervention. By Jingo, wehave made blunders enough! First, I have had to disclose myself toDaubrecq. Secondly, I have had to surrender my share of the Enghienmovables. True, I shall get those back, sooner or later; of thatthere is not the least doubt. But, all the same, we are not gettingon; and, in a week from now, Gilbert and Vaucheray will be up fortrial.”What Lupin felt most in the whole business was Daubrecq’srevelation of the whereabouts of the flat. The police had enteredhis place in the Rue Chateaubriand. The identity of Lupin andMichel Beaumont had been recognized and certain papers discovered;and Lupin, while pursuing his aim, while, at the same time,managing various enterprises on which he had embarked, whileavoiding the searches of the police, which were becoming morezealous and persistent than ever, had to set to work and reorganizehis affairs throughout on a fresh basis.His rage with Daubrecq, therefore, increased in proportion to theworry which the deputy caused him. He had but one longing, topocket him, as he put it, to have him at his bidding by fair meansor foul, to extract his secret from him. He dreamt of torturesfit to unloose the tongue of the most silent of men. The boot,the rack, red-hot pincers, nailed planks: no form of suffering,he thought, was more than the enemy deserved; and the end to beattained justified every means.“Oh,” he said to himself, “oh, for a decent bench of inquisitorsand a couple of bold executioners!... What a time we should have!”Every afternoon the Growler and the Masher watched the road whichDaubrecq took between the Square Lamartine, the Chamber of Deputiesand his club. Their instructions were to choose the most desertedstreet and the most favourable moment and, one evening, to hustlehim into a motor-car.Lupin, on his side, got ready an old building, standing in themiddle of a large garden, not far from Paris, which presented allthe necessary conditions of safety and isolation and which hecalled the Monkey’s Cage.Unfortunately, Daubrecq must have suspected something, for everytime, so to speak, he changed his route, or took the underground ora tram; and the cage remained unoccupied.Lupin devised another plan. He sent to Marseilles for one of hisassociates, an elderly retired grocer called Brindebois, whohappened to live in Daubrecq’s electoral district and interestedhimself in politics. Old Brindebois wrote to Daubrecq fromMarseilles, announcing his visit. Daubrecq gave this importantconstituent a hearty welcome, and a dinner was arranged for thefollowing week.The elector suggested a little restaurant on the left bank of theSeine, where the food, he said, was something wonderful. Daubrecqaccepted.This was what Lupin wanted. The proprietor of the restaurant wasone of his friends. The attempt, which was to take place on thefollowing Thursday, was this time bound to succeed.Meanwhile, on the Monday of the same week, the trial of Gilbert andVaucheray opened.       *       *       *       *       *The reader will remember--and the case took place too recently for meto recapitulate its details--the really incomprehensible partialitywhich the presiding judge showed in his cross-examination of Gilbert.The thing was noticed and severely criticised at the time. Lupinrecognized Daubrecq’s hateful influence.The attitude observed by the two prisoners differed greatly.Vaucheray was gloomy, silent, hard-faced. He cynically, in curt,sneering, almost defiant phrases, admitted the crimes of which hehad formerly been guilty. But, with an inconsistency which puzzledeverybody except Lupin, he denied any participation in the murderof Léonard the valet and violently accused Gilbert. His object, inthus linking his fate with Gilbert’s, was to force Lupin to takeidentical measures for the rescue of both his accomplices.Gilbert, on the other hand, whose frank countenance and dreamy,melancholy eyes won every sympathy, was unable to protect himselfagainst the traps laid for him by the judge or to counteractVaucheray’s lies. He burst into tears, talked too much, or else didnot talk when he should have talked. Moreover, his counsel, oneof the Leaders of the bar, was taken ill at the last moment--andhere again Lupin saw the hand of Daubrecq--and he was replaced bya junior who spoke badly, muddied the whole case, set the juryagainst him and failed to wipe out the impression produced by thespeeches of the advocate-general and of Vaucheray’s counsel.Lupin, who had the inconceivable audacity to be present on the lastday of the trial, the Thursday, had no doubt as to the result. Averdict of guilty was certain in both cases.It was certain because all the efforts of the prosecution, thussupporting Vaucheray’s tactics, had tended to link the twoprisoners closely together. It was certain, also and above all,because it concerned two of Lupin’s accomplices. From the openingof the inquiry before the magistrate until the delivery of theverdict, all the proceedings had been directed against Lupin;and this in spite of the fact that the prosecution, for want ofsufficient evidence and also in order not to scatter its effortsover too wide an area, had decided not to include Lupin in theindictment. He was the adversary aimed at, the leader who mustbe punished in the person of his friends, the famous and popularscoundrel whose fascination in the eyes of the crowd must bedestroyed for good and all. With Gilbert and Vaucheray executed,Lupin’s halo would fade away and the legend would be exploded.Lupin.... Lupin.... Arsène Lupin: it was the one name heardthroughout the four days. The advocate-general, the presidingjudge, the jury, the counsel, the witnesses had no other wordson their lips. Every moment, Lupin was mentioned and cursed at,scoffed at, insulted and held responsible for all the crimescommitted. It was as though Gilbert and Vaucheray figured only assupernumeraries, while the real criminal undergoing trial was he,Lupin, Master Lupin, Lupin the burglar, the leader of a gang ofthieves, the forger, the incendiary, the hardened offender, theex-convict, Lupin the murderer, Lupin stained with the blood of hisvictim, Lupin lurking in the shade, like a coward, after sendinghis friends to the foot of the scaffold.“Oh, the rascals know what they’re about!” he muttered. “It’s mydebt which they are making my poor old Gilbert pay.”And the terrible tragedy went on.At seven o’clock in the evening, after a long deliberation, thejury returned to court and the foreman read out the answers tothe questions put from the bench. The answer was “Yes” to everycount of the indictment, a verdict of guilty without extenuatingcircumstances.The prisoners were brought in. Standing up, but staggering andwhite-faced, they received their sentence of death.And, amid the great, solemn silence, in which the anxiety of theonlookers was mingled with pity, the assize-president asked:“Have you anything more to say, Vaucheray?”“Nothing, monsieur le president. Now that my mate is sentenced aswell as myself, I am easy.... We are both on the same footing....The governor must find a way to save the two of us.”“The governor?”“Yes, Arsène Lupin.”There was a laugh among the crowd.The president asked:“And you, Gilbert?”Tears streamed down the poor lad’s cheeks and he stammered a fewinarticulate sentences. But, when the judge repeated his question,he succeeded in mastering himself and replied, in a trembling voice:“I wish to say, monsieur le president, that I am guilty of manythings, that’s true.... I have done a lot of harm.... But, all thesame, not this. No, I have not committed murder.... I have nevercommitted murder.... And I don’t want to die.... it would be toohorrible....”He swayed from side to side, supported by the warders, and he washeard to cry, like a child calling for help:“Governor.... save me!... Save me!... I don’t want to die!”Then, in the crowd, amid the general excitement, a voice rose abovethe surrounding clamour:“Don’t be afraid, little ‘un!... The governor’s here!”A tumult and hustling followed. The municipal guards and thepolicemen rushed into court and laid hold of a big, red-faced man,who was stated by his neighbours to be the author of that outburstand who struggled hand and foot.Questioned without delay, he gave his name, Philippe Bonel, anundertaker’s man, and declared that some one sitting beside him hadoffered him a hundred-franc note if he would consent, at the propermoment, to shout a few words which his neighbour scribbled on a bitof paper. How could he refuse?In proof of his statements, he produced the hundred-franc note andthe scrap of paper.Philippe Bonel was let go.Meanwhile, Lupin, who of course had assisted energetically in theindividual’s arrest and handed him over to the guards, left thelaw-courts, his heart heavy with anguish. His car was waiting forhim on the quay. He flung himself into it, in despair, seizedwith so great a sorrow that he had to make an effort to restrainhis tears. Gilbert’s cry, his voice wrung with affliction, hisdistorted features, his tottering frame: all this haunted hisbrain; and he felt as if he would never, for a single second,forget those impressions.He drove home to the new place which he had selected among hisdifferent residences and which occupied a corner of the Place deClichy. He expected to find the Growler and the Masher, with whomhe was to kidnap Daubrecq that evening. But he had hardly openedthe door of his flat, when a cry escaped him: Clarisse stood beforehim; Clarisse, who had returned from Brittany at the moment of theverdict.[Illustration: “What we have to do is to stop the mischief andto-night, you understand, to-night the thing will be done.”]He at once gathered from her attitude and her pallor that she knew.And, at once, recovering his courage in her presence, withoutgiving her time to speak, he exclaimed:“Yes, yes, yes . . . but it doesn’t matter. We foresaw that. Wecouldn’t prevent it. What we have to do is to stop the mischief.And to-night, you understand, to-night, the thing will be done.”Motionless and tragic in her sorrow, she stammered:“To-night?”“Yes. I have prepared everything. In two hours, Daubrecq will bein my hands. To-night, whatever means I have to employ, he shallspeak.”“Do you mean that?” she asked, faintly, while a ray of hope beganto light up her face.“He shall speak. I shall have his secret. I shall tear the list ofthe Twenty-seven from him. And that list will set your son free.”“Too late,” Clarisse murmured.“Too late? Why? Do you think that, in exchange for such a document,I shall not obtain Gilbert’s pretended escape?... Why, Gilbert willbe at liberty in three days! In three days....”He was interrupted by a ring at the bell:“Listen, here are our friends. Trust me. Remember that I keep mypromises. I gave you back your little Jacques. I shall give youback Gilbert.”He went to let the Growler and the Masher in and said:“Is everything ready? Is old Brindebois at the restaurant? Quick,let us be off!”“It’s no use, governor,” replied the Masher.“No use? What do you mean?”“There’s news.”“What news? Speak, man!”“Daubrecq has disappeared.”“Eh? What’s that? Daubrecq disappeared?”“Yes, carried off from his house, in broad daylight.”“The devil! By whom?”“Nobody knows . . . four men . . . there were pistols fired.... Thepolice are on the spot. Prasville is directing the investigations.”Lupin did not move a limb. He looked at Clarisse Mergy, who layhuddled in a chair.He himself had to bow his head. Daubrecq carried off meant one morechance of success lost....']"
83,9,Chapter 9,"['VII.THE PROFILE OF NAPOLEONSoon as the prefect of police, the chief of thecriminal-investigation department and the examining-magistrates hadleft Daubrecq’s house, after a preliminary and entirely fruitlessinquiry, Prasville resumed his personal search.He was examining the study and the traces of the struggle which hadtaken place there, when the portress brought him a visiting-card,with a few words in pencil scribbled upon it.“Show the lady in,” he said.“The lady has some one with her,” said the portress.“Oh? Well, show the other person in as well.”Clarisse Mergy entered at once and introduced the gentleman withher, a gentleman in a black frock-coat, which was too tight for himand which looked as though it had not been brushed for ages. He wasshy in his manner and seemed greatly embarrassed how to disposeof his old, rusty top-hat, his gingham umbrella, his one and onlyglove and his body generally.“M. Nicole,” said Clarisse, “a private teacher, who is acting astutor to my little Jacques. M. Nicole has been of the greatesthelp to me with his advice during the past year. He worked out thewhole story of the crystal stopper. I should like him, as well asmyself--if you see no objection to telling me--to know the detailsof this kidnapping business, which alarms me and upsets my plans;yours too, I expect?”Prasville had every confidence in Clarisse Mergy. He knew herrelentless hatred of Daubrecq and appreciated the assistance whichshe had rendered in the case. He therefore made no difficultiesabout telling her what he knew, thanks to certain clues andespecially to the evidence of the portress.For that matter, the thing was exceedingly simple. Daubrecq, whohad attended the trial of Gilbert and Vaucheray as a witness andwho was seen in court during the speeches, returned home at sixo’clock. The portress affirmed that he came in alone and that therewas nobody in the house at the time. Nevertheless, a few minuteslater, she heard shouts, followed by the sound of a struggle andtwo pistol-shots; and from her lodge she saw four masked menscuttle down the front steps, carrying Daubrecq the deputy, andhurry toward the gate. They opened the gate. At the same moment,a motor-car arrived outside the house. The four men bundledthemselves into it; and the motor-car, which had hardly had time tostop, set off at full speed.“Were there not always two policemen on duty?” asked Clarisse.“They were there,” said Prasville, “but at a hundred and fiftyyards’ distance; and Daubrecq was carried off so quickly that theywere unable to interfere, although they hastened up as fast as theycould.”“And did they discover nothing, find nothing?”“Nothing, or hardly anything.... Merely this.”“What is that?”“A little piece of ivory, which they picked up on the ground. Therewas a fifth party in the car; and the portress saw him get downwhile the others were hoisting Daubrecq in. As he was steppingback into the car, he dropped something and picked it up again atonce. But the thing, whatever it was, must have been broken on thepavement; for this is the bit of ivory which my men found.”“But how did the four men manage to enter the house?” askedClarisse.“By means of false keys, evidently, while the portress was doingher shopping, in the course of the afternoon; and they had nodifficulty in secreting themselves, as Daubrecq keeps no otherservants. I have every reason to believe that they hid in theroom next door, which is the dining-room, and afterward attackedDaubrecq here, in the study. The disturbance of the furniture andother articles proves how violent the struggle was. We found alarge-bore revolver, belonging to Daubrecq, on the carpet. One ofthe bullets had smashed the glass over the mantel-piece, as yousee.”Clarisse turned to her companion for him to express an opinion. ButM. Nicole, with his eyes obstinately lowered, had not budged fromhis chair and sat fumbling at the rim of his hat, as though he hadnot yet found a proper place for it.Prasville gave a smile. It was evident that he did not look uponClarisse’s adviser as a man of first-rate intelligence:“The case is somewhat puzzling, monsieur,” he said, “is it not?”“Yes . . . yes,” M. Nicole confessed, “most puzzling.”“Then you have no little theory of your own upon the matter?”“Well, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, I’m thinking that Daubrecqhas many enemies.”“Ah, capital!”“And that several of those enemies, who are interested in hisdisappearance, must have banded themselves against him.”“Capital, capital!” said Prasville, with satirical approval.“Capital! Everything is becoming clear as daylight. It only remainsfor you to furnish us with a little suggestion that will enable usto turn our search in the right direction.”“Don’t you think, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, that this brokenbit of ivory which was picked up on the ground....”“No, M. Nicole, no. That bit of ivory belongs to something which wedo not know and which its owner will at once make it his businessto conceal. In order to trace the owner, we should at least be ableto define the nature of the thing itself.”M. Nicole reflected and then began:“Monsieur le secrétaire;-général, when Napoleon I fell frompower....”“Oh, M. Nicole, oh, a lesson in French history!”“Only a sentence, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, just onesentence which I will ask your leave to complete. When NapoleonI fell from power, the Restoration placed a certain number ofofficers on half-pay. These officers were suspected by theauthorities and kept under observation by the police. They remainedfaithful to the emperor’s memory; and they contrived to reproducethe features of their idol on all sorts of objects of everyday use;snuff-boxes, rings, breast-pins, pen-knives and so on.”“Well?”“Well, this bit comes from a walking-stick, or rather a sort ofloaded cane, or life-preserver, the knob of which is formed ofa piece of carved ivory. When you look at the knob in a certainway, you end by seeing that the outline represents the profileof the Little Corporal. What you have in your hand, monsieur lesecrétaire;-général, is a bit of the ivory knob at the top of ahalf-pay officer’s life-preserver.”“Yes,” said Prasville, examining the exhibit, “yes, I can make outa profile . . . but I don’t see the inference....”“The inference is very simple. Among Daubrecq’s victims, amongthose whose names are inscribed on the famous list, is thedescendant of a Corsican family in Napoleon’s service, whichderived its wealth and title from the emperor and was afterwardruined under the Restoration. It is ten to one that thisdescendant, who was the leader of the Bonapartist party a few yearsago, was the fifth person hiding in the motor-car. Need I state hisname?”“The Marquis d’Albufex?” said Prasville.“The Marquis d’Albufex,” said M. Nicole.M. Nicole, who no longer seemed in the least worried with his hat,his glove and his umbrella, rose and said to Prasville:“Monsieur le secrétaire;-général, I might have kept my discoveryto myself, and not told you of it until after the final victory,that is, after bringing you the list of the Twenty-seven. Butmatters are urgent. Daubrecq’s disappearance, contrary to whathis kidnappers expect, may hasten on the catastrophe which youwish to avert. We must therefore act with all speed. Monsieurle secrétaire;-général, I ask for your immediate and practicalassistance.”“In what way can I help you?” asked Prasville, who was beginning tobe impressed by his quaint visitor.“By giving me, to-morrow, those particulars about the Marquisd’Albufex which it would take me personally several days tocollect.”Prasville seemed to hesitate and turned his head toward Mme. Mergy.Clarisse said:“I beg of you to accept M. Nicole’s services. He is an invaluableand devoted ally. I will answer for him as I would for myself.”“What particulars do you require, monsieur?” asked Prasville.“Everything that concerns the Marquis d’Albufex: the positionof his family, the way in which he spends his time, his familyconnections, the properties which he owns in Paris and in thecountry.”Prasville objected:“After all, whether it’s the marquis or another, Daubrecq’skidnapper is working on our behalf, seeing that, by capturing thelist, he disarms Daubrecq.”“And who says, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, that he is notworking on his own behalf?”“That is not possible, as his name is on the list.”“And suppose he erases it? Suppose you then find yourself dealingwith a second blackmailer, even more grasping and more powerfulthan the first and one who, as a political adversary, is in abetter position than Daubrecq to maintain the contest?”The secretary-general was struck by the argument. After a moment’sthought, he said:“Come and see me in my office at four o’clock to-morrow. I willgive you the particulars. What is your address, in case I shouldwant you?”“M. Nicole, 25, Place de Clichy. I am staying at a friend’s flat,which he has lent me during his absence.”The interview was at an end. M. Nicole thanked thesecretary-general, with a very low bow, and walked out, accompaniedby Mme. Mergy:“That’s an excellent piece of work,” he said, outside, rubbing hishands. “I can march into the police-office whenever I like, and setthe whole lot to work.”Mme. Mergy, who was less hopefully inclined, said:“Alas, will you be in time? What terrifies me is the thought thatthe list may be destroyed.”“Goodness gracious me, by whom? By Daubrecq?”“No, but by the marquis, when he gets hold of it.”“He hasn’t got it yet! Daubrecq will resist long enough, at anyrate, for us to reach him. Just think! Prasville is at my orders!”“Suppose he discovers who you are? The least inquiry will provethat there is no such person as M. Nicole.”“But it will not prove that M. Nicole is the same person as ArsèneLupin. Besides, make yourself easy. Prasville is not only beneathcontempt as a detective: he has but one aim in life, which is todestroy his old enemy, Daubrecq. To achieve that aim, all means areequally good; and he will not waste time in verifying the identityof a M. Nicole who promises him Daubrecq. Not to mention that Iwas brought by you and that, when all is said, my little gifts diddazzle him to some extent. So let us go ahead boldly.”Clarisse always recovered confidence in Lupin’s presence. Thefuture seemed less appalling to her; and she admitted, she forcedherself to admit, that the chances of saving Gilbert were notlessened by that hideous death-sentence. But he could not prevailupon her to return to Brittany. She wanted to fight by his side.She wanted to be there and share all his hopes and all hisdisappointments.The next day the inquiries of the police confirmed what Prasvilleand Lupin already knew. The Marquis d’Albufex had been very deeplyinvolved in the business of the canal, so deeply that PrinceNapoleon was obliged to remove him from the management of hispolitical campaign in France; and he kept up his very extravagantstyle of living only by dint of constant loans and makeshifts. Onthe other hand, in so far as concerned the kidnapping of Daubrecq,it was ascertained that, contrary to his usual custom, the marquishad not appeared in his club between six and seven that evening andhad not dined at home. He did not come back until midnight; andthen he came on foot.M. Nicole’s accusation, therefore, was receiving an early proof.Unfortunately--and Lupin was no more successful in his ownattempts--it was impossible to obtain the least clue as to themotor-car, the chauffeur and the four people who had enteredDaubrecq’s house. Were they associates of the marquis, compromisedin the canal affair like himself? Were they men in his pay? Nobodyknew.The whole search, consequently, had to be concentrated upon themarquis and the country-seats and houses which he might possess ata certain distance from Paris, a distance which, allowing for theaverage speed of a motor-car and the inevitable stoppages, could beput at sixty to ninety miles.Now d’Albufex, having sold everything that he ever had, possessedneither country-houses nor landed estates.They turned their attention to the marquis’ relations and intimatefriends. Was he able on this side to dispose of some safe retreatin which to imprison Daubrecq?The result was equally fruitless.And the days passed. And what days for Clarisse Mergy! Each of thembrought Gilbert nearer to the terrible day of reckoning. Each ofthem meant twenty-four hours less from the date which Clarisse hadinstinctively fixed in her mind. And she said to Lupin, who wasracked with the same anxiety:“Fifty-five days more.... Fifty days more.... What can one do in sofew days?... Oh, I beg of you.... I beg of you....”What could they do indeed? Lupin, who would not leave the task ofwatching the marquis to any one but himself, practically livedwithout sleeping. But the marquis had resumed his regular life;and, doubtless suspecting something, did not risk going away.Once alone, he went down to the Duc de Montmaur’s, in the daytime.The duke kept a pack of boar-hounds, with which he hunted theForest of Durlaine. D’Albufex maintained no relations with himoutside the hunt.“It is hardly likely,” said Prasville, “that the Duc de Montmaur,an exceedingly wealthy man, who is interested only in his estatesand his hunting and takes no part in politics, should lend himselfto the illegal detention of Daubrecq the deputy in his chateau.”Lupin agreed; but, as he did not wish to leave anything to chance,the next week, seeing d’Albufex go out one morning in riding-dress,he followed him to the Gare du Nord and took the same train.He got out at Aumale, where d’Albufex found a carriage at thestation which took him to the Chateau de Montmaur.Lupin lunched quietly, hired a bicycle and came in view of thehouse at the moment when the guests were going into the park,in motor-cars or mounted. The Marquis d’Albufex was one of thehorsemen.Thrice, in the course of the day, Lupin saw him cantering along.And he found him, in the evening, at the station, where d’Albufexrode up, followed by a huntsman.The proof, therefore, was conclusive; and there was nothingsuspicious on that side. Why did Lupin, nevertheless, resolve notto be satisfied with appearances? And why, next day, did he sendthe Masher to find out things in the neighbourhood of Montmaur? Itwas an additional precaution, based upon no logical reason, butagreeing with his methodical and careful manner of acting.Two days later he received from the Masher, among other informationof less importance, a list of the house-party at Montmaur and ofall the servants and keepers.One name struck him, among those of the huntsmen. He at once wired:    “Inquire about huntsman Sébastiani.”The Masher’s answer was received the next day:    “Sébastiani, a Corsican, was recommended to the Duc de    Montmaur by the Marquis d’Albufex. He lives at two or three    miles from the house, in a hunting-lodge built among the    ruins of the feudal stronghold which was the cradle of the    Montmaur family.”“That’s it,” said Lupin to Clarisse Mergy, showing her the Masher’sletter. “That name, Sébastiani, at once reminded me that d’Albufexis of Corsican descent. There was a connection....”“Then what do you intend to do?”“If Daubrecq is imprisoned in those ruins, I intend to enter intocommunication with him.”“He will distrust you.”“No. Lately, acting on the information of the police, I ended bydiscovering the two old ladies who carried off your little Jacquesat Saint-Germain and who brought him, the same evening, to Neuilly.They are two old maids, cousins of Daubrecq, who makes them asmall monthly allowance. I have been to call on those DemoisellesRousselot; remember the name and the address: 134 bis, Rue du Bac.I inspired them with confidence, promised them to find their cousinand benefactor; and the elder sister, Euphrasie Rousselot, gave mea letter in which she begs Daubrecq to trust M. Nicole entirely. Soyou see, I have taken every precaution. I shall leave to-night.”“We, you mean,” said Clarisse.“You!”“Can I go on living like this, in feverish inaction?” And shewhispered, “I am no longer counting the days, the thirty-eight orforty days that remain to us: I am counting the hours.”Lupin felt that her resolution was too strong for him to try tocombat it. They both started at five o’clock in the morning, bymotor-car. The Growler went with them.So as not to arouse suspicion, Lupin chose a large town as hisheadquarters. At Amiens, where he installed Clarisse, he was onlyeighteen miles from Montmaur.At eight o’clock he met the Masher not far from the old fortress,which was known in the neighbourhood by the name of Mortepierre,and he examined the locality under his guidance.On the confines of the forest, the little river Ligier, whichhas dug itself a deep valley at this spot, forms a loop which isoverhung by the enormous cliff of Mortepierre.“Nothing to be done on this side,” said Lupin. “The cliff is steep,over two hundred feet high, and the river hugs it all round.”Not far away they found a bridge that led to the foot of a pathwhich wound, through the oaks and pines, up to a little esplanade,where stood a massive, iron-bound gate, studded with nails andflanked on either side by a large tower.“Is this where Sébastiani the huntsman lives?” asked Lupin.“Yes,” said the Masher, “with his wife, in a lodge standing in themidst of the ruins. I also learnt that he has three tall sons andthat all the four were supposed to be away for a holiday on the daywhen Daubrecq was carried off.”“Oho!” said Lupin. “The coincidence is worth remembering. It seemslikely enough that the business was done by those chaps and theirfather.”Toward the end of the afternoon Lupin availed himself of a breachto the right of the towers to scale the curtain. From there he wasable to see the huntsman’s lodge and the few remains of the oldfortress: here, a bit of wall, suggesting the mantel of a chimney;further away, a water-tank; on this side, the arches of a chapel;on the other, a heap of fallen stones.A patrol-path edged the cliff in front; and, at one of the endsof this patrol-path, there were the remains of a formidabledonjon-keep razed almost level with the ground.Lupin returned to Clarisse Mergy in the evening. And from thattime he went backward and forward between Amiens and Mortepierre,leaving the Growler and the Masher permanently on the watch.And six days passed. Sébastiani’s habits seemed to be subjectsolely to the duties of his post. He used to go up to the Chateaude Montmaur, walk about in the forest, note the tracks of the gameand go his rounds at night.But, on the seventh day, learning that there was to be a meet andthat a carriage had been sent to Aumale Station in the morning,Lupin took up his post in a cluster of box and laurels whichsurrounded the little esplanade in front of the gate.At two o’clock he heard the pack give tongue. They approached,accompanied by hunting-cries, and then drew farther away. Heheard them again, about the middle of the afternoon, not quite sodistinctly; and that was all. But suddenly, amid the silence, thesound of galloping horses reached his ears; and, a few minuteslater, he saw two riders climbing the river-path.He recognized the Marquis d’Albufex and Sébastiani. On reaching theesplanade, they both alighted; and a woman--the huntsman’s wife, nodoubt--opened the gate. Sébastiani fastened the horses’ bridles torings fixed on a post at a few yards from Lupin and ran to join themarquis. The gate closed behind them.Lupin did not hesitate; and, though it was still broad daylight,relying upon the solitude of the place, he hoisted himself to thehollow of the breach. Passing his head through cautiously, he sawthe two men and Sébastiani’s wife hurrying toward the ruins of thekeep.The huntsman drew aside a hanging screen of ivy and revealed theentrance to a stairway, which he went down, as did d’Albufex,leaving his wife on guard on the terrace.There was no question of going in after them; and Lupin returned tohis hiding-place. He did not wait long before the gate opened again.The Marquis d’Albufex seemed in a great rage. He was striking theleg of his boot with his whip and mumbling angry words which Lupinwas able to distinguish when the distance became less great:“Ah, the hound!... I’ll make him speak.... I’ll come back to-night. . . to-night, at ten o’clock, do you hear, Sébastiani?... And weshall do what’s necessary.... Oh, the brute!”Sébastiani unfastened the horses. D’Albufex turned to the woman:“See that your sons keep a good watch.... If any one attempts todeliver him, so much the worse for him. The trapdoor is there. CanI rely upon them?”“As thoroughly as on myself, monsieur le marquis,” declared thehuntsman. “They know what monsieur le marquis has done for me andwhat he means to do for them. They will shrink at nothing.”“Let us mount and get back to the hounds,” said d’Albufex.So things were going as Lupin had supposed. During these runs,d’Albufex, taking a line of his own, would push off to Mortepierre,without anybody’s suspecting his trick. Sébastiani, who was devotedto him body and soul, for reasons connected with the past intowhich it was not worth while to inquire, accompanied him; andtogether they went to see the captive, who was closely watched bythe huntsman’s wife and his three sons.“That’s where we stand,” said Lupin to Clarisse Mergy, when hejoined her at a neighbouring inn. “This evening the marquiswill put Daubrecq to the question--a little brutally, butindispensably--as I intended to do myself.”“And Daubrecq will give up his secret,” said Clarisse, alreadyquite upset.“I’m afraid so.”“Then....”“I am hesitating between two plans,” said Lupin, who seemed verycalm. “Either to prevent the interview....”“How?”“By forestalling d’Albufex. At nine o’clock, the Growler, theMasher and I climb the ramparts, burst into the fortress, attackthe keep, disarm the garrison . . . and the thing’s done: Daubrecqis ours.”“Unless Sébastiani’s sons fling him through the trapdoor to whichthe marquis alluded....”“For that reason,” said Lupin, “I intend to risk that violentmeasure only as a last resort and in case my other plan should notbe practicable.”“What is the other plan?”“To witness the interview. If Daubrecq does not speak, it willgive us the time to prepare to carry him off under more favourableconditions. If he speaks, if they compel him to reveal the placewhere the list of the Twenty-seven is hidden, I shall know thetruth at the same time as d’Albufex, and I swear to God that Ishall turn it to account before he does.”“Yes, yes,” said Clarisse. “But how do you propose to be present?”“I don’t know yet,” Lupin confessed. “It depends on certainparticulars which the Masher is to bring me and on some which Ishall find out for myself.”He left the inn and did not return until an hour later as night wasfalling. The Masher joined him.“Have you the little book?” asked Lupin.“Yes, governor. It was what I saw at the Aumale newspaper-shop. Igot it for ten sous.”“Give it me.”The Masher handed him an old, soiled, torn pamphlet, entitled,on the cover, _A Visit to Mortepierre, 1824, with plans andillustrations_.Lupin at once looked for the plan of the donjon-keep.“That’s it,” he said. “Above the ground were three stories, whichhave been razed, and below the ground, dug out of the rock, twostories, one of which was blocked up by the rubbish, while theother.... There, that’s where our friend Daubrecq lies. The name issignificant: the torture-chamber.... Poor, dear friend!... Betweenthe staircase and the torture-chamber, two doors. Between those twodoors, a recess in which the three brothers obviously sit, gun inhand.”“So it is impossible for you to get in that way without being seen.”“Impossible . . . unless I come from above, by the story that hasfallen in, and look for a means of entrance through the ceiling....But that is very risky....”He continued to turn the pages of the book. Clarisse asked:“Is there no window to the room?”“Yes,” he said. “From below, from the river--I have just beenthere--you can see a little opening, which is also marked on theplan. But it is fifty yards up, sheer; and even then the rockoverhangs the water. So that again is out of the question.”He glanced through a few pages of the book. The title of onechapter struck him: _The Lovers’ Towers_. He read the opening lines:    “In the old days, the donjon was known to the people of the    neighbourhood as the Lovers’ Tower, in memory of a fatal    tragedy that marked it in the Middle Ages. The Comte de    Mortepierre, having received proofs of his wife’s faithlessness,    imprisoned her in the torture-chamber, where she spent twenty    years. One night, her lover, the Sire de Tancarville, with    reckless courage, set up a ladder in the river and then    clambered up the face of the cliff till he came to the window    of the room. After filing the bars, he succeeded in releasing    the woman he loved and bringing her down with him by means of a    rope. They both reached the top of the ladder, which was watched    by his friends, when a shot was fired from the patrol-path and    hit the man in the shoulder. The two lovers were hurled into    space....”There was a pause, after he had read this, a long pause duringwhich each of them drew a mental picture of the tragic escape.So, three or four centuries earlier, a man, risking his life, hadattempted that surprising feat and would have succeeded but for thevigilance of some sentry who heard the noise. A man had ventured! Aman had dared! A man done it!Lupin raised his eyes to Clarisse. She was looking at him . . .with such a desperate, such a beseeching look! The look of a motherwho demanded the impossible and who would have sacrificed anythingto save her son.“Masher,” he said, “get a strong rope, but very slender, so that Ican roll it round my waist, and very long: fifty or sixty yards.You, Growler, go and look for three or four ladders and fasten themend to end.”“Why, what are you thinking of, governor?” cried the twoaccomplices. “What, you mean to.... But it’s madness!”“Madness? Why? What another has done I can do.”“But it’s a hundred chances to one that you break your neck.”“Well, you see, Masher, there’s one chance that I don’t.”“But, governor....”“That’s enough, my friends. Meet me in an hour on the river-bank.”       *       *       *       *       *The preparations took long in the making. It was difficult to findthe material for a fifty-foot ladder that would reach the firstledge of the cliff; and it required an endless effort and care tojoin the different sections.At last, a little after nine o’clock, it was set up in the middleof the river and held in position by a boat, the bows of which werewedged between two of the rungs, while the stern was rammed intothe bank.The road through the river-valley was little used, and nobody cameto interrupt the work. The night was dark, the sky heavy withmoveless clouds.Lupin gave the Masher and the Growler their final instructions andsaid, with a laugh:“I can’t tell you how amused I am at the thought of seeingDaubrecq’s face when they proceed to take his scalp or slice hisskin into ribbons. Upon my word, it’s worth the journey.”Clarisse also had taken a seat in the boat. He said to her:“Until we meet again. And, above all, don’t stir. Whatever happens,not a movement, not a cry.”“Can anything happen?” she asked.“Why, remember the Sire de Tancarville! It was at the very momentwhen he was achieving his object, with his true love in his arms,that an accident betrayed him. But be easy: I shall be all right.”She made no reply. She seized his hand and grasped it warmlybetween her own.He put his foot on the ladder and made sure that it did not swaytoo much. Then he went up.He soon reached the top rung.This was where the dangerous ascent began, a difficult ascent atthe start, because of the excessive steepness, and developing,mid-way, into an absolute escalade.Fortunately, here and there were little hollows, in which his feetfound a resting-place, and projecting stones, to which his handsclung. But twice those stones gave way and he slipped; and twicehe firmly believed that all was lost. Finding a deeper hollow, hetook a rest. He was worn out, felt quite ready to throw up theenterprise, asked himself if it was really worth while for him toexpose himself to such danger:“I say!” he thought. “Seems to me you’re showing the white feather,Lupin, old boy. Throw up the enterprise? Then Daubrecq will babblehis secret, the marquis will possess himself of the list, Lupinwill return empty-handed, and Gilbert....”The long rope which he had fastened round his waist caused himneedless inconvenience and fatigue. He fixed one of the ends to thestrap of his trousers and let the rope uncoil all the way down theascent, so that he could use it, on returning, as a hand-rail.Then he once more clutched at the rough surface of the cliff andcontinued the climb, with bruised nails and bleeding fingers. Atevery moment he expected the inevitable fall. And what discouragedhim most was to hear the murmur of voices rising from the boat,murmur so distinct that it seemed as though he were not increasingthe distance between his companions and himself.And he remembered the Sire de Tancarville, alone, he too, amid thedarkness, who must have shivered at the noise of the stones whichhe loosened and sent bounding down the cliff. How the least soundreverberated through the silence! If one of Daubrecq’s guardswas peering into the gloom from the Lovers’ Tower, it meant ashot . . . and death.And he climbed . . . he climbed.... He had climbed so long that heended by imagining that the goal was passed. Beyond a doubt, hehad slanted unawares to the right or left and he would finish atthe patrol-path. What a stupid upshot! And what other upshot couldthere be to an attempt which the swift force of events had notallowed him to study and prepare?Madly, he redoubled his efforts, raised himself by a number ofyards, slipped, recovered the lost ground, clutched a bunch ofroots that came loose in his hand, slipped once more and wasabandoning the game in despair when, suddenly, stiffening himselfand contracting his whole frame, his muscles and his will, hestopped still: a sound of voices seemed to issue from the very rockwhich he was grasping.He listened. It came from the right. Turning his head, he thoughtthat he saw a ray of light penetrating the darkness of space. Bywhat effort of energy, by what imperceptible movements he succeededin dragging himself to the spot he was never able exactly torealize. But suddenly he found himself on the ledge of a fairlywide opening, at least three yards deep, which dug into the wall ofthe cliff like a passage, while its other end, much narrower, wasclosed by three bars.Lupin crawled along. His head reached the bars. And he saw....']"
83,10,Chapter 10,"['VIII.THE LOVERS’ TOWERThe torture-chamber showed beneath him. It was a large, irregularroom, divided into unequal portions by the four wide, massivepillars that supported its arched roof. A smell of damp and mildewcame from its walls and from its flags moistened by the water thattrickled from without. Its appearance at any time must have beengruesome. But, at that moment, with the tall figures of Sébastianiand his sons, with the slanting gleams of light that fell betweenthe pillars, with the vision of the captive chained down upon thetruckle-bed, it assumed a sinister and barbarous aspect.Daubrecq was in the front part of the room, four or five yards downfrom the window at which Lupin lurked. In addition to the ancientchains that had been used to fasten him to his bed and to fastenthe bed to an iron hook in the wall, his wrists and ankles weregirt with leather thongs; and an ingenious arrangement caused hisleast movement to set in motion a bell hung to the nearest pillar.A lamp placed on a stool lit him full in the face.The Marquis d’Albufex was standing beside him. Lupin could seehis pale features, his grizzled moustache, his long, lean form ashe looked at his prisoner with an expression of content and ofgratified hatred.A few minutes passed in profound silence. Then the marquis gave anorder:“Light those three candles, Sébastiani, so that I can see himbetter.”And, when the three candles were lit and he had taken a long lookat Daubrecq, he stooped over him and said, almost gently:“I can’t say what will be the end of you and me. But at any rateI shall have had some deuced happy moments in this room. You havedone me so much harm, Daubrecq! The tears you have made me shed!Yes, real tears, real sobs of despair.... The money you have robbedme of! A fortune!... And my terror at the thought that you mightgive me away! You had but to utter my name to complete my ruin andbring about my disgrace!... Oh, you villain!...”Daubrecq did not budge. He had been deprived of his black glasses,but still kept his spectacles, which reflected the light from thecandles. He had lost a good deal of flesh; and the bones stood outabove his sunken cheeks.“Come along,” said d’Albufex. “The time has come to act. It seemsthat there are rogues prowling about the neighbourhood. Heavenforbid that they are here on your account and try to release you;for that would mean your immediate death, as you know.... Is thetrapdoor still in working order, Sébastiani?”Sébastiani came nearer, knelt on one knee and lifted and turned aring, at the foot of the bed, which Lupin had not noticed. One ofthe flagstones moved on a pivot, disclosing a black hole.“You see,” the marquis continued, “everything is provided for; andI have all that I want at hand, including dungeons: bottomlessdungeons, says the legend of the castle. So there is nothing tohope for, no help of any kind. Will you speak?”Daubrecq did not reply; and he went on:“This is the fourth time that I am questioning you, Daubrecq. It isthe fourth time that I have troubled to ask you for the documentwhich you possess, in order that I may escape your blackmailingproceedings. It is the fourth time and the last. Will you speak?”The same silence as before. D’Albufex made a sign to Sébastiani.The huntsman stepped forward, followed by two of his sons. One ofthem held a stick in his hand.“Go ahead,” said d’Albufex, after waiting a few seconds.Sébastiani slackened the thongs that bound Daubrecq’s wrists andinserted and fixed the stick between the thongs.“Shall I turn, monsieur le marquis?”A further silence. The marquis waited. Seeing that Daubrecq did notflinch, he whispered:“Can’t you speak? Why expose yourself to physical suffering?”No reply.“Turn away, Sébastiani.”Sébastiani made the stick turn a complete circle. The thongsstretched and tightened. Daubrecq gave a groan.“You won’t speak? Still, you know that I won’t give way, that Ican’t give way, that I hold you and that, if necessary, I shalltorture you till you die of it. You won’t speak? You won’t?...Sébastiani, once more.”The huntsman obeyed. Daubrecq gave a violent start of pain and fellback on his bed with a rattle in his throat.“You fool!” cried the marquis, shaking with rage. “Why don’t youspeak? What, haven’t you had enough of that list? Surely it’ssomebody else’s turn! Come, speak.... Where is it? One word. Oneword only . . . and we will leave you in peace.... And, to-morrow,when I have the list, you shall be free. Free, do you understand?But, in Heaven’s name, speak!... Oh, the brute! Sébastiani, onemore turn.”Sébastiani made a fresh effort. The bones cracked.“Help! Help!” cried Daubrecq, in a hoarse voice, vainly strugglingto release himself. And, in a spluttering whisper, “Mercy . . .mercy.”It was a dreadful sight.... The faces of the three sons werehorror-struck. Lupin shuddered, sick at heart, and realized thathe himself could never have accomplished that abominable thing. Helistened for the words that were bound to come. He must learn thetruth. Daubrecq’s secret was about to be expressed in syllables,in words wrung from him by pain. And Lupin began to think of hisretreat, of the car which was waiting for him, of the wild rush toParis, of the victory at hand.“Speak,” whispered d’Albufex. “Speak and it will be over.”“Yes . . . yes . . .” gasped Daubrecq.“Well...?”“Later . . . to-morrow....”“Oh, you’re mad!... What are you talking about: to-morrow?...Sébastiani, another turn!”“No, no!” yelled Daubrecq. “Stop!”“Speak!”“Well, then . . . the paper.... I have hidden the paper....”But his pain was too great. He raised his head with a last effort,uttered incoherent words, succeeded in twice saying, “Marie....Marie....” and fell back, exhausted and lifeless.“Let go at once!” said d’Albufex to Sébastiani. “Hang it all, canwe have overdone it?”But a rapid examination showed him that Daubrecq had only fainted.Thereupon, he himself, worn out with the excitement, dropped onthe foot of the bed and, wiping the beads of perspiration from hisforehead, stammered:“Oh, what a dirty business!”“Perhaps that’s enough for to-day,” said the huntsman, whose roughface betrayed a certain emotion. “We might try again to-morrow orthe next day....”The marquis was silent. One of the sons handed him a flask ofbrandy. He poured out half a glass and drank it down at a draught:“To-morrow?” he said. “No. Here and now. One little effort more. Atthe stage which he has reached, it won’t be difficult.” And, takingthe huntsman aside, “Did you hear what he said? What did he mean bythat word, ‘Marie’? He repeated it twice.”“Yes, twice,” said the huntsman. “Perhaps he entrusted the documentto a person called Marie.”“Not he!” protested d’Albufex. “He never entrusts anything toanybody. It means something different.”“But what, monsieur le marquis?”“We’ll soon find out, I’ll answer for it.”At that moment, Daubrecq drew a long breath and stirred on hiscouch.D’Albufex, who had now recovered all his composure and who did nottake his eyes off the enemy, went up to him and said:“You see, Daubrecq, it’s madness to resist.... Once you’re beaten,there’s nothing for it but to submit to your conqueror, insteadof allowing yourself to be tortured like an idiot.... Come, besensible.”He turned to Sébastiani:“Tighten the rope . . . let him feel it a little that will wake himup.... He’s shamming death....” Sébastiani took hold of the stickagain and turned until the cord touched the swollen flesh. Daubrecqgave a start.“That’ll do, Sébastiani,” said the marquis. “Our friend seemsfavourably disposed and understands the need for coming to terms.That’s so, Daubrecq, is it not? You prefer to have done with it?And you’re quite right!”The two men were leaning over the sufferer, Sébastiani with hishand on the stick, d’Albufex holding the lamp so as to throw thelight on Daubrecq’s face: “His lips are moving . . . he’s goingto speak. Loosen the rope a little, Sébastiani: I don’t want ourfriend to be hurt.... No, tighten it: I believe our friend ishesitating.... One turn more . . . stop!... That’s done it! Oh, mydear Daubrecq, if you can’t speak plainer than that, it’s no use!What? What did you say?”Arsène Lupin muttered an oath. Daubrecq was speaking and he, Lupin,could not hear a word of what he said! In vain, he pricked up hisears, suppressed the beating of his heart and the throbbing of histemples: not a sound reached him.“Confound it!” he thought. “I never expected this. What am I to do?”He was within an ace of covering Daubrecq with his revolver andputting a bullet into him which would cut short any explanation.But he reflected that he himself would then be none the wiser andthat it was better to trust to events in the hope of making themost of them.Meanwhile the confession continued beneath him, indistinctly,interrupted by silences and mingled with moans. D’Albufex clung tohis prey:“Go on!... Finish, can’t you?...”And he punctuated the sentences with exclamations of approval:“Good!... Capital!... Oh, how funny!... And no one suspected?...Not even Prasville?... What an ass!... Loosen a bit, Sébastiani:don’t you see that our friend is out of breath?... Keep calm,Daubrecq . . . don’t tire yourself.... And so, my dear fellow, youwere saying....”That was the last. There was a long whispering to which d’Albufexlistened without further interruption and of which Arsène Lupincould not catch the least syllable. Then the marquis drew himselfup and exclaimed, joyfully:“That’s it!.... Thank you, Daubrecq. And, believe me, I shallnever forget what you have just done. If ever you’re in need, youhave only to knock at my door and there will always be a crust ofbread for you in the kitchen and a glass of water from the filter.Sébastiani, look after monsieur le député as if he were one ofyour sons. And, first of all, release him from his bonds. It’s aheartless thing to truss one’s fellow-man like that, like a chickenon the spit!”“Shall we give him something to drink?” suggested the huntsman.“Yes, that’s it, give him a drink.”Sébastiani and his sons undid the leather straps, rubbed thebruised wrists, dressed them with an ointment and bandaged them.Then Daubrecq swallowed a few drops of brandy.“Feeling better?” said the marquis. “Pooh, it’s nothing much! Ina few hours, it won’t show; and you’ll be able to boast of havingbeen tortured, as in the good old days of the Inquisition. Youlucky dog!”He took out his watch. “Enough said! Sébastiani, let your sonswatch him in turns. You, take me to the station for the last train.”“Then are we to leave him like that, monsieur le marquis, free tomove as he pleases?”“Why not? You don’t imagine that we are going to keep him here tothe day of his death? No, Daubrecq, sleep quietly. I shall go toyour place to-morrow afternoon; and, if the document is where youtold me, a telegram shall be sent off at once and you shall be setfree. You haven’t told me a lie, I suppose?”He went back to Daubrecq and, stooping over him again:“No humbug, eh? That would be very silly of you. I should lose aday, that’s all. Whereas you would lose all the days that remain toyou to live. But no, the hiding-place is too good. A fellow doesn’tinvent a thing like that for fun. Come on, Sébastiani. You shallhave the telegram to-morrow.”“And suppose they don’t let you into the house, monsieur lemarquis?”“Why shouldn’t they?”“The house in the Square Lamartine is occupied by Prasville’s men.”“Don’t worry, Sébastiani. I shall get in. If they don’t open thedoor, there’s always the window. And, if the window won’t open,I shall arrange with one of Prasville’s men. It’s a question ofmoney, that’s all. And, thank goodness, I shan’t be short of that,henceforth! Good-night, Daubrecq.”He went out, accompanied by Sébastiani, and the heavy door closedafter them.Lupin at once effected his retreat, in accordance with a plan whichhe had worked out during this scene.The plan was simple enough: to scramble, by means of his rope,to the bottom of the cliff, take his friends with him, jump intothe motor-car and attack d’Albufex and Sébastiani on the desertedroad that leads to Aumale Station. There could be no doubt aboutthe issue of the contest. With d’Albufex and Sébastiani prisoners;it would be an easy matter to make one of them speak. D’Albufexhad shown him how to set about it; and Clarisse Mergy would beinflexible where it was a question of saving her son.He took the rope with which he had provided himself and gropedabout to find a jagged piece of rock round which to pass it, soas to leave two equal lengths hanging, by which he could lethimself down. But, when he found what he wanted, instead ofacting swiftly--for the business was urgent--he stood motionless,thinking. His scheme failed to satisfy him at the last moment.“It’s absurd, what I’m proposing,” he said to himself. “Absurd andillogical. How can I tell that d’Albufex and Sébastiani will notescape me? How can I even tell that, once they are in my power,they will speak? No, I shall stay. There are better things totry . . . much better things. It’s not those two I must be at, butDaubrecq. He’s done for; he has not a kick left in him. If he hastold the marquis his secret, there is no reason why he shouldn’ttell it to Clarisse and me, when we employ the same methods.That’s settled! We’ll kidnap the Daubrecq bird.” And he continued,“Besides, what do I risk? If the scheme miscarries, Clarisse andI will rush off to Paris and, together with Prasville, organize acareful watch in the Square Lamartine to prevent d’Albufex frombenefiting by Daubrecq’s revelations. The great thing is forPrasville to be warned of the danger. He shall be.”The church-clock in a neighbouring village struck twelve. That gaveLupin six or seven hours to put his new plan into execution. He setto work forthwith.When moving away from the embrasure which had the window at thebottom of it, he had come upon a clump of small shrubs in one ofthe hollows of the cliff. He cut away a dozen of these, with hisknife, and whittled them all down to the same size. Then he cut offtwo equal lengths from his rope. These were the uprights of theladder. He fastened the twelve little sticks between the uprightsand thus contrived a rope-ladder about six yards long.When he returned to this post, there was only one of the three sonsbeside Daubrecq’s bed in the torture-chamber. He was smoking hispipe by the lamp. Daubrecq was asleep.“Hang it!” thought Lupin. “Is the fellow going to sit there allnight? In that case, there’s nothing for me to do but to slipoff....”The idea that d’Albufex was in possession of the secret vexed himmightily. The interview at which he had assisted had left the clearimpression in his mind that the marquis was working “on his own”and that, in securing the list, he intended not only to escapeDaubrecq’s activity, but also to gain Daubrecq’s power and build uphis fortune anew by the identical means which Daubrecq had employed.That would have meant, for Lupin, a fresh battle to wage againsta fresh enemy. The rapid march of events did not allow of thecontemplation of such a possibility. He must at all costs spike theMarquis d’Albufex’ guns by warning Prasville.However, Lupin remained held back by the stubborn hope of someincident that would give him the opportunity of acting.The clock struck half-past twelve.It struck one.The waiting became terrible, all the more so as an icy mist rosefrom the valley and Lupin felt the cold penetrate to his verymarrow.He heard the trot of a horse in the distance:“Sébastiani returning from the station,” he thought.But the son who was watching in the torture-chamber, havingfinished his packet of tobacco, opened the door and asked hisbrothers if they had a pipeful for him. They made some reply; andhe went out to go to the lodge.And Lupin was astounded. No sooner was the door closed thanDaubrecq, who had been so sound asleep, sat up on his couch,listened, put one foot to the ground, followed by the other, and,standing up, tottering a little, but firmer on his legs than onewould have expected, tried his strength.“Well” said Lupin, “the beggar doesn’t take long recovering. Hecan very well help in his own escape. There’s just one point thatruffles me: will he allow himself to be convinced? Will he consentto go with me? Will he not think that this miraculous assistancewhich comes to him straight from heaven is a trap laid by themarquis?”But suddenly Lupin remembered the letter which he had madeDaubrecq’s old cousins write, the letter of recommendation, so tospeak, which the elder of the two sisters Rousselot had signed withher Christian name, Euphrasie.It was in his pocket. He took it and listened. Not a sound, exceptthe faint noise of Daubrecq’s footsteps on the flagstones. Lupinconsidered that the moment had come. He thrust his arm through thebars and threw the letter in.Daubrecq seemed thunderstruck.The letter had fluttered through the room and lay on the floor, atthree steps from him. Where did it come from? He raised his headtoward the window and tried to pierce the darkness that hid allthe upper part of the room from his eyes. Then he looked at theenvelope, without yet daring to touch it, as though he dreadeda snare. Then, suddenly, after a glance at the door, he stoopedbriskly, seized the envelope and opened it.“Ah,” he said, with a sigh of delight, when he saw the signature.He read the letter half-aloud:    “Rely implicitly on the bearer of this note. He has succeeded    in discovering the marquis’ secret, with the money which we    gave him, and has contrived a plan of escape. Everything is    prepared for your flight.  “EUPHRASIE ROUSSELOT.”He read the letter again, repeated, “Euphrasie.... Euphrasie....”and raised his head once more.Lupin whispered:“It will take me two or three hours to file through one of thebars. Are Sébastiani and his sons coming back?”“Yes, they are sure to,” replied Daubrecq, in the same low voice,“but I expect they will leave me to myself.”“But they sleep next door?”“Yes.”“Won’t they hear?”“No, the door is too thick.”“Very well. In that case, it will soon be done. I have arope-ladder. Will you be able to climb up alone, without myassistance?”“I think so.... I’ll try.... It’s my wrists that they’ve broken....Oh, the brutes! I can hardly move my hands . . . and I have verylittle strength left. But I’ll try all the same . . . needsmust....”He stopped, listened and, with his finger to his mouth, whispered:“Hush!”When Sébastiani and his sons entered the room, Daubrecq, who hadhidden the letter and lain down on his bed, pretended to wake witha start.The huntsman brought him a bottle of wine, a glass and some food:“How goes it, monsieur le député?” he cried. “Well, perhaps we didsqueeze a little hard.... It’s very painful, that thumbscrewing.Seems they often did it at the time of the Great Revolution andBonaparte . . . in the days of the _chauffeurs_.[C] A prettyinvention! Nice and clean . . . no bloodshed.... And it didn’tlast long either! In twenty minutes, you came out with the missingword!” Sébastiani burst out laughing. “By the way, monsieur ledéputé, my congratulations! A capital hiding-place. Who would eversuspect it?... You see, what put us off, monsieur le marquis andme, was that name of Marie which you let out at first. You weren’ttelling a lie; but there you are, you know: the word was onlyhalf-finished. We had to know the rest. Say what you like, it’samusing! Just think, on your study-table! Upon my word, what ajoke!”The huntsman rose and walked up and down the room, rubbing hishands:“Monsieur le marquis is jolly well pleased, so pleased, in fact,that he himself is coming to-morrow evening to let you out. Yes, hehas thought it over; there will be a few formalities: you may haveto sign a cheque or two, stump up, what, and make good monsieur lemarquis’ expense and trouble. But what’s that to you? A trifle!Not to mention that, from now on, there will be no more chains, nomore straps round your wrists; in short, you will be treated likea king! And I’ve even been told--look here!--to allow you a goodbottle of old wine and a flask of brandy.”Sébastiani let fly a few more jests, then took the lamp, made alast examination of the room and said to his sons:“Let’s leave him to sleep. You also, take a rest, all three of you.But sleep with one eye open. One never can tell....” They withdrew.Lupin waited a little longer and asked, in a low voice:“Can I begin?”“Yes, but be careful. It’s not impossible that they may go on around in an hour or two.”Lupin set to work. He had a very powerful file; and the iron ofthe bars, rusted and gnawed away by time, was, in places, almostreduced to dust. Twice Lupin stopped to listen, with ears prickedup. But it was only the patter of a rat over the rubbish in theupper story, or the flight of some night-bird; and he continued histask, encouraged by Daubrecq, who stood by the door, ready to warnhim at the least alarm.“Oof!” he said, giving a last stroke of the file. “I’m glad that’sover, for, on my word, I’ve been a bit cramped in this cursedtunnel . . . to say nothing of the cold....”He bore with all his strength upon the bar, which he had sawn frombelow, and succeeded in forcing it down sufficiently for a man’sbody to slip between the two remaining bars. Next, he had to goback to the end of the embrasure, the wider part, where he had leftthe rope-ladder. After fixing it to the bars, he called Daubrecq:“Psst!... It’s all right.... Are you ready?”“Yes . . . coming.... One more second, while I listen.... Allright.... They’re asleep.... give me the ladder.”Lupin lowered it and asked:“Must I come down?”“No.... I feel a little weak . . . but I shall manage.”Indeed, he reached the window of the embrasure pretty quickly andcrept along the passage in the wake of his rescuer. The open air,however, seemed to make him giddy. Also, to give himself strength,he had drunk half the bottle of wine; and he had a fainting-fitthat kept him lying on the stones of the embrasure for half anhour. Lupin, losing patience, was fastening him to one end of therope, of which the other end was knotted round the bars and waspreparing to let him down like a bale of goods, when Daubrecq wokeup, in better condition:“That’s over,” he said. “I feel fit now. Will it take long?”“Pretty long. We are a hundred and fifty yards up.”“How was it that d’Albufex did not foresee that it was possible toescape this way?”“The cliff is perpendicular.”“And you were able to....”“Well, your cousins insisted.... And then one has to live, youknow, and they were free with their money.”“The dear, good souls!” said Daubrecq. “Where are they?”“Down below, in a boat.”“Is there a river, then?”“Yes, but we won’t talk, if you don’t mind. It’s dangerous.”“One word more. Had you been there long when you threw me theletter?”“No, no. A quarter of an hour or so. I’ll tell you all about it....Meanwhile, we must hurry.”Lupin went first, after recommending Daubrecq to hold tight to therope and to come down backward. He would give him a hand at thedifficult places.It took them over forty minutes to reach the platform of the ledgeformed by the cliff; and Lupin had several times to help hiscompanion, whose wrists, still bruised from the torture, had lostall their strength and suppleness.Over and over again, he groaned:“Oh, the swine, they’ve done for me!... The swine!... Ah,d’Albufex, I’ll make you pay dear for this!...”“Ssh!” said Lupin.“What’s the matter?”“A noise . . . up above....”Standing motionless on the platform, they listened. Lupin thoughtof the Sire de Tancarville and the sentry who had killed him witha shot from his harquebus. He shivered, feeling all the anguish ofthe silence and the darkness.“No,” he said, “I was mistaken.... Besides, it’s absurd.... Theycan’t hit us here.”“Who would hit us?”“No one . . . no one... it was a silly notion....”He groped about till he found the uprights of the ladder; then hesaid:“There, here’s the ladder. It is fixed in the bed of the river. Afriend of mine is looking after it, as well as your cousins.”He whistled:“Here I am,” he said, in a low voice. “Hold the ladder fast.” And,to Daubrecq, “I’ll go first.”Daubrecq objected:“Perhaps it would be better for me to go down first.”“Why?”“I am very tired. You can tie your rope round my waist and holdme.... Otherwise, there is a danger that I might....”“Yes, you are right,” said Lupin. “Come nearer.”Daubrecq came nearer and knelt down on the rock. Lupin fastened therope to him and then, stooping over, grasped one of the uprights inboth hands to keep the ladder from shaking:“Off you go,” he said.At the same moment, he felt a violent pain in the shoulder:“Blast it!” he said, sinking to the ground.Daubrecq had stabbed him with a knife below the nape of the neck, alittle to the right.“You blackguard! You blackguard!”He half-saw Daubrecq, in the dark, ridding himself of his rope, andheard him whisper:“You’re a bit of a fool, you know!... You bring me a letterfrom my Rousselot cousins, in which I recognize the writing ofthe elder, Adelaide, but which that sly puss of an Adelaide,suspecting something and meaning to put me on my guard, ifnecessary, took care to sign with the name of the younger sister,Euphrasie Rousselot. You see, I tumbled to it! So, with a littlereflection . . . you are Master Arsène Lupin, are you not?Clarisse’s protector, Gilbert’s saviour.... Poor Lupin, I fearyou’re in a bad way.... I don’t use the knife often; but, when Ido, I use it with a vengeance.”He bent over the wounded man and felt in his pockets:“Give me your revolver, can’t you? You see, your friends will knowat once that it is not their governor; and they will try to secureme.... And, as I have not much strength left, a bullet or two....Good-bye, Lupin. We shall meet in the next world, eh? Book me anice flat, with all the latest conveniences.“Good-bye, Lupin. And my best thanks. For really I don’t know whatI should have done without you. By Jove, d’Albufex was hitting mehard! It’ll be a joke to meet the beggar again!”Daubrecq had completed his preparations. He whistled once more. Areply came from the boat.“Here I am,” he said.With a last effort, Lupin put out his arm to stop him. But hishand touched nothing but space. He tried to call out, to warn hisaccomplices: his voice choked in his throat.He felt a terrible numbness creep over his whole being. His templesbuzzed.Suddenly, shouts below. Then a shot. Then another, followed by atriumphant chuckle. And a woman’s wail and moans. And, soon after,two more shots.Lupin thought of Clarisse, wounded, dead perhaps; of Daubrecq,fleeing victoriously; of d’Albufex; of the crystal stopper, whichone or other of the two adversaries would recover unresisted. Thena sudden vision showed him the Sire de Tancarville falling with thewoman he loved. Then he murmured, time after time:“Clarisse.... Clarisse.... Gilbert....” A great silence overcamehim; an infinite peace entered into him; and, without the leastrevolt, he received the impression that his exhausted body, withnothing now to hold it back, was rolling to the very edge of therock, toward the abyss.[C] The name given to the brigands in the Vendée, who torturedtheir victims with fire to make them confess where their money washidden.--_Translator’s Note._']"
83,11,Chapter 11,"['IX.IN THE DARKAn hotel bedroom at Amiens.Lupin was recovering a little consciousness for the first time.Clarisse and the Masher were seated by his bedside.Both were talking; and Lupin listened to them, without opening hiseyes. He learned that they had feared for his life, but that alldanger was now removed. Next, in the course of the conversation, hecaught certain words that revealed to him what had happened in thetragic night at Mortepierre: Daubrecq’s descent; the dismay of theaccomplices, when they saw that it was not the governor; then theshort struggle: Clarisse flinging herself on Daubrecq and receivinga wound in the shoulder; Daubrecq leaping to the bank; the Growlerfiring two revolver-shots and darting off in pursuit of him; theMasher clambering up the ladder and finding the governor in a swoon:“True as I live,” said the Masher, “I can’t make out even now howhe did not roll over. There was a sort of hollow at that place, butit was a sloping hollow; and, half dead as he was, he must havehung on with his ten fingers. Crikey, it was time I came!”Lupin listened, listened in despair. He collected his strength tograsp and understand the words. But suddenly a terrible sentencewas uttered: Clarisse, weeping, spoke of the eighteen days that hadelapsed, eighteen more days lost to Gilbert’s safety.Eighteen days! The figure terrified Lupin. He felt that all wasover, that he would never be able to recover his strength andresume the struggle and that Gilbert and Vaucheray were doomed....His brain slipped away from him. The fever returned and thedelirium.       *       *       *       *       *And more days came and went. It was perhaps the time of his lifeof which Lupin speaks with the greatest horror. He retained justenough consciousness and had sufficiently lucid moments to realizethe position exactly. But he was not able to coordinate his ideas,to follow a line of argument nor to instruct or forbid his friendsto adopt this or that line of conduct.Often, when he emerged from his torpor, he found his hand inClarisse’s and, in that half-slumbering condition in which a feverkeeps you, he would address strange words to her, words of love andpassion, imploring her and thanking her and blessing her for allthe light and joy which she had brought into his darkness.Then, growing calmer and not fully understanding what he had said,he tried to jest:“I have been delirious, have I not? What a heap of nonsense I musthave talked!”But Lupin felt by Clarisse’s silence that he could safely talkas much nonsense as ever his fever suggested to him. She did nothear. The care and attention which she lavished on the patient, herdevotion, her vigilance, her alarm at the least relapse: all thiswas meant not for him, but for the possible saviour of Gilbert. Sheanxiously watched the progress of his convalescence. How soon wouldhe be fit to resume the campaign? Was it not madness to linger byhis side, when every day carried away a little hope?Lupin never ceased repeating to himself, with the inward beliefthat, by so doing, he could influence the course of his illness:“I will get well.... I will get well....”And he lay for days on end without moving, so as not to disturb thedressing of his wound nor increase the excitement of his nerves inthe smallest degree.He also strove not to think of Daubrecq. But the image of his direadversary haunted him; and he reconstituted the various phasesof the escape, the descent of the cliff.... One day, struck by aterrible memory, he exclaimed:“The list! The list of the Twenty-seven! Daubrecq must have it bynow . . . or else d’Albufex. It was on the table!”Clarisse reassured him:“No one can have taken it,” she declared. “The Growler was in Paristhat same day, with a note from me for Prasville, entreating him toredouble his watch in the Square Lamartine, so that no one shouldenter, especially d’Albufex....”“But Daubrecq?”“He is wounded. He cannot have gone home.”“Ah, well,” he said, “that’s all right!... But you too werewounded....”“A mere scratch on the shoulder.”Lupin was easier in his mind after these revelations. Nevertheless,he was pursued by stubborn notions which he was unable either todrive from his brain or to put into words. Above all, he thoughtincessantly of that name of “Marie” which Daubrecq’s sufferingshad drawn from him. What did the name refer to? Was it the titleof one of the books on the shelves, or a part of the title? Wouldthe book in question supply the key to the mystery? Or was it thecombination word of a safe? Was it a series of letters writtensomewhere: on a wall, on a paper, on a wooden panel, on the mountof a drawing, on an invoice?These questions, to which he was unable to find a reply, obsessedand exhausted him.One morning Arsène Lupin woke feeling a great deal better. Thewound was closed, the temperature almost normal. The doctor, apersonal friend, who came every day from Paris, promised that hemight get up two days later. And, on that day, in the absence ofhis accomplices and of Mme. Mergy, all three of whom had left twodays before, in quest of information, he had himself moved to theopen window.He felt life return to him with the sunlight, with the balmyair that announced the approach of spring. He recovered theconcatenation of his ideas; and facts once more took their place inhis brain in their logical sequence and in accordance with theirrelations one to the other.In the evening he received a telegram from Clarisse to say thatthings were going badly and that she, the Growler and the Masherwere all staying in Paris. He was much disturbed by this wire andhad a less quiet night. What could the news be that had given riseto Clarisse’s telegram?But, the next day, she arrived in his room looking very pale, hereyes red with weeping, and, utterly worn out, dropped into a chair:“The appeal has been rejected,” she stammered.He mastered his emotion and asked, in a voice of surprise:“Were you relying on that?”“No, no,” she said, “but, all the same . . . one hopes in spite ofone’s self.”“Was it rejected yesterday?”“A week ago. The Masher kept it from me; and I have not dared toread the papers lately.”“There is always the commutation of sentence,” he suggested.“The commutation? Do you imagine that they will commute thesentence of Arsène Lupin’s accomplices?”She ejaculated the words with a violence and a bitterness which hepretended not to notice; and he said:“Vaucheray perhaps not.... But they will take pity on Gilbert, onhis youth....”“They will do nothing of the sort.”“How do you know?”“I have seen his counsel.”“You have seen his counsel! And you told him....”“I told him that I was Gilbert’s mother and I asked him whether,by proclaiming my son’s identity, we could not influence theresult . . . or at least delay it.”“You would do that?” he whispered. “You would admit....”“Gilbert’s life comes before everything. What do I care about myname! What do I care about my husband’s name!”“And your little Jacques?” he objected. “Have you the right to ruinJacques, to make him the brother of a man condemned to death?”She hung her head. And he resumed:“What did the counsel say?”“He said that an act of that sort would not help Gilbert in theremotest degree. And, in spite of all his protests, I could seethat, as far as he was concerned, he had no illusions left andthat the pardoning commission are bound to find in favour of theexecution.”“The commission, I grant you; but what of the president of theRepublic?”“The president always goes by the advice of the commission.”“He will not do so this time.”“And why not?”“Because we shall bring influence to bear upon him.”“How?”“By the conditional surrender of the list of the Twenty-seven!”“Have you it?”“No, but I shall have it.”His certainty had not wavered. He made the statement with equalcalmness and faith in the infinite power of his will.She had lost some part of her confidence in him and she shruggedher shoulders lightly:“If d’Albufex has not purloined the list, one man alone canexercise any influence; one man alone: Daubrecq.”She spoke these words in a low and absent voice that made himshudder. Was she still thinking, as he had often seemed to feel, ofgoing back to Daubrecq and paying him for Gilbert’s life?“You have sworn an oath to me,” he said. “I’m reminding you of it.It was agreed that the struggle with Daubrecq should be directed byme and that there would never be a possibility of any arrangementbetween you and him.”She retorted:“I don’t even know where he is. If I knew, wouldn’t you know?”It was an evasive answer. But he did not insist, resolving to watchher at the opportune time; and he asked her, for he had not yetbeen told all the details:“Then it’s not known what became of Daubrecq?”“No. Of course, one of the Growler’s bullets struck him. For, nextday, we picked up, in a coppice, a handkerchief covered with blood.Also, it seems that a man was seen at Aumale Station, looking verytired and walking with great difficulty. He took a ticket forParis, stepped into the first train and that is all....”“He must be seriously wounded,” said Lupin, “and he is nursinghimself in some safe retreat. Perhaps, also, he considers it wiseto lie low for a few weeks and avoid any traps on the part of thepolice, d’Albufex, you, myself and all his other enemies.”He stopped to think and continued:“What has happened at Mortepierre since Daubrecq’s escape? Hasthere been no talk in the neighbourhood?”“No, the rope was removed before daybreak, which proves thatSébastiani or his sons discovered Daubrecq’s flight on the samenight. Sébastiani was away the whole of the next day.”“Yes, he will have informed the marquis. And where is the marquishimself?”“At home. And, from what the Growler has heard, there is nothingsuspicious there either.”“Are they certain that he has not been inside Daubrecq’s house?”“As certain as they can be.”“Nor Daubrecq?”“Nor Daubrecq.”“Have you seen Prasville?”“Prasville is away on leave. But Chief-inspector Blanchon, who hascharge of the case, and the detectives who are guarding the housedeclare that, in accordance with Prasville’s instructions, theirwatch is not relaxed for a moment, even at night; that one of them,turn and turn about, is always on duty in the study; and that noone, therefore, can have gone in.”“So, on principle,” Arsène Lupin concluded, “the crystal stoppermust still be in Daubrecq’s study?”“If it was there before Daubrecq’s disappearance, it should bethere now.”“And on the study-table.”“On the study-table? Why do you say that?”“Because I know,” said Lupin, who had not forgotten Sébastiani’swords.“But you don’t know the article in which the stopper is hidden?”“No. But a study-table, a writing-desk, is a limited space. One canexplore it in twenty minutes. One can demolish it, if necessary, inten.”The conversation had tired Arsène Lupin a little. As he did notwish to commit the least imprudence, he said to Clarisse:“Listen. I will ask you to give me two or three days more. This isMonday, the 4th of March. On Wednesday or Thursday, at latest, Ishall be up and about. And you can be sure that we shall succeed.”“And, in the meantime....”“In the meantime, go back to Paris. Take rooms, with the Growlerand the Masher, in the Hôtel Franklin, near the Trocadero, and keepa watch on Daubrecq’s house. You are free to go in and out as youplease. Stimulate the zeal of the detectives on duty.”“Suppose Daubrecq returns?”“If he returns, that will be so much the better: we shall have him.”“And, if he only passes?”“In that case, the Growler and the Masher must follow him.”“And if they lose sight of him?”Lupin did not reply. No one felt more than he how fatal it was toremain inactive in a hotel bedroom and how useful his presencewould have been on the battlefield! Perhaps even this vague ideahad already prolonged his illness beyond the ordinary limits.He murmured:“Go now, please.”There was a constraint between them which increased as the awfulday drew nigh. In her injustice, forgetting or wishing to forgetthat it was she who had forced her son into the Enghien enterprise,Mme. Mergy did not forget that the law was pursuing Gilbert withsuch rigour not so much because he was a criminal as because hewas an accomplice of Arsène Lupin’s. And then, notwithstanding allhis efforts, notwithstanding his prodigious expenditure of energy,what result had Lupin achieved, when all was said? How far had hisintervention benefited Gilbert?After a pause, she rose and left him alone.The next day he was feeling rather low. But on the day after, theWednesday, when his doctor wanted him to keep quiet until the endof the week, he said:“If not, what have I to fear?”“A return of the fever.”“Nothing worse?”“No. The wound is pretty well healed.”“Then I don’t care. I’ll go back with you in your car. We shall bein Paris by mid-day.”What decided Lupin to start at once was, first, a letter in whichClarisse told him that she had found Daubrecq’s traces, and, also,a telegram, published in the Amiens papers, which stated that theMarquis d’Albufex had been arrested for his complicity in theaffair of the canal.Daubrecq was taking his revenge.Now the fact that Daubrecq was taking his revenge proved that themarquis had not been able to prevent that revenge by seizing thedocument which was on the writing-desk in the study. It provedthat Chief-inspector Blanchon and the detectives had kept a goodwatch. It proved that the crystal stopper was still in the SquareLamartine.It was still there; and this showed either that Daubrecq had notventured to go home, or else that his state of health hindered himfrom doing so, or else again that he had sufficient confidence inthe hiding-place not to trouble to put himself out.In any case, there was no doubt as to the course to be pursued:Lupin must act and he must act smartly. He must forestall Daubrecqand get hold of the crystal stopper.When they had crossed the Bois de Boulogne and were nearing theSquare Lamartine, Lupin took leave of the doctor and stopped thecar. The Growler and the Masher, to whom he had wired, met him.“Where’s Mme. Mergy?” he asked.“She has not been back since yesterday; she sent us an expressmessage to say that she saw Daubrecq leaving his cousins’ place andgetting into a cab. She knows the number of the cab and will keepus informed.”“Nothing further?”“Nothing further.”“No other news?”“Yes, the _Paris-Midi_ says that d’Albufex opened his veins lastnight, with a piece of broken glass, in his cell at the Santé. Heseems to have left a long letter behind him, confessing his fault,but accusing Daubrecq of his death and exposing the part played byDaubrecq in the canal affair.”“Is that all?”“No. The same paper stated that it has reason to believe that thepardoning commission, after examining the record, has rejectedVaucheray and Gilbert’s petition and that their counsel willprobably be received in audience by the president on Friday.”Lupin gave a shudder.“They’re losing no time,” he said. “I can see that Daubrecq, onthe very first day, put the screw on the old judicial machine. Oneshort week more . . . and the knife falls. My poor Gilbert! If, onFriday next, the papers which your counsel submits to the presidentof the Republic do not contain the conditional offer of the list ofthe Twenty-seven, then, my poor Gilbert, you are done for!”“Come, come, governor, are you losing courage?”“I? Rot! I shall have the crystal stopper in an hour. In two hours,I shall see Gilbert’s counsel. And the nightmare will be over.”“Well done, governor! That’s like your old self. Shall we wait foryou here?”“No, go back to your hotel. I’ll join you later.”They parted. Lupin walked straight to the house and rang the bell.A detective opened the door and recognized him:“M. Nicole, I believe?”“Yes,” he said. “Is Chief-inspector Blanchon here?”“He is.”“Can I speak to him?”The man took him to the study, where Chief-inspector Blanchonwelcomed him with obvious pleasure.“Well, chief-inspector, one would say there was something new?”“M. Nicole, my orders are to place myself entirely at yourdisposal; and I may say that I am very glad to see you to-day.”“Why so?”“Because there is something new.”“Something serious?”“Something very serious.”“Quick, speak.”“Daubrecq has returned.”“Eh, what!” exclaimed Lupin, with a start. “Daubrecq returned? Ishe here?”“No, he has gone.”“And did he come in here, in the study?”“Yes.”“This morning.”“And you did not prevent him?”“What right had I?”“And you left him alone?”“By his positive orders, yes, we left him alone.”Lupin felt himself turn pale. Daubrecq had come back to fetch thecrystal stopper!He was silent for some time and repeated to himself:“He came back to fetch it.... He was afraid that it would befound and he has taken it.... Of course, it was inevitable . . .with d’Albufex arrested, with d’Albufex accused and accusing him,Daubrecq was bound to defend himself. It’s a difficult game forhim. After months and months of mystery, the public is at lastlearning that the infernal being who contrived the whole tragedyof the Twenty-Seven and who ruins and kills his adversaries is he,Daubrecq. What would become of him if, by a miracle, his talismandid not protect him? He has taken it back.”And, trying to make his voice sound firm, he asked:“Did he stay long?”“Twenty seconds, perhaps.”“What! Twenty seconds? No longer?”“No longer.”“What time was it?”“Ten o’clock.”“Could he have known of the Marquis d’Albufex’ suicide by then?”“Yes. I saw the special edition of the _Paris-Midi_ in his pocket.”“That’s it, that’s it,” said Lupin. And he asked, “Did M. Prasvillegive you no special instructions in case Daubrecq should return?”“No. So, in M. Prasville’s absence, I telephoned to thepolice-office and I am waiting. The disappearance of Daubrecq thedeputy caused a great stir, as you know, and our presence here hasa reason, in the eyes of the public, as long as that disappearancecontinues. But, now that Daubrecq has returned, now that we haveproofs that he is neither under restraint nor dead, how can we stayin the house?”“It doesn’t matter,” said Lupin, absently. “It doesn’t matterwhether the house is guarded or not. Daubrecq has been; thereforethe crystal stopper is no longer here.”He had not finished the sentence, when a question quite naturallyforced itself upon his mind. If the crystal stopper was no longerthere, would this not be obvious from some material sign? Had theremoval of that object, doubtless contained within another object,left no trace, no void?It was easy to ascertain. Lupin had simply to examine thewriting-desk, for he knew, from Sébastiani’s chaff, that this wasthe spot of the hiding-place. And the hiding-place could not be acomplicated one, seeing that Daubrecq had not remained in the studyfor more than twenty seconds, just long enough, so to speak, towalk in and walk out again.Lupin looked. And the result was immediate. His memory hadso faithfully recorded the picture of the desk, with all thearticles lying on it, that the absence of one of them struckhim instantaneously, as though that article and that alone werethe characteristic sign which distinguished this particularwriting-table from every other table in the world.“Oh,” he thought, quivering with delight, “everything fits in!Everything!... Down to that half-word which the torture drew fromDaubrecq in the tower at Mortepierre! The riddle is solved. Thereneed be no more hesitation, no more groping in the dark. The end isin sight.”And, without answering the inspector’s questions, he thought of thesimplicity of the hiding-place and remembered Edgar Allan Poe’swonderful story in which the stolen letter, so eagerly sought for,is, in a manner of speaking, displayed to all eyes. People do notsuspect what does not appear to be hidden.“Well, well,” said Lupin, as he went out, greatly excited by hisdiscovery, “I seem doomed, in this confounded adventure, to knockup against disappointments to the finish. Everything that I buildcrumbles to pieces at once. Every victory ends in disaster.”Nevertheless, he did not allow himself to be cast down. On theone hand, he now knew where Daubrecq the deputy hid the crystalstopper. On the other hand, he would soon learn from Clarisse Mergywhere Daubrecq himself was lurking. The rest, to him, would bechild’s play.The Growler and the Masher were waiting for him in the drawing-roomof the Hôtel Franklin, a small family-hotel near the Trocadero.Mme. Mergy had not yet written to him.“Oh,” he said, “I can trust her! She will hang on to Daubrecq untilshe is certain.”However, toward the end of the afternoon, he began to growimpatient and anxious. He was fighting one of those battles--thelast, he hoped--in which the least delay might jeopardizeeverything. If Daubrecq threw Mme. Mergy off the scent, how was heto be caught again? They no longer had weeks or days, but only afew hours, a terribly limited number of hours, in which to repairany mistakes that they might commit.He saw the proprietor of the hotel and asked him:“Are you sure that there is no express letter for my two friends?”“Quite sure, sir.”“Nor for me, M. Nicole?”“No, sir.”“That’s curious,” said Lupin. “We were certain that we should hearfrom Mme. Audran.”Audran was the name under which Clarisse was staying at the hotel.“But the lady has been,” said the proprietor.“What’s that?”“She came some time ago and, as the gentlemen were not there, lefta letter in her room. Didn’t the porter tell you?”Lupin and his friends hurried upstairs. There was a letter on thetable.“Hullo!” said Lupin. “It’s been opened! How is that? And why has itbeen cut about with scissors?”The letter contained the following lines:    “Daubrecq has spent the week at the Hôtel Central. This morning    he had his luggage taken to the Gare de ---- and telephoned to    reserve a berth in the sleeping-car ---- for ----    “I do not know when the train starts. But I shall be at the    station all the afternoon. Come as soon as you can, all three    of you. We will arrange to kidnap him.”“What next?” said the Masher. “At which station? And where’s thesleeping-car for? She has cut out just the words we wanted!”“Yes,” said the Growler. “Two snips with the scissors in eachplace; and the words which we most want are gone. Who ever saw sucha thing? Has Mme. Mergy lost her head?”Lupin did not move. A rush of blood was beating at his temples withsuch violence that he glued his fists to them and pressed with allhis might. His fever returned, burning and riotous, and his will,incensed to the verge of physical suffering, concentrated itselfupon that stealthy enemy, which must be controlled then and there,if he himself did not wish to be irretrievably beaten.He muttered, very calmly:“Daubrecq has been here.”“Daubrecq!”“We can’t suppose that Mme. Mergy has been amusing herself bycutting out those two words. Daubrecq has been here. Mme. Mergythought that she was watching him. He was watching her instead.”“How?”“Doubtless through that hall-porter who did not tell us that Mme.Mergy had been to the hotel, but who must have told Daubrecq.He came. He read the letter. And, by way of getting at us, hecontented himself with cutting out the essential words.”“We can find out . . . we can ask....”“What’s the good? What’s the use of finding out how he came, whenwe know that he did come?”He examined the letter for some time, turned it over and over, thenstood up and said:“Come along.”“Where to?”“Gare de Lyon.”“Are you sure?”“I am sure of nothing with Daubrecq. But, as we have to choose,according to the contents of the letter, between the Gare _de_l’Est and the Gare _de_ Lyon, [D] I am presuming that his business,his pleasure and his health are more likely to take Daubrecq in thedirection of Marseilles and the Riviera than to the Gare de l’Est.”It was past seven when Lupin and his companions left the HôtelFranklin. A motor-car took them across Paris at full speed, butthey soon saw that Clarisse Mergy was not outside the station, norin the waiting-rooms, nor on any of the platforms.“Still,” muttered Lupin, whose agitation grew as the obstaclesincreased, “still, if Daubrecq booked a berth in a sleeping-car, itcan only have been in an evening train. And it is barely half-pastseven!”A train was starting, the night express. They had time to rushalong the corridor. Nobody . . . neither Mme. Mergy nor Daubrecq....But, as they were all three going, a porter accosted them near therefreshment-room:“Is one of you gentlemen looking for a lady?”“Yes, yes, . . . I am,” said Lupin. “Quick, what is it?”“Oh, it’s you, sir! The lady told me there might be three of you ortwo of you.... And I didn’t know....”“But, in heaven’s name, speak, man! What lady?”“The lady who spent the whole day on the pavement, with theluggage, waiting.”“Well, out with it! Has she taken a train?”“Yes, the _train-de-luxe_, at six-thirty: she made up her mind atthe last moment, she told me to say. And I was also to say that thegentleman was in the same train and that they were going to MonteCarlo.”“Damn it!” muttered Lupin. “We ought to have taken the express justnow! There’s nothing left but the evening trains, and they crawl!We’ve lost over three hours.”The wait seemed interminable. They booked their seats. Theytelephoned to the proprietor of the Hôtel Franklin to send on theirletters to Monte Carlo. They dined. They read the papers. At last,at half-past nine, the train started.And so, by a really tragic series of circumstances, at the mostcritical moment of the contest, Lupin was turning his back on thebattlefield and going away, at haphazard, to seek, he knew notwhere, and beat, he knew not how, the most formidable and elusiveenemy that he had ever fought.And this was happening four days, five days at most, before theinevitable execution of Gilbert and Vaucheray.It was a bad and painful night for Lupin. The more he studied thesituation the more terrible it appeared to him. On every side hewas faced with uncertainty, darkness, confusion, helplessness.True, he knew the secret of the crystal stopper. But how was he toknow that Daubrecq would not change or had not already changed histactics? How was he to know that the list of the Twenty-seven wasstill inside that crystal stopper or that the crystal stopper wasstill inside the object where Daubrecq had first hidden it?And there was a further serious reason for alarm in the fact thatClarisse Mergy thought that she was shadowing and watching Daubrecqat a time when, on the contrary, Daubrecq was watching her, havingher shadowed and dragging her, with diabolical cleverness, towardthe places selected by himself, far from all help or hope of help.Oh, Daubrecq’s game was clear as daylight! Did not Lupin know theunhappy woman’s hesitations? Did he not know--and the Growler andthe Masher confirmed it most positively--that Clarisse lookedupon the infamous bargain planned by Daubrecq in the light of apossible, an acceptable thing? In that case, how could he, Lupin,succeed? The logic of events, so powerfully moulded by Daubrecq,led to a fatal result: the mother must sacrifice herself and, tosave her son, throw her scruples, her repugnance, her very honour,to the winds!“Oh, you scoundrel!” snarled Lupin, in a fit of rage. “If I gethold of you, I’ll make you dance to a pretty tune! I wouldn’t be inyour shoes for a great deal, when that happens.”They reached Monte Carlo at three o’clock in the afternoon. Lupinwas at once disappointed not to see Clarisse on the platform at thestation.He waited. No messenger came up to him.He asked the porters and ticket-collectors if they had noticed,among the crowd, two travellers answering to the description ofDaubrecq and Clarisse. They had not.He had, therefore, to set to work and hunt through all the hotelsand lodging-houses in the principality. Oh, the time wasted!By the following evening, Lupin knew, beyond a doubt, that Daubrecqand Clarisse were not at Monte Carlo, nor at Monaco, nor at the Capd’Ail, nor at La Turbie, nor at Cap Martin.“Where can they be then?” he wondered, trembling with rage.At last, on the Saturday, he received, at the _poste restante_, atelegram which had been readdressed from the Hôtel Franklin andwhich said:    “He got out at Cannes and is going on to San Remo, Hôtel Palace    des Ambassadeurs.  “CLARISSE.”The telegram was dated the day before.“Hang it!” exclaimed Lupin. “They passed through Monte Carlo. Oneof us ought to have remained at the station. I did think of it;but, in the midst of all that bustle....”Lupin and his friends took the first train for Italy.They crossed the frontier at twelve o’clock. The train entered thestation at San Remo at twelve-forty.They at once saw an hotel-porter, with “Ambassadeurs-Palace” onhis braided cap, who seemed to be looking for some one among thearrivals.Lupin went up to him:“Are you looking for M. Nicole?”“Yes, M. Nicole and two gentlemen.”“From a lady?”“Yes, Mme. Mergy.”“Is she staying at your hotel?”“No. She did not get out. She beckoned to me, described you threegentlemen and told me to say that she was going on to Genoa, to theHôtel Continental.”“Was she by herself?”“Yes.”Lupin tipped the man, dismissed him and turned to his friends:“This is Saturday. If the execution takes place on Monday, there’snothing to be done. But Monday is not a likely day.... What I haveto do is to lay hands on Daubrecq to-night and to be in Paris onMonday, with the document. It’s our last chance. Let’s take it.”The Growler went to the booking-office and returned with threetickets for Genoa.The engine whistled.Lupin had a last hesitation:“No, really, it’s too childish! What are we doing? We ought to bein Paris, not here!... Just think!...”He was on the point of opening the door and jumping out on thepermanent way. But his companions held him back. The train started.He sat down again.And they continued their mad pursuit, travelling at random, towardthe unknown....And this happened two days before the inevitable execution ofGilbert and Vaucheray.[D] These are the only two main-line stations in Paris withthe word _de_ in their name. The others have _du_, as the Garedu Nord or the Gare du Luxembourg, d’ as the Gare d’Orleans,or no participle at all, as the Gare Saint-Lazare or the GareMontparnasse.--_Translator’s Note._']"
83,12,Chapter 12,"['X.EXTRA-DRY?On one of the hills that girdle Nice with the finest scenery inthe world, between the Vallon de Saint-Silvestre and the Vallonde La Mantéga, stands a huge hotel which overlooks the town andthe wonderful Baie des Anges. A crowd flocks to it from all parts,forming a medley of every class and nation.On the evening of the same Saturday when Lupin, the Growler andthe Masher were plunging into Italy, Clarisse Mergy entered thishotel, asked for a bedroom facing south and selected No. 130, onthe second floor, a room which had been vacant since that morning.The room was separated from No. 129 by two partition-doors. As soonas she was alone, Clarisse pulled back the curtain that concealedthe first door, noiselessly drew the bolt and put her ear to thesecond door:“He is here,” she thought. “He is dressing to go to the club . . .as he did yesterday.”When her neighbour had gone, she went into the passage and,availing herself of a moment when there was no one in sight, walkedup to the door of No. 129. The door was locked.She waited all the evening for her neighbour’s return and did notgo to bed until two o’clock. On Sunday morning, she resumed herwatch.The neighbour went out at eleven. This time he left the key in thedoor.Hurriedly turning the key, Clarisse entered boldly, went to thepartition-door, raised the curtain, drew the bolt and found herselfin her own room.In a few minutes, she heard two chambermaids doing the room in No.129.She waited until they were gone. Then, feeling sure that she wouldnot be disturbed, she once more slipped into the other room.Her excitement made her lean against a chair. After days and nightsof stubborn pursuit, after alternate hopes and disappointments,she had at last succeeded in entering a room occupied by Daubrecq.She could look about at her ease; and, if she did not discover thecrystal stopper, she could at least hide in the space between thepartition-doors, behind the hanging, see Daubrecq, spy upon hismovements and surprise his secret.She looked around her. A travelling-bag at once caught herattention. She managed to open it; but her search was useless.She ransacked the trays of a trunk and the compartments of aportmanteau. She searched the wardrobe, the writing-table, thechest of drawers, the bathroom, all the tables, all the furniture.She found nothing.She gave a start when she saw a scrap of paper on the balcony,lying as though flung there by accident:“Can it be a trick of Daubrecq’s?” she thought, out loud. “Can thatscrap of paper contain....”“No,” said a voice behind her, as she put her hand on the latch.She turned and saw Daubrecq.She felt neither astonishment nor alarm, nor even any embarrassmentat finding herself face to face with him. She had suffered toodeeply for months to trouble about what Daubrecq could think of heror say, at catching her in the act of spying.She sat down wearily.He grinned:“No, you’re out of it, dear friend. As the children say, you’re not‘burning’ at all. Oh, not a bit of it! And it’s so easy! Shall Ihelp you? It’s next to you, dear friend, on that little table....And yet, by Jove, there’s not much on that little table! Somethingto read, something to write with, something to smoke, somethingto eat . . . and that’s all.... Will you have one of thesecandied fruits?... Or perhaps you would rather wait for the moresubstantial meal which I have ordered?”Clarisse made no reply. She did not even seem to listen to what hewas saying, as though she expected other words, more serious words,which he could not fail to utter.He cleared the table of all the things that lay upon it and putthem on the mantel-piece. Then he rang the bell.A head-waiter appeared. Daubrecq asked:“Is the lunch which I ordered ready?”“Yes, sir.”“It’s for two, isn’t it?”“Yes, sir.”“And the champagne?”“Yes, sir.”“Extra-dry?”“Yes, sir.”Another waiter brought a tray and laid two covers on the table: acold lunch, some fruit and a bottle of champagne in an ice-pail.Then the two waiters withdrew.“Sit down, dear lady. As you see, I was thinking of you and yourcover is laid.”And, without seeming to observe that Clarisse was not at allprepared to do honour to his invitation, he sat down, began to eatand continued:“Yes, upon my word, I hoped that you would end by consenting tothis little private meeting. During the past week, while youwere keeping so assiduous a watch upon me, I did nothing but sayto myself, ‘I wonder which she prefers: sweet champagne, drychampagne, or extra-dry?’ I was really puzzled. Especially afterour departure from Paris. I had lost your tracks, that is to say,I feared that you had lost mine and abandoned the pursuit whichwas so gratifying to me. When I went for a walk, I missed yourbeautiful dark eyes, gleaming with hatred under your hair justtouched with gray. But, this morning, I understood: the room nextto mine was empty at last; and my friend Clarisse was able to takeup her quarters, so to speak, by my bedside. From that moment I wasreassured. I felt certain that, on coming back--instead of lunchingin the restaurant as usual--I should find you arranging my thingsto your convenience and suiting your own taste. That was why Iordered two covers: one for your humble servant, the other for hisfair friend.”She was listening to him now and in the greatest terror. SoDaubrecq knew that he was spied upon! For a whole week he had seenthrough her and all her schemes!In a low voice, anxious-eyed, she asked:“You did it on purpose, did you not? You only went away to drag mewith you?”“Yes,” he said.“But why? Why?”“Do you mean to say that you don’t know?” retorted Daubrecq,laughing with a little cluck of delight.She half-rose from her chair and, bending toward him, thought, asshe thought each time, of the murder which she could commit, of themurder which she would commit. One revolver-shot and the odiousbrute was done for.Slowly her hand glided to the weapon concealed in her bodice.Daubrecq said:“One second, dear friend.... You can shoot presently; but I beg youfirst to read this wire which I have just received.”She hesitated, not knowing what trap he was laying for her; but hewent on, as he produced a telegram:“It’s about your son.”“Gilbert?” she asked, greatly concerned.“Yes, Gilbert.... Here, read it.”She gave a yell of dismay. She had read:    “Execution on Tuesday morning.”And she at once flung herself on Daubrecq, crying:“It’s not true!... It’s a lie . . . to madden me.... Oh, I knowyou: you are capable of anything! Confess! It won’t be on Tuesday,will it? In two days! No, no.... I tell you, we have four days yet,five days, in which to save him.... Confess it, confess it!”She had no strength left, exhausted by this fit of rebellion; andher voice uttered none but inarticulate sounds.He looked at her for a moment, then poured himself out a glass ofchampagne and drank it down at a gulp. He took a few steps up anddown the room, came back to her and said:“Listen to me, _darling_....”The insult made her quiver with an unexpected energy. She drewherself up and, panting with indignation, said:“I forbid you.... I forbid you to speak to me like that. I will notaccept such an outrage. You wretch!...”He shrugged his shoulders and resumed:“Pah, I see you’re not quite alive to the position. That comes,of course, because you still hope for assistance in some quarter.Prasville, perhaps? The excellent Prasville, whose right hand youare.... My dear friend, a forlorn hope.... You must know thatPrasville is mixed up in the Canal affair! Not directly: that isto say, his name is not on the list of the Twenty-seven; but it isthere under the name of one of his friends, an ex-deputy calledVorenglade, Stanislas Vorenglade, his man of straw, apparently: apenniless individual whom I left alone and rightly. I knew nothingof all that until this morning, when, lo and behold, I received aletter informing me of the existence of a bundle of documents whichprove the complicity of our one and only Prasville! And who is myinformant? Vorenglade himself! Vorenglade, who, tired of living inpoverty, wants to extort money from Prasville, at the risk of beingarrested, and who will be delighted to come to terms with me. AndPrasville will get the sack. Oh, what a lark! I swear to you thathe will get the sack, the villain! By Jove, but he’s annoyed melong enough! Prasville, old boy, you’ve deserved it....”He rubbed his hands together, revelling in his coming revenge. Andhe continued:“You see, my dear Clarisse . . . there’s nothing to be done inthat direction. What then? What straw will you cling to? Why, Iwas forgetting: M. Arsène Lupin! Mr. Growler! Mr. Masher!... Pah,you’ll admit that those gentlemen have not shone and that all theirfeats of prowess have not prevented me from going my own littleway. It was bound to be. Those fellows imagine that there’s no oneto equal them. When they meet an adversary like myself, one whois not to be bounced, it upsets them and they make blunder afterblunder, while still believing that they are hoodwinking him likemad. Schoolboys, that’s what they are! However, as you seem to havesome illusions left about the aforesaid Lupin, as you are countingon that poor devil to crush me and to work a miracle in favour ofyour innocent Gilbert, come, let’s dispel that illusion. Oh! Lupin!Lord above, she believes in Lupin! She places her last hopes inLupin! Lupin! Just wait till I prick you, my illustrious windbag!”He took up the receiver of the telephone which communicated withthe hall of the hotel and said:“I’m No. 129, mademoiselle. Would you kindly ask the personsitting opposite your office to come up to me?... Huh!... Yes,mademoiselle, the gentleman in a gray felt hat. He knows. Thankyou, mademoiselle.”Hanging up the receiver, he turned to Clarisse:“Don’t be afraid. The man is discretion itself. Besides, it’sthe motto of his trade: ‘Discretion and dispatch.’ As a retireddetective, he has done me a number of services, including that offollowing you while you were following me. Since our arrival in thesouth, he has been less busy with you; but that was because he wasmore busy elsewhere. Come in, Jacob.”He himself opened the door, and a short, thin man, with a redmoustache, entered the room.“Please tell this lady, Jacob, in a few brief words, what you havedone since Wednesday evening, when, after letting her get into the_train-de-luxe_ which was taking me from the Gare de Lyon to thesouth, you yourself remained on the platform at the station. Ofcourse, I am not asking how you spent your time, except in so faras concerns the lady and the business with which I entrusted you.”Jacob dived into the inside-pocket of his jacket and produced alittle note-book of which he turned over the pages and read themaloud in the voice of a man reading a report:    “_Wednesday evening_, 8.15. Gare de Lyon. Wait for two gents,    Growler and Masher. They come with another whom I don’t know    yet, but who can only be M. Nicole. Give a porter ten francs    for the loan of his cap and blouse. Accost the gents and tell    them, from a lady, ‘that they were gone to Monte Carlo.’ Next,    telephone to the porter at the Hôtel Franklin. All telegrams    sent to his boss and dispatched by said boss will be read by    said hotel-porter and, if necessary, intercepted.    “_Thursday._ Monte Carlo. The three gents search the hotels.    “_Friday._ Flying visits to La Turbie, the Cap d’Ail, Cap    Martin. M. Daubrecq rings me up. Thinks it wiser to send the    gents to Italy. Make the porter of the Hôtel Franklin send    them a telegram appointing a meeting at San Remo.    “_Saturday._ San Remo. Station platform. Give the porter of    the Ambassadeurs-Palace ten francs for the loan of his cap.    The three gents arrive. They speak to me. Explain to them that    a lady traveller, Mme. Mergy, is going on to Genoa, to the    Hôtel Continental. The gents hesitate. M. Nicole wants to get    out. The others hold him back. The train starts. Good luck,    gents! An hour later, I take the train for France and get out    at Nice, to await fresh orders.”Jacob closed his note-book and concluded:“That’s all. To-day’s doings will be entered this evening.”“You can enter them now, M. Jacob. ‘12 noon. M. Daubrecq sends meto the Wagon-Lits Co. I book two berths in the Paris sleeping-car,by the 2.48 train, and send them to M. Daubrecq by expressmessenger. Then I take the 12.58 train for Vintimille, thefrontier-station, where I spend the day on the platform watchingall the travellers who come to France. Should Messrs. Nicole,Growler and Masher take it into their heads to leave Italy andreturn to Paris by way of Nice, my instructions are to telegraph tothe headquarters of police that Master Arsène Lupin and two of hisaccomplices are in train number so-and-so.”While speaking, Daubrecq led Jacob to the door. He closed it afterhim, turned the key, pushed the bolt and, going up to Clarisse,said:“And now, _darling_, listen to me.”This time, she uttered no protest. What could she do against suchan enemy, so powerful, so resourceful, who provided for everything,down to the minutest details, and who toyed with his adversaries insuch an airy fashion? Even if she had hoped till then for Lupin’sinterference, how could she do so now, when he was wanderingthrough Italy in pursuit of a shadow?She understood at last why three telegrams which she had sent tothe Hôtel Franklin had remained unanswered. Daubrecq was there,lurking in the dark, watching, establishing a void around her,separating her from her comrades in the fight, bringing hergradually, a beaten prisoner, within the four walls of that room.She felt her weakness. She was at the monster’s mercy. She must besilent and resigned.He repeated, with an evil delight:“Listen to me, darling. Listen to the irrevocable words which Iam about to speak. Listen to them well. It is now 12 o’clock. Thelast train starts at 2.48: you understand, the last train that canbring me to Paris to-morrow, Monday, in time to save your son. Theevening-trains would arrive too late. The _trains-de-luxe_ are fullup. Therefore I shall have to start at 2.48. Am I to start?”“Yes.”“Our berths are booked. Will you come with me?”“Yes.”“You know my conditions for interfering?”“Yes.”“Do you accept them?”“Yes.”“You will marry me?”“Yes.”Oh, those horrible answers! The unhappy woman gave them in asort of awful torpor, refusing even to understand what she waspromising. Let him start first, let him snatch Gilbert from theengine of death whose vision haunted her day and night.... Andthen . . . and then . . . let what must come come....He burst out laughing:“Oh, you rogue, it’s easily said!... You’re ready to pledgeyourself to anything, eh? The great thing is to save Gilbert,isn’t it? Afterward, when that noodle of a Daubrecq comes with hisengagement-ring, not a bit of it! Nothing doing! We’ll laugh in hisface!... No, no, enough of empty words. I don’t want promises thatwon’t be kept: I want facts, immediate facts.”He came and sat close beside her and stated, plainly:“This is what I propose . . . what must be . . . what shall be....I will ask, or rather I will demand, not Gilbert’s pardon, tobegin with, but a reprieve, a postponement of the execution, apostponement of three or four weeks. They will invent a pretext ofsome sort: that’s not my affair. And, when Mme. Mergy has becomeMme. Daubrecq, then and not till then will I ask for his pardon,that is to say, the commutation of his sentence. And make yourselfquite easy: they’ll grant it.”“I accept.... I accept,” she stammered.He laughed once more:“Yes, you accept, because that will happen in a month’s time . . .and meanwhile you reckon on finding some trick, an assistance ofsome kind or another . . . M. Arsène Lupin....”“I swear it on the head of my son.”“The head of your son!... Why, my poor pet, you would sell yourselfto the devil to save it from falling!...”“Oh, yes,” she whispered, shuddering. “I would gladly sell my soul!”He sidled up against her and, in a low voice:“Clarisse, it’s not your soul I ask for.... It’s something else....For more than twenty years my life has spun around that longing.You are the only woman I have ever loved.... Loathe me, hate me--Idon’t care--but do not spurn me.... Am I to wait? To wait anothermonth?... No, Clarisse, I have waited too many years already....”He ventured to touch her hand. Clarisse shrank back with suchdisgust that he was seized with fury and cried:“Oh, I swear to heaven, my beauty, the executioner won’t stand onsuch ceremony when he catches hold of your son!... And you giveyourself airs! Why, think, it’ll happen in forty hours! Fortyhours, no more, and you hesitate . . . and you have scruples, whenyour son’s life is at stake! Come, come, no whimpering, no sillysentimentality.... Look things in the face. By your own oath,you are my wife, you are my bride from this moment.... Clarisse,Clarisse, give me your lips....”Half-fainting, she had hardly the strength to put out her arm andpush him away; and, with a cynicism in which all his abominablenature stood revealed, Daubrecq, mingling words of cruelty andwords of passion, continued:“Save your son!... Think of the last morning: the preparations forthe scaffold, when they snip away his shirt and cut his hair....Clarisse, Clarisse, I will save him.... Be sure of it.... All mylife shall be yours.... Clarisse....”She no longer resisted. It was over. The loathsome brute’s lipswere about to touch hers; and it had to be, and nothing couldprevent it. It was her duty to obey the decree of fate. She hadlong known it. She understood it; and, closing her eyes, so as notto see the foul face that was slowly raised to hers, she repeatedto herself:“My son . . . my poor son.”A few seconds passed: ten, twenty perhaps. Daubrecq did not move.Daubrecq did not speak. And she was astounded at that great silenceand that sudden quiet. Did the monster, at the last moment, feel ascruple of remorse?She raised her eyelids.[Illustration: The sight which she beheld struck her withstupefaction.]The sight which she beheld struck her with stupefaction. Insteadof the grinning features which she expected to see, she saw amotionless, unrecognizable face, contorted by an expression ofunspeakable terror: and the eyes, invisible under the doubleimpediment of the spectacles, seemed to be staring above her head,above the chair in which she lay prostrate.Clarisse turned her face. Two revolver-barrels, pointed atDaubrecq, showed on the right, a little above the chair. She sawonly that: those two huge, formidable revolvers, gripped in twoclenched hands. She saw only that and also Daubrecq’s face, whichfear was discolouring little by little, until it turned livid. And,almost at the same time, some one slipped behind Daubrecq, sprangup fiercely, flung one of his arms round Daubrecq’s neck, threwhim to the ground with incredible violence and applied a pad ofcotton-wool to his face. A sudden smell of chloroform filled theroom.Clarisse had recognized M. Nicole.“Come along, Growler!” he cried. “Come along, Masher! Drop yourshooters: I’ve got him! He’s a limp rag.... Tie him up.”Daubrecq, in fact, was bending in two and falling on his knees likea disjointed doll. Under the action of the chloroform, the fearsomebrute sank into impotence, became harmless and grotesque.The Growler and the Masher rolled him in one of the blankets of thebed and tied him up securely.“That’s it! That’s it!” shouted Lupin, leaping to his feet.And, in a sudden reaction of mad delight, he began to dance a wildjig in the middle of the room, a jig mingled with bits of can-canand the contortions of the cakewalk and the whirls of a dancingdervish and the acrobatic movements of a clown and the lurchingsteps of a drunken man. And he announced, as though they were thenumbers in a music-hall performance:“The prisoner’s dance!... The captive’s hornpipe!... A _fantasia_on the corpse of a representative of the people!... The chloroformpolka!... The two-step of the conquered goggles! _Ollé! Ollé!_ Theblackmailer’s fandango! Hoot! Hoot! The McDaubrecq’s fling!... Theturkey trot!... _And_ the bunny hug!... _And_ the grizzly bear!...The Tyrolean dance: tra-la-liety!... _Allons, enfants de lapartie!_.... Zing, boum, boum! Zing, boum, boum!...”All his street-arab nature, all his instincts of gaiety, so longsuppressed by his constant anxiety and disappointment, came out andbetrayed themselves in roars of laughter, bursts of animal spiritsand a picturesque need of childlike exuberance and riot.He gave a last high kick, turned a series of cartwheels round theroom and ended by standing with his hands on his hips and one footon Daubrecq’s lifeless body.“An allegorical _tableau_!” he announced. “The angel of virtuedestroying the hydra of vice!”And the humour of the scene was twice as great because Lupin wasappearing under the aspect of M. Nicole, in the clothes and figureof that wizened, awkward, nervous private tutor.A sad smile flickered across Mme. Mergy’s face, her first smile formany a long month. But, at once returning to the reality of things,she besought him:“Please, please . . . think of Gilbert!”He ran up to her, caught her in his arms and, obeying a spontaneousimpulse, so frank that she could but laugh at it, gave her aresounding kiss on either cheek:“There, lady, that’s the kiss of a decent man! Instead of Daubrecq,it’s I kissing you.... Another word and I’ll do it again . . . andI’ll call you darling next.... Be angry with me, if you dare. Oh,how happy I am!”He knelt before her on one knee. And, respectfully:“I beg your pardon, madame. The fit is over.”And, getting up again, resuming his whimsical manner, he continued,while Clarisse wondered what he was driving at:“What’s the next article, madame? Your son’s pardon, perhaps?Certainly! Madame, I have the honour to grant you the pardon ofyour son, the commutation of his sentence to penal servitude forlife and, to wind up with, his early escape. It’s settled, eh,Growler? Settled, Masher, what? You’ll both go with the boy to NewCaledonia and arrange for everything. Oh, my dear Daubrecq, we oweyou a great debt! But I’m not forgetting you, believe me! Whatwould you like? A last pipe? Coming, coming!”He took one of the pipes from the mantel-piece, stooped over theprisoner, shifted his pad and thrust the amber mouth-piece betweenhis teeth:“Draw, old chap, draw. Lord, how funny you look, with your plugover your nose and your cutty in your mouth. Come, puff away.By Jove, I forgot to fill your pipe! Where’s your tobacco, yourfavourite Maryland?... Oh, here we are!...”He took from the chimney an unopened yellow packet and tore off thegovernment band:“His lordship’s tobacco! Ladies and gentlemen, keep your eyes onme! This is a great moment. I am about to fill his lordship’s pipe:by Jupiter, what an honour! Observe my movements! You see, I havenothing in my hands, nothing up my sleeves!...”He turned back his cuffs and stuck out his elbows. Then he openedthe packet and inserted his thumb and fore-finger, slowly,gingerly, like a conjurer performing a sleight-of-hand trick beforea puzzled audience, and, beaming all over his face, extractedfrom the tobacco a glittering object which he held out before thespectators.Clarisse uttered a cry.It was the crystal stopper.She rushed at Lupin and snatched it from him:“That’s it; that’s the one!” she exclaimed, feverishly. “There’s noscratch on the stem! And look at this line running down the middle,where the gilt finishes.... That’s it; it unscrews!... Oh, dear,my strength’s going!...” She trembled so violently that Lupin tookback the stopper and unscrewed it himself.The inside of the knob was hollow; and in the hollow space was apiece of paper rolled into a tiny pellet.“The foreign-post-paper,” he whispered, himself greatly excited,with quivering hands.There was a long silence. All four felt as if their hearts wereready to burst from their bodies; and they were afraid of what wascoming.“Please, please . . .” stammered Clarisse.Lupin unfolded the paper.There was a set of names written one below the other, twenty-sevenof them, the twenty-seven names of the famous list: Langeroux,Dechaumont, Vorenglade, d’Albufex, Victorien Mergy and the rest.And, at the foot, the signature of the chairman of the Two-SeasCanal Company, the signature written in letters of blood.Lupin looked at his watch:“A quarter to one,” he said. “We have twenty minutes to spare.Let’s have some lunch.”“But,” said Clarisse, who was already beginning to lose her head,“don’t forget....”He simply said:“All I know is that I’m dying of hunger.”He sat down at the table, cut himself a large slice of cold pie andsaid to his accomplices:“Growler? A bite? You, Masher?”“I could do with a mouthful, governor.”“Then hurry up, lads. And a glass of champagne to wash it downwith: it’s the chloroform-patient’s treat. Your health, Daubrecq!Sweet champagne? Dry champagne? Extra-dry?”']"
83,13,Chapter 13,"['XI.THE CROSS OF LORRAINEThe moment Lupin had finished lunch, he at once and, so to speak,without transition, recovered all his mastery and authority. Thetime for joking was past; and he must no longer yield to his loveof astonishing people with claptrap and conjuring tricks. Now thathe had discovered the crystal stopper in the hiding-place which hehad guessed with absolute certainty, now that he possessed the listof the Twenty-seven, it became a question of playing off the lastgame of the rubber without delay.It was child’s play, no doubt, and what remained to be donepresented no difficulty. Nevertheless, it was essential that heshould perform these final actions with promptness, decision andinfallible perspicacity. The smallest blunder was irretrievable.Lupin knew this; but his strangely lucid brain had allowed forevery contingency. And the movements and words which he was nowabout to make and utter were all fully prepared and matured:“Growler, the commissionaire is waiting on the Boulevard Gambettawith his barrow and the trunk which we bought. Bring him here andhave the trunk carried up. If the people of the hotel ask anyquestions, say it’s for the lady in No. 130.”Then, addressing his other companion:“Masher, go back to the station and take over the limousine. Theprice is arranged: ten thousand francs. Buy a chauffeur’s cap andovercoat and bring the car to the hotel.”“The money, governor.”Lupin opened a pocketbook which had been removed from Daubrecq’sjacket and produced a huge bundle of bank-notes. He separated tenof them:“Here you are. Our friend appears to have been doing well at theclub. Off with you, Masher!”The two men went out through Clarisse’s room. Lupin availed himselfof a moment when Clarisse Mergy was not looking to stow away thepocketbook with the greatest satisfaction:“I shall have done a fair stroke of business,” he said to himself.“When all the expenses are paid, I shall still be well to the good;and it’s not over yet.”Then turning to Clarisse Mergy, he asked:“Have you a bag?”“Yes, I bought one when I reached Nice, with some linen and a fewnecessaries; for I left Paris unprepared.”“Get all that ready. Then go down to the office. Say that you areexpecting a trunk which a commissionaire is bringing from thestation cloakroom and that you will want to unpack and pack itagain in your room; and tell them that you are leaving.”When alone, Lupin examined Daubrecq carefully, felt in all hispockets and appropriated everything that seemed to present any sortof interest.The Growler was the first to return. The trunk, a large wickerhamper covered with black moleskin, was taken into Clarisse’s room.Assisted by Clarisse and the Growler, Lupin moved Daubrecq and puthim in the trunk, in a sitting posture, but with his head bent soas to allow of the lid being fastened:“I don’t say that it’s as comfortable as your berth in asleeping-car, my dear deputy,” Lupin observed. “But, all the same,it’s better than a coffin. At least, you can breathe. Three littleholes in each side. You have nothing to complain of!”Then, unstopping a flask:“A drop more chloroform? You seem to love it!...”He soaked the pad once more, while, by his orders, Clarisse and theGrowler propped up the deputy with linen, rugs and pillows, whichthey had taken the precaution to heap in the trunk.“Capital!” said Lupin. “That trunk is fit to go round the world.Lock it and strap it.”The Masher arrived, in a chauffeur’s livery:“The car’s below, governor.”“Good,” he said. “Take the trunk down between you. It would bedangerous to give it to the hotel-servants.”“But if any one meets us?”“Well, what then, Masher? Aren’t you a chauffeur? You’re carryingthe trunk of your employer here present, the lady in No. 130, whowill also go down, step into her motor . . . and wait for me twohundred yards farther on. Growler, you help to hoist the trunk up.Oh, first lock the partition-door!”Lupin went to the next room, closed the other door, shot the bolt,walked out, locked the door behind him and went down in the lift.In the office, he said:“M. Daubrecq has suddenly been called away to Monte Carlo. He askedme to say that he would not be back until Tuesday and that you wereto keep his room for him. His things are all there. Here is thekey.”He walked away quietly and went after the car, where he foundClarisse lamenting:“We shall never be in Paris to-morrow! It’s madness! The leastbreakdown....”“That’s why you and I are going to take the train. It’s safer....”He put her into a cab and gave his parting instructions to the twomen:“Thirty miles an hour, on the average, do you understand? You’reto drive and rest, turn and turn about. At that rate, you oughtto be in Paris between six and seven to-morrow evening. But don’tforce the pace. I’m keeping Daubrecq, not because I want him formy plans, but as a hostage . . . and then by way of precaution....I like to feel that I can lay my hands on him during the next fewdays. So look after the dear fellow.... Give him a few drops ofchloroform every three or four hours: it’s his one weakness.... Offwith you, Masher.... And you, Daubrecq, don’t get excited up there.The roof’ll bear you all right.... If you feel at all sick, don’tmind... Off you go, Masher!”He watched the car move into the distance and then told the cabmanto drive to a post-office, where he dispatched a telegram in thesewords:  “_M. Prasville, Prefecture de Police, Paris_:    “Person found. Will bring you document eleven o’clock to-morrow    morning. Urgent communication.  “CLARISSE.”Clarisse and Lupin reached the station by half-past two.“If only there’s room!” said Clarisse, who was alarmed at the leastthing.“Room? Why, our berths are booked!”“By whom?”“By Jacob . . . by Daubrecq.”“How?”“Why, at the office of the hotel they gave me a letter which hadcome for Daubrecq by express. It was the two berths which Jacobhad sent him. Also, I have his deputy’s pass. So we shall travelunder the name of M. and Mme. Daubrecq and we shall receive all theattention due to our rank and station. You see, my dear madam, thateverything’s arranged.”The journey, this time, seemed short to Lupin. Clarisse told himwhat she had done during the past few days. He himself explainedthe miracle of his sudden appearance in Daubrecq’s bedroom at themoment when his adversary believed him in Italy:“A miracle, no,” he said. “But still a remarkable phenomenon tookplace in me when I left San Remo, a sort of mysterious intuitionwhich prompted me first to try and jump out of the train--and theMasher prevented me--and next to rush to the window, let down theglass and follow the porter of the Ambassadeurs-Palace, who hadgiven me your message, with my eyes. Well, at that very minute,the porter aforesaid was rubbing his hands with an air of suchsatisfaction that, for no other reason, suddenly, I understoodeverything: I had been diddled, taken in by Daubrecq, as youyourself were. Heaps of little details flashed across my mind. Myadversary’s scheme became clear to me from start to finish. Anotherminute . . . and the disaster would have been beyond remedy. I had,I confess, a few moments of real despair, at the thought that Ishould not be able to repair all the mistakes that had been made.It depended simply on the time-table of the trains, which wouldeither allow me or would not allow me to find Daubrecq’s emissaryon the railway-platform at San Remo. This time, at last, chancefavoured me. We had hardly alighted at the first station when atrain passed, for France. When we arrived at San Remo, the man wasthere. I had guessed right. He no longer wore his hotel-porter’scap and frock-coat, but a jacket and bowler. He stepped into asecond-class compartment. From that moment, victory was assured.”“But . . . how...?” asked Clarisse, who, in spite of the thoughtsthat obsessed her, was interested in Lupin’s story.“How did I find you? Lord, simply by not losing sight of MasterJacob, while leaving him free to move about as he pleased, knowingthat he was bound to account for his actions to Daubrecq. In pointof fact, this morning, after spending the night in a small hotelat Nice, he met Daubrecq on the Promenade des Anglais. They talkedfor some time. I followed them. Daubrecq went back to the hotel,planted Jacob in one of the passages on the ground-floor, oppositethe telephone-office, and went up in the lift. Ten minutes later Iknew the number of his room and knew that a lady had been occupyingthe next room, No. 130, since the day before. ‘I believe we’ve doneit,’ I said to the Growler and the Masher. I tapped lightly at yourdoor. No answer. And the door was locked.”“Well?” asked Clarisse.“Well, we opened it. Do you think there’s only one key in the worldthat will work a lock? So I walked in. Nobody in your room. But thepartition-door was ajar. I slipped through it. Thenceforth, a merehanging separated me from you, from Daubrecq and from the packet oftobacco which I saw on the chimney-slab.”“Then you knew the hiding-place?”“A look round Daubrecq’s study in Paris showed me that that packetof tobacco had disappeared. Besides....”“What?”“I knew, from certain confessions wrung from Daubrecq in theLovers’ Tower, that the word Marie held the key to the riddle.Since then I had certainly thought of this word, but with thepreconceived notion that it was spelt M A R I E. Well, it wasreally the first two syllables of another word, which I guessed, soto speak, only at the moment when I was struck by the absence ofthe packet of tobacco.”“What word do you mean?”“Maryland, Maryland tobacco, the only tobacco that Daubrecq smokes.”And Lupin began to laugh:“Wasn’t it silly? And, at the same time, wasn’t it clever ofDaubrecq? We looked everywhere, we ransacked everything. Didn’t Iunscrew the brass sockets of the electric lights to see if theycontained a crystal stopper? But how could I have thought, howcould any one, however great his perspicacity, have thought oftearing off the paper band of a packet of Maryland, a band put on,gummed, sealed, stamped and dated by the State, under the controlof the Inland Revenue Office? Only think! The State the accompliceof such an act of infamy! The Inland R-r-r-revenue Awfice lendingitself to such a trick! No, a thousand times no! The Régie[E] isnot perfect. It makes matches that won’t light and cigarettesfilled with hay. But there’s all the difference in the worldbetween recognizing that fact and believing the Inland Revenue tobe in league with Daubrecq with the object of hiding the list ofthe Twenty-seven from the legitimate curiosity of the governmentand the enterprising efforts of Arsène Lupin! Observe that allDaubrecq had to do, in order to introduce the crystal stopper, wasto bear upon the band a little, loosen it, draw it back, unfold theyellow paper, remove the tobacco and fasten it up again. Observealso that all we had to do, in Paris, was to take the packet inour hands and examine it, in order to discover the hiding-place.No matter! The packet itself, the plug of Maryland made up andpassed by the State and by the Inland Revenue Office, was a sacred,intangible thing, a thing above suspicion! And nobody opened it.That was how that demon of a Daubrecq allowed that untouched packetof tobacco to lie about for months on his table, among his pipesand among other unopened packets of tobacco. And no power on earthcould have given any one even the vaguest notion of looking intothat harmless little cube. I would have you observe, besides....”Lupin went on pursuing his remarks relative to the packet ofMaryland and the crystal stopper. His adversary’s ingenuity andshrewdness interested him all the more inasmuch as Lupin had endedby getting the better of him. But to Clarisse these topics matteredmuch less than did her anxiety as to the acts which must beperformed to save her son; and she sat wrapped in her own thoughtsand hardly listened to him.“Are you sure,” she kept on repeating, “that you will succeed?”“Absolutely sure.”“But Prasville is not in Paris.”“If he’s not there, he’s at the Havre. I saw it in the paperyesterday. In any case, a telegram will bring him to Paris at once.”“And do you think that he has enough influence?”“To obtain the pardon of Vaucheray and Gilbert personally. No.If he had, we should have set him to work before now. But he isintelligent enough to understand the value of what we are bringinghim and to act without a moment’s delay.”“But, to be accurate, are you not deceived as to that value?”“Was Daubrecq deceived? Was Daubrecq not in a better position thanany of us to know the full power of that paper? Did he not havetwenty proofs of it, each more convincing than the last? Think ofall that he was able to do, for the sole reason that people knewhim to possess the list. They knew it; and that was all. He didnot use the list, but he had it. And, having it, he killed yourhusband. He built up his fortune on the ruin and the disgrace ofthe Twenty-seven. Only last week, one of the gamest of the lot,d’Albufex, cut his throat in a prison. No, take it from me, asthe price of handing over that list, we could ask for anything wepleased. And we are asking for what? Almost nothing . . . less thannothing . . . the pardon of a child of twenty. In other words, theywill take us for idiots. What! We have in our hands....”He stopped. Clarisse, exhausted by so much excitement, sat fastasleep in front of him.They reached Paris at eight o’clock in the morning.Lupin found two telegrams awaiting him at his flat in the Place deClichy.One was from the Masher, dispatched from Avignon on the previousday and stating that all was going well and that they hoped tokeep their appointment punctually that evening. The other was fromPrasville, dated from the Havre and addressed to Clarisse:    “Impossible return to-morrow Monday morning. Come to my office    five o’clock. Reckon on you absolutely.”“Five o’clock!” said Clarisse. “How late!”“It’s a first-rate hour,” declared Lupin.“Still, if....”“If the execution is to take place to-morrow morning: is that whatyou mean to say?... Don’t be afraid to speak out, for the executionwill not take place.”“The newspapers....”“You haven’t read the newspapers and you are not to read them.Nothing that they can say matters in the least. One thing alonematters: our interview with Prasville. Besides....”He took a little bottle from a cupboard and, putting his hand onClarisse’s shoulder, said:“Lie down here, on the sofa, and take a few drops of this mixture.”“What’s it for?”“It will make you sleep for a few hours . . . and forget. That’salways so much gained.”“No, no,” protested Clarisse, “I don’t want to. Gilbert is notasleep. He is not forgetting.”“Drink it,” said Lupin, with gentle insistence. She yielded all ofa sudden, from cowardice, from excessive suffering, and did as shewas told and lay on the sofa and closed her eyes. In a few minutesshe was asleep.Lupin rang for his servant:“The newspapers . . . quick!... Have you bought them?”“Here they are, governor.”Lupin opened one of them and at once read the following lines:  “ARSENE LUPIN’S ACCOMPLICES”    “We know from a positive source that Arsène Lupin’s accomplices,    Gilbert and Vaucheray, will be executed to-morrow, Tuesday,    morning. M. Deibler has inspected the scaffold. Everything is    ready.”He raised his head with a defiant look.“Arsène Lupin’s accomplices! The execution of Arsène Lupin’saccomplices! What a fine spectacle! And what a crowd there will beto witness it! Sorry, gentlemen, but the curtain will not rise.Theatre closed by order of the authorities. And the authorities aremyself!”He struck his chest violently, with an arrogant gesture:“The authorities are myself!”At twelve o’clock Lupin received a telegram which the Masher hadsent from Lyons:    “All well. Goods will arrive without damage.”At three o’clock Clarisse woke. Her first words were:“Is it to be to-morrow?”He did not answer. But she saw him look so calm and smiling thatshe felt herself permeated with an immense sense of peace andreceived the impression that everything was finished, disentangled,settled according to her companion’s will.They left the house at ten minutes past four. Prasville’ssecretary, who had received his chief’s instructions by telephone,showed them into the office and asked them to wait. It was aquarter to five.Prasville came running in at five o’clock exactly and, at once,cried:“Have you the list?”“Yes.”“Give it me.”He put out his hand. Clarisse, who had risen from her chair, didnot stir.Prasville looked at her for a moment, hesitated and sat down. Heunderstood. In pursuing Daubrecq, Clarisse Mergy had not acted onlyfrom hatred and the desire for revenge. Another motive promptedher. The paper would not be handed over except upon conditions.“Sit down, please,” he said, thus showing that he accepted thediscussion.Clarisse resumed her seat and, when she remained silent, Prasvillesaid:“Speak, my friend, and speak quite frankly. I do not scruple to saythat we wish to have that paper.”“If it is only a wish,” remarked Clarisse, whom Lupin had coachedin her part down to the least detail, “if it is only a wish, I fearthat we shall not be able to come to an arrangement.”Prasville smiled:“The wish, obviously, would lead us to make certain sacrifices.”“Every sacrifice,” said Mme. Mergy, correcting him.“Every sacrifice, provided, of course, that we keep within thebounds of acceptable requirements.”“And even if we go beyond those bounds,” said Clarisse, inflexibly.Prasville began to lose patience:“Come, what is it all about? Explain yourself.”“Forgive me, my friend, but I wanted above all to mark thegreat importance which you attach to that paper and, in view ofthe immediate transaction which we are about to conclude, tospecify--what shall I say?--the value of my share in it. Thatvalue, which has no limits, must, I repeat, be exchanged for anunlimited value.”“Agreed,” said Prasville, querulously.“I presume, therefore, that it is unnecessary for me to trace thewhole story of the business or to enumerate, on the one hand, thedisasters which the possession of that paper would have allowed youto avert and, on the other hand, the incalculable advantages whichyou will be able to derive from its possession?”Prasville had to make an effort to contain himself and to answer ina tone that was civil, or nearly so:“I admit everything. Is that enough?”“I beg your pardon, but we cannot explain ourselves too plainly.And there is one point that remains to be cleared up. Are you in aposition to treat, personally?”“How do you mean?”“I want to know not, of course, if you are empowered to settle thisbusiness here and now, but if, in dealing with me, you representthe views of those who know the business and who are qualified tosettle it.”“Yes,” declared Prasville, forcibly.“So that I can have your answer within an hour after I have toldyou my conditions?”“Yes.”“Will the answer be that of the government?”“Yes.”Clarisse bent forward and, sinking her voice:“Will the answer be that of the Élysée?”Prasville appeared surprised. He reflected for a moment and thensaid:“Yes.”“It only remains for me to ask you to give me your word of honourthat, however incomprehensible my conditions may appear to you, youwill not insist on my revealing the reason. They are what they are.Your answer must be yes or no.”“I give you my word of honour,” said Prasville, formally.Clarisse underwent a momentary agitation that made her turn palerstill. Then, mastering herself, with her eyes fixed on Prasville’seyes, she said:“You shall have the list of the Twenty-seven in exchange for thepardon of Gilbert and Vaucheray.”“Eh? What?”Prasville leapt from his chair, looking absolutely dumbfounded:“The pardon of Gilbert and Vaucheray? Of Arsène Lupin’saccomplices?”“Yes,” she said.“The murderers of the Villa Marie-Thérèse? The two who are due todie to-morrow?”“Yes, those two,” she said, in a loud voice. “I ask? I demand theirpardon.”“But this is madness! Why? Why should you?”“I must remind you, Prasville, that you gave me your word....”“Yes . . . yes.... I know.... But the thing is so unexpected....”“Why?”“Why? For all sorts of reasons!”“What reasons?”“Well . . . well, but . . . think! Gilbert and Vaucheray have beensentenced to death!”“Send them to penal servitude: that’s all you have to do.”“Impossible! The case has created an enormous sensation. Theyare Arsène Lupin’s accomplices. The whole world knows about theverdict.”“Well?”“Well, we cannot, no, we cannot go against the decrees of justice.”“You are not asked to do that. You are asked for a commutation ofpunishment as an act of mercy. Mercy is a legal thing.”“The pardoning-commission has given its finding....”“True, but there remains the president of the Republic.”“He has refused.”“He can reconsider his refusal.”“Impossible!”“Why?”“There’s no excuse for it.”“He needs no excuse. The right of mercy is absolute. It isexercised without control, without reason, without excuse orexplanation. It is a _royal_ prerogative; the president of theRepublic can wield it according to his good pleasure, or ratheraccording to his conscience, in the best interests of the State.”“But it is too late! Everything is ready. The execution is to takeplace in a few hours.”“One hour is long enough to obtain your answer; you have just toldus so.”“But this is confounded madness! There are insuperable obstaclesto your conditions. I tell you again, it’s impossible, physicallyimpossible.”“Then the answer is no?”“No! No! A thousand times no!”“In that case, there is nothing left for us to do but to go.”She moved toward the door. M. Nicole followed her. Prasvillebounded across the room and barred their way:“Where are you going?”“Well, my friend, it seems to me that our conversation is at anend. As you appear to think, as, in fact, you are certain that thepresident of the Republic will not consider the famous list of theTwenty-seven to be worth....”“Stay where you are,” said Prasville.He turned the key in the door and began to pace the room, with hishands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the floor.And Lupin, who had not breathed a word during the whole of thisscene and who had prudently contented himself with playing acolourless part, said to himself:“What a fuss! What a lot of affectation to arrive at the inevitableresult! As though Prasville, who is not a genius, but not anabsolute blockhead either, would be likely to lose the chance ofrevenging himself on his mortal enemy! There, what did I say? Theidea of hurling Daubrecq into the bottomless pit appeals to him.Come, we’ve won the rubber.”Prasville was opening a small inner door which led to the office ofhis private secretary.He gave an order aloud:“M. Lartigue, telephone to the Élysée and say that I request thefavour of an audience for a communication of the utmost importance.”He closed the door, came back to Clarisse and said:“In any case, my intervention is limited to submitting yourproposal.”“Once you submit it, it will be accepted.”A long silence followed. Clarisse’s features expressed so profounda delight that Prasville was struck by it and looked at her withattentive curiosity. For what mysterious reason did Clarisse wishto save Gilbert and Vaucheray? What was the incomprehensible linkthat bound her to those two men? What tragedy connected those threelives and, no doubt, Daubrecq’s in addition?“Go ahead, old boy,” thought Lupin, “cudgel your brains: you’llnever spot it! Ah, if we had asked for Gilbert’s pardon only, asClarisse wished, you might have twigged the secret! But Vaucheray,that brute of a Vaucheray, there really could not be the leastbond between Mme. Mergy and him..... Aha, by Jingo, it’s my turnnow!... He’s watching me.... The inward soliloquy is turningupon myself.... ‘I wonder who that M. Nicole can be? Why hasthat little provincial usher devoted himself body and soul toClarisse Mergy? Who is that old bore, if the truth were known? Imade a mistake in not inquiring.... I must look into this.... Imust rip off the beggar’s mask. For, after all, it’s not naturalthat a man should take so much trouble about a matter in whichhe is not directly interested. Why should he also wish to saveGilbert and Vaucheray? Why? Why should he?...” Lupin turned hishead away. “Look out!... Look out!... There’s a notion passingthrough that red-tape-merchant’s skull: a confused notion whichhe can’t put into words. Hang it all, he mustn’t suspect M. Lupinunder M. Nicole! The thing’s complicated enough as it is, in allconscience!...”But there was a welcome interruption. Prasville’s secretary came tosay that the audience would take place in an hour’s time.“Very well. Thank you,” said Prasville. “That will do.”And, resuming the interview, with no further circumlocution,speaking like a man who means to put a thing through, he declared:“I think that we shall be able to manage it. But, first of all, sothat I may do what I have undertaken to do, I want more preciseinformation, fuller details. Where was the paper?”“In the crystal stopper, as we thought,” said Mme. Mergy.“And where was the crystal stopper?”“In an object which Daubrecq came and fetched, a few days ago, fromthe writing-desk in his study in the Square Lamartine, an objectwhich I took from him yesterday.”“What sort of object?”“Simply a packet of tobacco, Maryland tobacco, which used to lieabout on the desk.”Prasville was petrified. He muttered, guilelessly:“Oh, if I had only known! I’ve had my hand on that packet ofMaryland a dozen times! How stupid of me!”“What does it matter?” said Clarisse. “The great thing is that thediscovery is made.”Prasville pulled a face which implied that the discovery would havebeen much pleasanter if he himself had made it. Then he asked:“So you have the list?”“Yes.”“Show it to me.”And, when Clarisse hesitated, he added:“Oh, please, don’t be afraid! The list belongs to you, and I willgive it back to you. But you must understand that I cannot take thestep in question without making certain.”Clarisse consulted M. Nicole with a glance which did not escapePrasville. Then she said:“Here it is.”He seized the scrap of paper with a certain excitement, examined itand almost immediately said:“Yes, yes . . . the secretary’s writing: I recognize it.... And thesignature of the chairman of the company: the signature in red....Besides, I have other proofs.... For instance, the torn piece whichcompletes the left-hand top corner of this sheet....”He opened his safe and, from a special cash-box, produced a tinypiece of paper which he put against the top left corner:“That’s right. The torn edges fit exactly. The proof is undeniable.All that remains is to verify the make of this foreign-post-paper.”Clarisse was radiant with delight. No one would have believed thatthe most terrible torture had racked her for weeks and weeks andthat she was still bleeding and quivering from its effects.While Prasville was holding the paper against a window-pane, shesaid to Lupin:“I insist upon having Gilbert informed this evening. He must be soawfully unhappy!”“Yes,” said Lupin. “Besides, you can go to his lawyer and tell him.”She continued:“And then I must see Gilbert to-morrow. Prasville can think what helikes.”“Of course. But he must first gain his cause at the Élysée.”“There can’t be any difficulty, can there?”“No. You saw that he gave way at once.”Prasville continued his examination with the aid of amagnifying-glass and compared the sheet with the scrap of tornpaper. Next, he took from the cash-box some other sheets ofletter-paper and examined one of these by holding it up to thelight:“That’s done,” he said. “My mind is made up. Forgive me, dearfriend: it was a very difficult piece of work.... I passed throughvarious stages. When all is said, I had my suspicions . . . and notwithout cause....”“What do you mean?” asked Clarisse.“One second.... I must give an order first.”He called his secretary:“Please telephone at once to the Élysée, make my apologies and saythat I shall not require the audience, for reasons which I willexplain later.”He closed the door and returned to his desk. Clarisse and Lupinstood choking, looking at him in stupefaction, failing tounderstand this sudden change. Was he mad? Was it a trick on hispart? A breach of faith? And was he refusing to keep his promise,now that he possessed the list?He held it out to Clarisse:“You can have it back.”“Have it back?”“And return it to Daubrecq.”“To Daubrecq?”“Unless you prefer to burn it.”“What do you say?”“I say that, if I were in your place, I would burn it.”“Why do you say that? It’s ridiculous!”“On the contrary, it is very sensible.”“But why? Why?”“Why? I will tell you. The list of the Twenty-seven, as we knowfor absolutely certain, was written on a sheet of letter-paperbelonging to the chairman of the Canal Company, of which there area few samples in this cash-box. Now all these samples have as awater-mark a little cross of Lorraine which is almost invisible,but which can just be seen in the thickness of the paper when youhold it up to the light. The sheet which you have brought me doesnot contain that little cross of Lorraine.”[F]Lupin felt a nervous trembling shake him from head to foot and hedared not turn his eyes on Clarisse, realizing what a terrible blowthis was to her. He heard her stammer:“Then are we to suppose . . . that Daubrecq was taken in?”“Not a bit of it!” exclaimed Prasville. “It is you who have beentaken in, my poor friend. Daubrecq has the real list, the listwhich he stole from the dying man’s safe.”“But this one....”“This one is a forgery.”“A forgery?”“An undoubted forgery. It was an admirable piece of cunning onDaubrecq’s part. Dazzled by the crystal stopper which he flashedbefore your eyes, you did nothing but look for that stopper inwhich he had stowed away no matter what, the first bit of paperthat came to hand, while he quietly kept....”Prasville interrupted himself. Clarisse was walking up to him withshort, stiff steps, like an automaton. She said:“Then....”“Then what, dear friend?”“You refuse?”“Certainly, I am obliged to; I have no choice.”“You refuse to take that step?”“Look here, how can I do what you ask? It’s not possible, on thestrength of a valueless document....”“You won’t do it?... You won’t do it?... And, to-morrowmorning . . . in a few hours . . . Gilbert....”She was frightfully pale, her face sunk, like the face of onedying. Her eyes opened wider and wider and her teeth chattered....Lupin, fearing the useless and dangerous words which she was aboutto utter, seized her by the shoulders and tried to drag her away.But she thrust him back with indomitable strength, took two orthree more steps, staggered, as though on the point of falling,and, suddenly, in a burst of energy and despair, laid hold ofPrasville and screamed:“You shall go to the Élysée!... You shall go at once!... Youmust!... You must save Gilbert!”“Please, please, my dear friend, calm yourself....”She gave a strident laugh:“Calm myself!... When, to-morrow morning, Gilbert.... Ah, no, no,I am terrified . . . it’s appalling.... Oh, run, you wretch, run!Obtain his pardon!... Don’t you understand? Gilbert.... Gilbert ismy son! My son! My son!”Prasville gave a cry. The blade of a knife flashed in Clarisse’shand and she raised her arm to strike herself. But the movement wasnot completed. M. Nicole caught her arm in its descent and, takingthe knife from Clarisse, reducing her to helplessness, he said, ina voice that rang through the room like steel:“What you are doing is madness!... When I gave you my oath that Iwould save him! You must . . . live for him.... Gilbert shall notdie.... How can he die, when . . . I gave you my oath?...”“Gilbert . . . my son . . .” moaned Clarisse.He clasped her fiercely, drew her against himself and put his handover her mouth:“Enough! Be quiet!... I entreat you to be quiet.... Gilbert shallnot die....”With irresistible authority, he dragged her away like a subduedchild that suddenly becomes obedient; but, at the moment of openingthe door, he turned to Prasville:“Wait for me here, monsieur,” he commanded, in an imperative tone.“If you care about that list of the Twenty-seven, the real list,wait for me. I shall be back in an hour, in two hours, at most; andthen we will talk business.”And abruptly, to Clarisse:“And you, madame, a little courage yet. I command you to showcourage, in Gilbert’s name.”He went away, through the passages, down the stairs, with a jerkystep, holding Clarisse under the arm, as he might have held alay-figure, supporting her, carrying her almost. A court-yard,another court-yard, then the street.Meanwhile, Prasville, surprised at first, bewildered by the courseof events, was gradually recovering his composure and thinking.He thought of that M. Nicole, a mere supernumerary at first, whoplayed beside Clarisse the part of one of those advisers to whomwe cling in the serious crises of our lives and who suddenly,shaking off his torpor, appeared in the full light of day,resolute, masterful, mettlesome, brimming over with daring, readyto overthrow all the obstacles that fate placed on his path.Who was there that was capable of acting thus?Prasville started. The question had no sooner occurred to his mindthan the answer flashed on him, with absolute certainty. All theproofs rose up, each more exact, each more convincing than the last.Hurriedly he rang. Hurriedly he sent for the chiefdetective-inspector on duty. And, feverishly:“Were you in the waiting-room, chief-inspector?”“Yes, monsieur le secrétaire;-général.”“Did you see a gentleman and a lady go out?”“Yes.”“Would you know the man again?”“Yes.”“Then don’t lose a moment, chief-inspector. Take six inspectorswith you. Go to the Place de Clichy. Make inquiries about a mancalled Nicole and watch the house. The Nicole man is on his wayback there.”“And if he comes out, monsieur le secrétaire;-général?”“Arrest him. Here’s a warrant.”He sat down to his desk and wrote a name on a form:“Here you are, chief-inspector. I will let the chief-detectiveknow.”The chief-inspector seemed staggered:“But you spoke to me of a man called Nicole, monsieur lesecrétaire;-général.”“Well?”“The warrant is in the name of Arsène Lupin.”“Arsène Lupin and the Nicole man are one and the same individual.”[E] The department of the French excise which holds the monopolyfor the manufacture and sale of tobacco, cigars, cigarettes andmatches.--_Translator’s Note._[F] The cross of Lorraine is a cross with two horizontallines or bars across the upper half of the perpendicularbeam.--_Translator’s Note._']"
83,14,Chapter 14,"['XII.THE SCAFFOLD“I will save him, I will save him,” Lupin repeated, withoutceasing, in the taxicab in which he and Clarisse drove away. “Iswear that I will save him.”Clarisse did not listen, sat as though numbed, as though possessedby some great nightmare of death, which left her ignorant of allthat was happening outside her. And Lupin set forth his plans,perhaps more to reassure himself than to convince Clarisse:“No, no, the game is not lost yet. There is one trump left, ahuge trump, in the shape of the letters and documents whichVorenglade, the ex-deputy, is offering to sell to Daubrecq and ofwhich Daubrecq spoke to you yesterday at Nice. I shall buy thoseletters and documents of Stanislas Vorenglade at whatever price hechooses to name. Then we shall go back to the police-office and Ishall say to Prasville, ‘Go to the Élysée at once.... Use the listas though it were genuine, save Gilbert from death and be contentto acknowledge to-morrow, when Gilbert is saved, that the list isforged.... Be off, quickly!... If you refuse, well, if you refuse,the Vorenglade letters and documents shall be reproduced to-morrow,Tuesday, morning in one of the leading newspapers.’ Vorenglade willbe arrested. And M. Prasville will find himself in prison beforenight.’”Lupin rubbed his hands:“He’ll do as he’s told!... He’ll do as he’s told!... I felt thatat once, when I was with him. The thing appeared to me as adead certainty. And I found Vorenglade’s address in Daubrecq’spocket-books, so . . . driver, Boulevard Raspail!”They went to the address given. Lupin sprang from the cab, ran upthree flights of stairs.The servant said that M. Vorenglade was away and would not be backuntil dinner-time next evening.“And don’t you know where he is?”“M. Vorenglade is in London, sir.”Lupin did not utter a word on returning to the cab. Clarisse, onher side, did not even ask him any questions, so indifferent hadshe become to everything, so absolutely did she look upon her son’sdeath as an accomplished fact.They drove to the Place de Clichy. As Lupin entered the house hepassed two men who were just leaving the porter’s box. He was toomuch engrossed to notice them. They were Prasville’s inspectors.“No telegram?” he asked his servant.“No, governor,” replied Achille.“No news of the Masher and the Growler?”“No, governor, none.”“That’s all right,” he said to Clarisse, in a casual tone. “It’sonly seven o’clock and we mustn’t reckon on seeing them beforeeight or nine. Prasville will have to wait, that’s all. I willtelephone to him to wait.”He did so and was hanging up the receiver, when he heard a moanbehind him. Clarisse was standing by the table, reading anevening-paper. She put her hand to her heart, staggered and fell.“Achille, Achille!” cried Lupin, calling his man. “Help meput her on my bed.... And then go to the cupboard and get methe medicine-bottle marked number four, the bottle with thesleeping-draught.”He forced open her teeth with the point of a knife and compelledher to swallow half the bottle:“Good,” he said. “Now the poor thing won’t wake tillto-morrow . . . _after_.”He glanced through the paper, which was still clutched in Clarisse’hand, and read the following lines:    “The strictest measures have been taken to keep order at the    execution of Gilbert and Vaucheray, lest Arsène Lupin should    make an attempt to rescue his accomplices from the last    penalty. At twelve o’clock to-night a cordon of troops will    be drawn across all the approaches to the Santé Prison. As    already stated, the execution will take place outside the    prison-walls, in the square formed by the Boulevard Arago    and the Rue de la Santé.    “We have succeeded in obtaining some details of the attitude    of the two condemned men. Vaucheray observes a stolid sullenness    and is awaiting the fatal event with no little courage:    “‘Crikey,’ he says, ‘I can’t say I’m delighted; but I’ve got to    go through it and I shall keep my end up.’ And he adds, ‘Death    I don’t care a hang about! What worries me is the thought that    they’re going to cut my head off. Ah, if the governor could    only hit on some trick to send me straight off to the next    world before I had time to say knife! A drop of Prussic acid,    governor, if you please!’    “Gilbert’s calmness is even more impressive, especially when    we remember how he broke down at the trial. He retains an    unshaken confidence in the omnipotence of Arsène Lupin:    “‘The governor shouted to me before everybody not to be    afraid, that he was there, that he answered for everything.    Well, I’m not afraid. I shall rely on him until the last    day, until the last minute, at the very foot of the    scaffold. I know the governor! There’s no danger with him.    He has promised and he will keep his word. If my head were    off, he’d come and clap it on my shoulders and firmly!    Arsène Lupin allow his chum Gilbert to die? Not he! Excuse    my humour!’    “There is a certain touching frankness in all this enthusiasm    which is not without a dignity of its own. We shall see if    Arsène Lupin deserves the confidence so blindly placed in him.”Lupin was hardly able to finish reading the article for the tearsthat dimmed his eyes: tears of affection, tears of pity, tears ofdistress.No, he did not deserve the confidence of his chum Gilbert.Certainly, he had performed impossibilities; but there arecircumstances in which we must perform more than impossibilities,in which we must show ourselves stronger than fate; and, thistime, fate had been stronger than he. Ever since the first day andthroughout this lamentable adventure, events had gone contraryto his anticipations, contrary to logic itself. Clarisse and he,though pursuing an identical aim, had wasted weeks in fightingeach other. Then, at the moment when they were uniting theirefforts, a series of ghastly disasters had come one after theother: the kidnapping of little Jacques, Daubrecq’s disappearance,his imprisonment in the Lovers’ Tower, Lupin’s wound, his enforcedinactivity, followed by the cunning manoeuvres that draggedClarisse--and Lupin after her--to the south, to Italy. And then,as a crowning catastrophe, when, after prodigies of will-power,after miracles of perseverance, they were entitled to think thatthe Golden Fleece was won, it all came to nothing. The list of theTwenty-seven had no more value than the most insignificant scrap ofpaper.“The game’s up!” said Lupin. “It’s an absolute defeat. What if Ido revenge myself on Daubrecq, ruin him and destroy him? He is thereal victor, once Gilbert is going to die.”He wept anew, not with spite or rage, but with despair. Gilbert wasgoing to die! The lad whom he called his chum, the best of his palswould be gone for ever, in a few hours. He could not save him. Hewas at the end of his tether. He did not even look round for a lastexpedient. What was the use?And his persuasion of his own helplessness was so deep, so definitethat he felt no shock of any kind on receiving a telegram from theMasher that said:    “Motor accident. Essential part broken. Long repair. Arrive    to-morrow morning.”It was a last proof to show that fate had uttered its decree. He nolonger thought of rebelling against the decision.He looked at Clarisse. She was peacefully sleeping; and this totaloblivion, this absence of all consciousness, seemed to him soenviable that, suddenly yielding to a fit of cowardice, he seizedthe bottle, still half-filled with the sleeping-draught, and drankit down.Then he stretched himself on a couch and rang for his man:“Go to bed, Achille, and don’t wake me on any pretence whatever.”“Then there’s nothing to be done for Gilbert and Vaucheray,governor?” said Achille.“Nothing.”“Are they going through it?”“They are going through it.”Twenty minutes later Lupin fell into a heavy sleep. It was teno’clock in the evening.       *       *       *       *       *The night was full of incident and noise around the prison. At oneo’clock in the morning the Rue de la Santé, the Boulevard Arago andall the streets abutting on the gaol were guarded by police, whoallowed no one to pass without a regular cross-examination.For that matter, it was raining in torrents; and it seemed asthough the lovers of this sort of show would not be very numerous.The public-houses were all closed by special order. At four o’clockthree companies of infantry came and took up their positions alongthe pavements, while a battalion occupied the Boulevard Arago incase of a surprise. Municipal guards cantered up and down betweenthe lines; a whole staff of police-magistrates, officers andfunctionaries, brought together for the occasion, moved about amongthe troops.The guillotine was set up in silence, in the middle of the squareformed by the boulevard and the street; and the sinister sound ofhammering was heard.But, at five o’clock, the crowd gathered, notwithstanding the rain,and people began to sing. They shouted for the footlights, calledfor the curtain to rise, were exasperated to see that, at thedistance at which the barriers had been fixed, they could hardlydistinguish the uprights of the guillotine.Several carriages drove up, bringing official persons dressed inblack. There were cheers and hoots, whereupon a troop of mountedmunicipal guards scattered the groups and cleared the space toa distance of three hundred yards from the square. Two freshcompanies of soldiers lined up.And suddenly there was a great silence. A vague white light fellfrom the dark sky. The rain ceased abruptly.Inside the prison, at the end of the passage containing thecondemned cells, the men in black were conversing in low voices.Prasville was talking to the public prosecutor, who expressed hisfears:“No, no,” declared Prasville, “I assure you, it will pass withoutan incident of any kind.”“Do your reports mention nothing at all suspicious, monsieur lesecrétaire;-général?”“Nothing. And they can’t mention anything, for the simple reasonthat we have Lupin.”“Do you mean that?”“Yes, we know his hiding-place. The house where he lives, on thePlace de Clichy, and where he went at seven o’clock last night, issurrounded. Moreover, I know the scheme which he had contrived tosave his two accomplices. The scheme miscarried at the last moment.We have nothing to fear, therefore. The law will take its course.”Meanwhile, the hour had struck.They took Vaucheray first; and the governor of the prison orderedthe door of his cell to be opened. Vaucheray leapt out of bed andcast eyes dilated with terror upon the men who entered.“Vaucheray, we have come to tell you....”“Stow that, stow that,” he muttered. “No words. I know all aboutit. Get on with the business.”One would have thought that he was in a hurry for it to be overas fast as possible, so readily did he submit to the usualpreparations. But he would not allow any of them to speak to him:“No words,” he repeated. “What? Confess to the priest? Not worthwhile. I have shed blood. The law sheds my blood. It’s the good oldrule. We’re quits.”Nevertheless, he stopped short for a moment:“I say, is my mate going through it too?”And, when he heard that Gilbert would go to the scaffold at thesame time as himself, he had two or three seconds of hesitation,glanced at the bystanders, seemed about to speak, was silent and,at last, muttered:“It’s better so.... They’ll pull us through together . . . we’llclink glasses together.”Gilbert was not asleep either, when the men entered his cell.Sitting on his bed, he listened to the terrible words, tried tostand up, began to tremble frightfully, from head to foot, like askeleton when shaken, and then fell back, sobbing:“Oh, my poor mummy, poor mummy!” he stammered.They tried to question him about that mother, of whom he had neverspoken; but his tears were interrupted by a sudden fit of rebellionand he cried:“I have done no murder.... I won’t die. I have done no murder....”“Gilbert,” they said, “show yourself a man.”“Yes, yes . . . but I have done no murder.... Why should I die?”His teeth chattered so loudly that words which he uttered becameunintelligible. He let the men do their work, made his confession,heard mass and then, growing calmer and almost docile, with thevoice of a little child resigning itself, murmured:“Tell my mother that I beg her forgiveness.”“Your mother?”“Yes.... Put what I say in the papers.... She will understand....And then....”“What, Gilbert?”“Well, I want the governor to know that I have not lost confidence.”He gazed at the bystanders, one after the other, as though heentertained the mad hope that “the governor” was one of them,disguised beyond recognition and ready to carry him off in his arms:“Yes,” he said, gently and with a sort of religious piety, “yes, Istill have confidence, even at this moment.... Be sure and let himknow, won’t you?... I am positive that he will not let me die. I amcertain of it....”They guessed, from the fixed look in his eyes, that he saw Lupin,that he felt Lupin’s shadow prowling around and seeking an inletthrough which to get to him. And never was anything more touchingthan the sight of that stripling--clad in the strait-jacket,with his arms and legs bound, guarded by thousands of men--whomthe executioner already held in his inexorable hand and who,nevertheless, hoped on.Anguish wrung the hearts of all the beholders. Their eyes weredimmed with tears:“Poor little chap!” stammered some one.Prasville, touched like the rest and thinking of Clarisse,repeated, in a whisper:“Poor little chap!”But the hour struck, the preparations were finished. They set out.The two processions met in the passage. Vaucheray, on seeingGilbert, snapped out:“I say, kiddie, the governor’s chucked us!”And he added a sentence which nobody, save Prasville, was able tounderstand:“Expect he prefers to pocket the proceeds of the crystal stopper.”They went down the staircases. They crossed the prison-yards. Anendless, horrible distance.And, suddenly, in the frame of the great doorway, the wan light ofday, the rain, the street, the outlines of houses, while far-offsounds came through the awful silence.They walked along the wall, to the corner of the boulevard.A few steps farther Vaucheray started back: he had seen!Gilbert crept along, with lowered head, supported by anexecutioner’s assistant and by the chaplain, who made him kiss thecrucifix as he went.There stood the guillotine.“No, no,” shouted Gilbert, “I won’t.... I won’t.... Help! Help!”A last appeal, lost in space.The executioner gave a signal. Vaucheray was laid hold of, lifted,dragged along, almost at a run.And then came this staggering thing: a shot, a shot fired from theother side, from one of the houses opposite.The assistants stopped short.The burden which they were dragging had collapsed in their arms.“What is it? What’s happened?” asked everybody.“He’s wounded....”Blood spurted from Vaucheray’s forehead and covered his face.He spluttered:“That’s done it . . . one in a thousand! Thank you, governor, thankyou.”“Finish him off! Carry him there!” said a voice, amid the generalconfusion.“But he’s dead!”“Get on with it . . . finish him off!”Tumult was at its height, in the little group of magistrates,officials and policemen. Every one was giving orders:“Execute him!... The law must take its course!... We have no rightto delay! It would be cowardice!... Execute him!”“But the man’s dead!”“That makes no difference!... The law must be obeyed!... Executehim!”The chaplain protested, while two warders and Prasville kept theireyes on Gilbert. In the meantime, the assistants had taken up thecorpse again and were carrying it to the guillotine.“Hurry up!” cried the executioner, scared and hoarse-voiced. “Hurryup!... And the other one to follow.... Waste no time....”He had not finished speaking, when a second report rang out. Hespun round on his heels and fell, groaning:“It’s nothing . . . a wound in the shoulder.... Go on.... The nextone’s turn!”But his assistants were running away, yelling with terror. Thespace around the guillotine was cleared. And the prefect ofpolice, rallying his men, drove everybody back to the prison,helter-skelter, like a disordered rabble: the magistrates, theofficials, the condemned man, the chaplain, all who had passedthrough the archway two or three minutes before.In the meanwhile, a squad of policemen, detectives and soldierswere rushing upon the house, a little old-fashioned, three-storiedhouse, with a ground-floor occupied by two shops which happened tobe empty. Immediately after the first shot, they had seen, vaguely,at one of the windows on the second floor, a man holding a rifle inhis hand and surrounded with a cloud of smoke.Revolver-shots were fired at him, but missed him. He, standingcalmly on a table, took aim a second time, fired from the shoulder;and the crack of the second report was heard. Then he withdrew intothe room.Down below, as nobody answered the peal at the bell, the assailantsdemolished the door, which gave way almost immediately. Theymade for the staircase, but their onrush was at once stopped, onthe first floor, by an accumulation of beds, chairs and otherfurniture, forming a regular barricade and so close-entangled thatit took the aggressors four or five minutes to clear themselves apassage.Those four or five minutes lost were enough to render all pursuithopeless. When they reached the second floor they heard a voiceshouting from above:“This way, friends! Eighteen stairs more. A thousand apologies forgiving you so much trouble!”They ran up those eighteen stairs and nimbly at that! But, at thetop, above the third story, was the garret, which was reached by aladder and a trapdoor. And the fugitive had taken away the ladderand bolted the trapdoor.The reader will not have forgotten the sensation created bythis amazing action, the editions of the papers issued in quicksuccession, the newsboys tearing and shouting through the streets,the whole metropolis on edge with indignation and, we may say, withanxious curiosity.But it was at the headquarters of police that the excitementdeveloped into a paroxysm. Men flung themselves about on everyside. Messages, telegrams, telephone calls followed one upon theother.At last, at eleven o’clock in the morning, there was a meeting inthe office of the prefect of police, and Prasville was there. Thechief-detective read a report of his inquiry, the results of whichamounted to this: shortly before midnight yesterday some one hadrung at the house on the Boulevard Arago. The portress, who sleptin a small room on the ground-floor, behind one of the shops pulledthe rope. A man came and tapped at her door. He said that he hadcome from the police on an urgent matter concerning to-morrow’sexecution. The portress opened the door and was at once attacked,gagged and bound.Ten minutes later a lady and gentleman who lived on the first floorand who had just come home were also reduced to helplessness by thesame individual and locked up, each in one of the two empty shops.The third-floor tenant underwent a similar fate, but in his ownflat and his own bedroom, which the man was able to enter withoutbeing heard. The second floor was unoccupied, and the man took uphis quarters there. He was now master of the house.“And there we are!” said the prefect of police, beginning tolaugh, with a certain bitterness. “There we are! It’s as simple asshelling peas. Only, what surprises me is that he was able to getaway so easily.”“I will ask you to observe, monsieur le préfet, that, beingabsolute master of the house from one o’clock in the morning, hehad until five o’clock to prepare his flight.”“And that flight took place...?”“Over the roofs. At that spot the houses in the next street, theRue de la Glacière, are quite near and there is only one breakin the roofs, about three yards wide, with a drop of one yard inheight.”“Well?”“Well, our man had taken away the ladder leading to the garretand used it as a foot-bridge. After crossing to the next block ofbuildings, all he had to do was to look through the windows untilhe found an empty attic, enter one of the houses in the Rue de laGlacière and walk out quietly with his hands in his pockets. Inthis way his flight, duly prepared beforehand, was effected verysimply and without the least obstacle.”“But you had taken the necessary measures.”“Those which you ordered, monsieur le préfet. My men spent threehours last evening visiting all the houses, so as to make sure thatthere was no stranger hiding there. At the moment when they wereleaving the last house I had the street barred. Our man must haveslipped through during that few minutes’ interval.”“Capital! Capital! And there is no doubt in your minds, of course:it’s Arsène Lupin?”“Not a doubt. In the first place, it was all a question of hisaccomplices. And then . . . and then . . . no one but Arsène Lupinwas capable of contriving such a master-stroke and carrying it outwith that inconceivable boldness.”“But, in that case,” muttered the prefect of police--and, turningto Prasville, he continued--“but, in that case, my dear Prasville,the fellow of whom you spoke to me, the fellow whom you and thechief-detective have had watched since yesterday evening, in hisflat in the Place de Clichy, that fellow is not Arsène Lupin?”“Yes, he is, monsieur le préfet. There is no doubt about thateither.”“Then why wasn’t he arrested when he went out last night?”“He did not go out.”“I say, this is getting complicated!”“It’s quite simple, monsieur le préfet. Like all the houses inwhich traces of Arsène Lupin are to be found, the house in thePlace de Clichy has two outlets.”“And you didn’t know it?”“I didn’t know it. I only discovered it this morning, on inspectingthe flat.”“Was there no one in the flat?”“No. The servant, a man called Achille, went away this morning,taking with him a lady who was staying with Lupin.”“What was the lady’s name?”“I don’t know,” replied Prasville, after an imperceptiblehesitation.“But you know the name under which Arsène Lupin passed?”“Yes. M. Nicole, a private tutor, master of arts and so on. Here ishis card.”As Prasville finished speaking, an office-messenger came to tellthe prefect of police that he was wanted immediately at the Élysée.The prime minister was there already.“I’m coming,” he said. And he added, between his teeth, “It’s todecide upon Gilbert’s fate.”Prasville ventured:“Do you think they will pardon him, monsieur le préfet?”“Never! After last night’s affair, it would make a most deplorableimpression. Gilbert must pay his debt to-morrow morning.”The messenger had, at the same time, handed Prasville avisiting-card. Prasville now looked at it, gave a start andmuttered:“Well, I’m hanged! What a nerve!”“What’s the matter?” asked the prefect of police.“Nothing, nothing, monsieur le préfet,” declared Prasville, who didnot wish to share with another the honour of seeing this businessthrough. “Nothing . . . an unexpected visit.... I hope soon to havethe pleasure of telling you the result.”And he walked away, mumbling, with an air of amazement:“Well, upon my word! What a nerve the beggar has! What a nerve!”The visiting-card which he held in his hand bore these words:          +---------------------------------------------+          |                                             |          |                 _M.

83,15,Chapter 15,"['XIII.THE LAST BATTLEWhen Prasville returned to his office he saw M. Nicole sitting on abench in the waiting-room, with his bent back, his ailing air, hisgingham umbrella, his rusty hat and his single glove:“It’s he all right,” said Prasville, who had feared for a momentthat Lupin might have sent another M. Nicole to see him. “And thefact that he has come in person proves that he does not suspectthat I have seen through him.” And, for the third time, he said,“All the same, what a nerve!”He shut the door of his office and called his secretary:“M. Lartigue, I am having a rather dangerous person shown in here.The chances are that he will have to leave my office with thebracelets on. As soon as he is in my room, make all the necessaryarrangements: send for a dozen inspectors and have them posted inthe waiting-room and in your office. And take this as a definiteinstruction: the moment I ring, you are all to come in, revolversin hand, and surround the fellow. Do you quite understand?”“Yes, monsieur le secrétaire;-général.”“Above all, no hesitation. A sudden entrance, in a body, revolversin hand. Send M. Nicole in, please.”As soon as he was alone, Prasville covered the push of an electricbell on his desk with some papers and placed two revolvers ofrespectable dimensions behind a rampart of books.“And now,” he said to himself, “to sit tight. If he has the list,let’s collar it. If he hasn’t, let’s collar him. And, if possible,let’s collar both. Lupin and the list of the Twenty-seven, on thesame day, especially after the scandal of this morning, would be ascoop in a thousand.”There was a knock at the door.“Come in!” said Prasville.And, rising from his seat:“Come in, M. Nicole, come in.”M. Nicole crept timidly into the room, sat down on the extreme edgeof the chair to which Prasville pointed and said:“I have come . . . to resume . . . our conversation of yesterday....Please excuse the delay, monsieur.”“One second,” said Prasville. “Will you allow me?”He stepped briskly to the outer room and, seeing his secretary:“I was forgetting, M. Lartigue. Have the staircases and passagessearched . . . in case of accomplices.”He returned, settled himself comfortably, as though for a long andinteresting conversation, and began:“You were saying, M. Nicole?”“I was saying, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, that I mustapologize for keeping you waiting yesterday evening. I was detainedby different matters. First of all, Mme. Mergy....”“Yes, you had to see Mme. Mergy home.”“Just so, and to look after her. You can understand the poorthing’s despair.... Her son Gilbert so near death.... And such adeath!... At that time we could only hope for a miracle . . . animpossible miracle. I myself was resigned to the inevitable.... Youknow as well as I do, when fate shows itself implacable, one endsby despairing.”“But I thought,” observed Prasville, “that your intention, onleaving me, was to drag Daubrecq’s secret from him at all costs.”“Certainly. But Daubrecq was not in Paris.”“Oh?”“No. He was on his way to Paris in a motor-car.”“Have you a motor-car, M. Nicole?”“Yes, when I need it: an out-of-date concern, an old tin kettle ofsorts. Well, he was on his way to Paris in a motor-car, or ratheron the roof of a motor-car, inside a trunk in which I packed him.But, unfortunately, the motor was unable to reach Paris until afterthe execution. Thereupon....”Prasville stared at M. Nicole with an air of stupefaction. If hehad retained the least doubt of the individual’s real identity,this manner of dealing with Daubrecq would have removed it. ByJingo! To pack a man in a trunk and pitch him on the top of amotor-car!... No one but Lupin would indulge in such a freak, noone but Lupin would confess it with that ingenuous coolness!“Thereupon,” echoed Prasville, “you decided what?”“I cast about for another method.”“What method?”“Why, surely, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, you know as well asI do!”“How do you mean?”“Why, weren’t you at the execution?”“I was.”“In that case, you saw both Vaucheray and the executioner hit, onemortally, the other with a slight wound. And you can’t fail tosee....”“Oh,” exclaimed Prasville, dumbfounded, “you confess it? It was youwho fired the shots, this morning?”“Come, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, think! What choice had I?The list of the Twenty-seven which you examined was a forgery.Daubrecq, who possessed the genuine one, would not arrive until afew hours after the execution. There was therefore but one way forme to save Gilbert and obtain his pardon; and that was to delay theexecution by a few hours.”“Obviously.”“Well, of course. By killing that infamous brute, that hardenedcriminal, Vaucheray, and wounding the executioner, I spreaddisorder and panic; I made Gilbert’s execution physically andmorally impossible; and I thus gained the few hours which wereindispensable for my purpose.”“Obviously,” repeated Prasville.“Well, of course,” repeated Lupin, “it gives us all--thegovernment, the president and myself--time to reflect and to seethe question in a clearer light. What do you think of it, monsieurle secrétaire;-général?”Prasville thought a number of things, especially that this Nicolewas giving proof, to use a vulgar phrase, of the most infernalcheek, of a cheek so great that Prasville felt inclined to askhimself if he was really right in identifying Nicole with Lupin andLupin with Nicole.“I think, M. Nicole, that a man has to be a jolly good shot to killa person whom he wants to kill, at a distance of a hundred yards,and to wound another person whom he only wants to wound.”“I have had some little practice,” said M. Nicole, with modest air.“And I also think that your plan can only be the fruit of a longpreparation.”“Not at all! That’s where you’re wrong! It was absolutelyspontaneous! If my servant, or rather the servant of the friend wholent me his flat in the Place de Clichy, had not shaken me out ofmy sleep, to tell me that he had once served as a shopman in thatlittle house on the Boulevard Arago, that it did not hold manytenants and that there might be something to be done there, ourpoor Gilbert would have had his head cut off by now . . . and Mme.Mergy would most likely be dead.”“Oh, you think so?”“I am sure of it. And that was why I jumped at that faithfulretainer’s suggestion. Only, you interfered with my plans, monsieurle secrétaire;-général.”“I did?”“Yes. You must needs go and take the three-cornered precaution ofposting twelve men at the door of my house. I had to climb fiveflights of back stairs and go out through the servants’ corridorand the next house. Such useless fatigue!”“I am very sorry, M. Nicole. Another time....”“It was the same thing at eight o’clock this morning, when I waswaiting for the motor which was bringing Daubrecq to me in histrunk: I had to march up and down the Place de Clichy, so as toprevent the car from stopping outside the door of my place and yourmen from interfering in my private affairs. Otherwise, once again,Gilbert and Clarisse Mergy would have been lost.”“But,” said Prasville, “those painful events, it seems to me, areonly delayed for a day, two days, three days at most. To avert themfor good and all we should want....”“The real list, I suppose?”“Exactly. And I daresay you haven’t got it.”“Yes, I have.”“The genuine list?”“The genuine, the undoubtedly genuine list.”“With the cross of Lorraine?”“With the cross of Lorraine.”Prasville was silent. He was labouring under violent emotion,now that the duel was commencing with that adversary of whoseterrifying superiority he was well aware; and he shuddered at theidea that Arsène Lupin, the formidable Arsène Lupin, was there,in front of him, calm and placid, pursuing his aims with as muchcoolness as though he had all the weapons in his hands and wereface to face with a disarmed enemy.Not yet daring to deliver a frontal attack, feeling almostintimidated, Prasville said:“So Daubrecq gave it up to you?”“Daubrecq gives nothing up. I took it.”“By main force, therefore?”“Oh, dear, no!” said M. Nicole, laughing. “Of course, I was readyto go to all lengths; and, when that worthy Daubrecq was dugout of the basket in which he had been travelling express, withan occasional dose of chloroform to keep his strength up, I hadprepared things so that the fun might begin at once. Oh, no uselesstortures . . . no vain sufferings! No.... Death, simply.... Youpress the point of a long needle on the chest, where the heartis, and insert it gradually, softly and gently. That’s all butthe point would have been driven by Mme. Mergy. You understand: amother is pitiless, a mother whose son is about to die!... ‘Speak,Daubrecq, or I’ll go deeper.... You won’t speak?... Then I’llpush another quarter of an inch . . . and another still.’ And thepatient’s heart stops beating, the heart that feels the needlecoming.... And another quarter of an inch . . . and one more.... Iswear before Heaven that the villain would have spoken!... We leantover him and waited for him to wake, trembling with impatience, sourgent was our hurry.... Can’t you picture the scene, monsieur lesecrétaire;-général? The scoundrel lying on a sofa, well bound,bare-chested, making efforts to throw off the fumes of chloroformthat dazed him. He breathes quicker.... He gasps.... He recoversconsciousness . . . his lips move.... Already, Clarisse Mergywhispers, ‘It’s I . . . it’s I, Clarisse.... Will you answer, youwretch?’ She has put her finger on Daubrecq’s chest, at the spotwhere the heart stirs like a little animal hidden under the skin.But she says to me, ‘His eyes . . . his eyes.... I can’t see themunder the spectacles.... I want to see them.... ‘And I also wantto see those eyes which I do not know, I want to see their anguishand I want to read in them, before I hear a word, the secret whichis about to burst from the inmost recesses of the terrified body.I want to see. I long to see. The action which I am about toaccomplish excites me beyond measure. It seems to me that, when Ihave seen the eyes, the veil will be rent asunder. I shall knowthings. It is a presentiment. It is the profound intuition of thetruth that keeps me on tenterhooks. The eye-glasses are gone. Butthe thick opaque spectacles are there still. And I snatch themoff, suddenly. And, suddenly, startled by a disconcerting vision,dazzled by the quick light that breaks in upon me and laughing,oh, but laughing fit to break my jaws, with my thumb--do youunderstand? with my thumb--hop, I force out the left eye!”M. Nicole was really laughing, as he said, fit to break his jaws.And he was no longer the timid little unctuous and obsequiousprovincial usher, but a well-set-up fellow, who, after reciting andmimicking the whole scene with impressive ardour, was now laughingwith a shrill laughter the sound of which made Prasville’s fleshcreep:“Hop! Jump, Marquis! Out of your kennel, Towzer! What’s the use oftwo eyes? It’s one more than you want. Hop! I say, Clarisse, lookat it rolling over the carpet! Mind Daubrecq’s eye! Be careful withthe grate!”M. Nicole, who had risen and pretended to be hunting aftersomething across the room, now sat down again, took from his pocketa thing shaped like a marble, rolled it in the hollow of his hand,chucked it in the air, like a ball, put it back in his fob andsaid, coolly:“Daubrecq’s left eye.”Prasville was utterly bewildered. What was his strange visitordriving at? What did all this story mean? Pale with excitement, hesaid:“Explain yourself.”“But it’s all explained, it seems to me. And it fits in so wellwith things as they were, fits in with all the conjectures whichI had been making in spite of myself and which would inevitablyhave led to my solving the mystery, if that damned Daubrecq hadnot so cleverly sent me astray! Yes, think, follow the trend ofmy suppositions: ‘As the list is not to be discovered away fromDaubrecq,’ I said to myself, ‘it cannot exist away from Daubrecq.And, as it is not to be discovered in the clothes he wears, it mustbe hidden deeper still, in himself, to speak plainly, in his flesh,under his skin....”“In his eye, perhaps?” suggested Prasville, by way of a joke....“In his eye? Monsieur le secrétaire;-général, you have said theword.”“What?”“I repeat, in his eye. And it is a truth that ought to haveoccurred to my mind logically, instead of being revealed to me byaccident. And I will tell you why. Daubrecq knew that Clarissehad seen a letter from him instructing an English manufacturerto ‘empty the crystal within, so as to leave a void which it wasunpossible to suspect.’ Daubrecq was bound, in prudence, to divertany attempt at search. And it was for this reason that he had acrystal stopper made, ‘emptied within,’ after a model supplied byhimself. And it is this crystal stopper which you and I have beenafter for months; and it is this crystal stopper which I dug out ofa packet of tobacco. Whereas all I had to do....”“Was what?” asked Prasville, greatly puzzled.M. Nicole burst into a fresh fit of laughter:“Was simply to go for Daubrecq’s eye, that eye ‘emptied within soas to leave a void which it is impossible to suspect,’ the eyewhich you see before you.”And M. Nicole once more took the thing from his pocket and rappedthe table with it, producing the sound of a hard body with each rap.Prasville whispered, in astonishment:“A glass eye!”“Why, of course!” cried M. Nicole, laughing gaily. “A glass eye!A common or garden decanter-stopper, which the rascal stuckinto his eyesocket in the place of an eye which he had lost--adecanter-stopper, or, if you prefer, a crystal stopper, but thereal one, this time, which he faked, which he hid behind the doublebulwark of his spectacles and eye-glasses, which contained andstill contains the talisman that enabled Daubrecq to work as hepleased in safety.”Prasville lowered his head and put his hand to his forehead tohide his flushed face: he was almost possessing the list of theTwenty-seven. It lay before him, on the table.Mastering his emotion, he said, in a casual tone:“So it is there still?”“At least, I suppose so,” declared M. Nicole.“What! You suppose so?”“I have not opened the hiding-place. I thought, monsieur lesecrétaire;-général, I would reserve that honour for you.”Prasville put out his hand, took the thing up and inspected it. Itwas a block of crystal, imitating nature to perfection, with allthe details of the eyeball, the iris, the pupil, the cornea.He at once saw a movable part at the back, which slid in a groove.He pushed it. The eye was hollow.There was a tiny ball of paper inside. He unfolded it, smoothedit out and, quickly, without delaying to make a preliminaryexamination of the names, the hand-writing or the signatures, heraised his arms and turned the paper to the light from the windows.“Is the cross of Lorraine there?” asked M. Nicole.“Yes, it is there,” replied Prasville. “This is the genuine list.”He hesitated a few seconds and remained with his arms raised, whilereflecting what he would do. Then he folded up the paper again,replaced it in its little crystal sheath and put the whole thing inhis pocket. M. Nicole, who was looking at him, asked:“Are you convinced?”“Absolutely.”“Then we are agreed?”“We are agreed.”There was a pause, during which the two men watched each otherwithout appearing to. M. Nicole seemed to be waiting for theconversation to be resumed. Prasville, sheltered behind the pilesof books on the table, sat with one hand grasping his revolver andthe other touching the push of the electric bell. He felt the wholestrength of his position with a keen zest. He held the list. Heheld Lupin:“If he moves,” he thought, “I cover him with my revolver and Iring. If he attacks me, I shoot.”And the situation appeared to him so pleasant that he prolonged it,with the exquisite relish of an epicure.In the end, M. Nicole took up the threads:“As we are agreed, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, I think thereis nothing left for you to do but to hurry. Is the execution totake place to-morrow?”“Yes, to-morrow.”“In that case, I shall wait here.”“Wait for what?”“The answer from the Élysée.”“Oh, is some one to bring you an answer?”“Yes.”“You, monsieur le secrétaire;-général.”Prasville shook his head:“You must not count on me, M. Nicole.”“Really?” said M. Nicole, with an air of surprise. “May I ask thereason?”“I have changed my mind.”“Is that all?”“That’s all. I have come to the conclusion that, as things stand,after this last scandal, it is impossible to try to do anythingin Gilbert’s favour. Besides, an attempt in this direction at theÉlysée, under present conditions, would constitute a regular caseof blackmail, to which I absolutely decline to lend myself.”“You are free to do as you please, monsieur. Your scruples do youhonour, though they come rather late, for they did not trouble youyesterday. But, in that case, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, asthe compact between us is destroyed, give me back the list of theTwenty-seven.”“What for?”“So that I may apply to another spokesman.”“What’s the good? Gilbert is lost.”“Not at all, not at all. On the contrary, I consider that, nowthat his accomplice is dead, it will be much easier to grant him apardon which everybody will look upon as fair and humane. Give meback the list.”“Upon my word, monsieur, you have a short memory and none too nicea conscience. Have you forgotten your promise of yesterday?”“Yesterday, I made a promise to a M. Nicole.”“Well?”“You are not M. Nicole.”“Indeed! Then, pray, who am I?”“Need I tell you?”M. Nicole made no reply, but began to laugh softly, as thoughpleased at the curious turn which the conversation was taking;and Prasville felt a vague misgiving at observing that fit ofmerriment. He grasped the butt-end of his revolver and wonderedwhether he ought not to ring for help.M. Nicole drew his chair close to the desk, put his two elbows onthe table, looked Prasville straight in the face and jeered:“So, M. Prasville, you know who I am and you have the assurance toplay this game with me?”“I have that assurance,” said Prasville, accepting the sneerwithout flinching.“Which proves that you consider me, Arsène Lupin--we may as welluse the name: yes, Arsène Lupin--which proves that you consider mefool enough, dolt enough to deliver myself like this, bound handand foot into your hands.”“Upon my word,” said Prasville, airily, patting thewaistcoat-pocket in which he had secreted the crystal ball, “Idon’t quite see what you can do, M. Nicole, now that Daubrecq’s eyeis here, with the list of the Twenty-seven inside it.”“What I can do?” echoed M. Nicole, ironically.“Yes! The talisman no longer protects you; and you are now nobetter off than any other man who might venture into the very heartof the police-office, among some dozens of stalwart fellows postedbehind each of those doors and some hundreds of others who willhasten up at the first signal.”M. Nicole shrugged his shoulders and gave Prasville a look of greatcommiseration:“Shall I tell you what is happening, monsieur lesecrétaire;-général? Well, you too are having your head turnedby all this business. Now that you possess the list, your stateof mind has suddenly sunk to that of a Daubrecq or a d’Albufex.There is no longer even a question, in your thoughts, of taking itto your superiors, so that this ferment of disgrace and discordmay be ended. No, no; a sodden temptation has seized upon you andintoxicated you; and, losing your head, you say to yourself, ‘Itis here, in my pocket. With its aid, I am omnipotent. It meanswealth, absolute, unbounded power. Why not benefit by it? Why notlet Gilbert and Clarisse Mergy die? Why not lock up that idiot ofa Lupin? Why not seize this unparalleled piece of fortune by theforelock?’”He bent toward Prasville and, very softly, in a friendly andconfidential tone, said:“Don’t do that, my dear sir, don’t do it.”“And why not?”“It is not to your interest, believe me.”“Really!”“No. Or, if you absolutely insist on doing it, have the kindnessfirst to consult the twenty-seven names on the list of which youhave just robbed me and reflect, for a moment, on the name of thethird person on it.”“Oh? And what is the name of that third person?”“It is the name of a friend of yours.”“What friend?”“Stanislas Vorenglade, the ex-deputy.”“And then?” said Prasville, who seemed to be losing some of hisself-confidence.“Then? Ask yourself if an inquiry, however summary, would not endby discovering, behind that Stanislas Vorenglade, the name of onewho shared certain little profits with him.”“And whose name is?”“Louis Prasville.”M. Nicole banged the table with his fist.“Enough of this humbug, monsieur! For twenty minutes, you and Ihave been beating about the bush. That will do. Let us understandeach other. And, to begin with, drop your pistols. You can’timagine that I am frightened of those playthings! Stand up, sir,stand up, as I am doing, and finish the business: I am in a hurry.”He put his hand on Prasville’s shoulder and, speaking with greatdeliberation, said:“If, within an hour from now, you are not back from the Élysée,bringing with you a line to say that the decree of pardon has beensigned; if, within one hour and ten minutes, I, Arsène Lupin, donot walk out of this building safe and sound and absolutely free,this evening four Paris newspapers will receive four lettersselected from the correspondence exchanged between StanislasVorenglade and yourself, the correspondence which StanislasVorenglade sold me this morning. Here’s your hat, here’s yourovercoat, here’s your stick. Be off. I will wait for you.”Then happened this extraordinary and yet easily understood thing,that Prasville did not raise the slightest protest nor make theleast show of fight. He received the sudden, far-reaching, utterconviction of what the personality known as Arsène Lupin meant,in all its breadth and fulness. He did not so much as think ofcarping, of pretending--as he had until then believed--that theletters had been destroyed by Vorenglade the deputy or, at anyrate, that Vorenglade would not dare to hand them over, because,in so doing, Vorenglade was also working his own destruction. No,Prasville did not speak a word. He felt himself caught in a viseof which no human strength could force the jaws asunder. There wasnothing to do but yield. He yielded.“Here, in an hour,” repeated M. Nicole.“In an hour,” said Prasville, tamely. Nevertheless, in order toknow exactly where he stood, he added, “The letters, of course,will be restored to me against Gilbert’s pardon?”“No.”“How do you mean, no? In that case, there is no object in....”“They will be restored to you, intact, two months after the daywhen my friends and I have brought about Gilbert’s escape . . .thanks to the very slack watch which will be kept upon him, inaccordance with your orders.”“Is that all?”“No, there are two further conditions: first, the immediate paymentof a cheque for forty thousand francs.”“Forty thousand francs?”“The sum for which Stanislas Vorenglade sold me the letters. It isonly fair....”“And next?”“Secondly, your resignation, within six months, of your presentposition.”“My resignation? But why?”M. Nicole made a very dignified gesture:“Because it is against public morals that one of the highestpositions in the police-service should be occupied by a man whosehands are not absolutely clean. Make them send you to parliament orappoint you a minister, a councillor of State, an ambassador, inshort, any post which your success in the Daubrecq case entitlesyou to demand. But not secretary-general of police; anything butthat! The very thought of it disgusts me.”Prasville reflected for a moment. He would have rejoiced in thesudden destruction of his adversary and he racked his brain for themeans to effect it. But he was helpless.He went to the door and called:“M. Lartigue.” And, sinking his voice, but not very low, for hewished M. Nicole to hear, “M. Lartigue, dismiss your men. It’s amistake. And let no one come into my office while I am gone. Thisgentleman will wait for me here.”He came back, took the hat, stick and overcoat which M. Nicolehanded him and went out.“Well done, sir,” said Lupin, between his teeth, when the door wasclosed. “You have behaved like a sportsman and a gentleman.... Sodid I, for that matter . . . perhaps with too obvious a touch ofcontempt . . . and a little too bluntly. But, tush, this sort ofbusiness has to be carried through with a high hand! The enemy’sgot to be staggered! Besides, when one’s own conscience is clear,one can’t take up too bullying a tone with that sort of individual.Lift your head, Lupin. You have been the champion of outragedmorality. Be proud of your work. And now take a chair, stretch outyour legs and have a rest. You’ve deserved it.”When Prasville returned, he found Lupin sound asleep and had to taphim on the shoulder to wake him.“Is it done?” asked Lupin.“It’s done. The pardon will be signed presently. Here is thewritten promise.”“The forty thousand francs?”“Here’s your cheque.”“Good. It but remains for me to thank you, monsieur.”“So the correspondence....”“The Stanislas Vorenglade correspondence will be handed to you onthe conditions stated. However, I am glad to be able to give you,here and now, as a sign of my gratitude, the four letters which Imeant to send to the papers this evening.”“Oh, so you had them on you?” said Prasville.“I felt so certain, monsieur le secrétaire;-général, that we shouldend by coming to an understanding.”He took from his hat a fat envelope, sealed with five red seals,which was pinned inside the lining, and handed it to Prasville, whothrust it into his pocket. Then he said:“Monsieur le secrétaire;-général, I don’t know when I shallhave the pleasure of seeing you again. If you have the leastcommunication to make to me, one line in the agony column of the_Journal_ will be sufficient. Just head it, ‘M. Nicole.’ Good-dayto you.”And he withdrew.Prasville, when he was alone, felt as if he were waking from anightmare during which he had performed incoherent actions overwhich his conscious mind had no control. He was almost thinkingof ringing and causing a stir in the passages; but, just then,there was a tap at the door and one of the office-messengers camehurrying in.“What’s the matter?” asked Prasville.“Monsieur le secrétaire;-général, it’s Monsieur le Député Daubrecqasking to see you . . . on a matter of the highest importance.”“Daubrecq!” exclaimed Prasville, in bewilderment. “Daubrecq here!Show him in.”[Illustration: Daubrecq ran up to Prasville out of breath and caughthold of him with his two enormous hands.]Daubrecq had not waited for the order. He ran up to Prasville, outof breath, with his clothes in disorder, a bandage over his lefteye, no tie, no collar, looking like an escaped lunatic; and thedoor was not closed before he caught hold of Prasville with his twoenormous hands:“Have you the list?”“Yes.”“Have you bought it?”“Yes.”“At the price of Gilbert’s pardon?”“Yes.”“Is it signed?”“Yes.”Daubrecq made a furious gesture:“You fool! You fool! You’ve been trapped! For hatred of me, Iexpect? And now you’re going to take your revenge?”“With a certain satisfaction, Daubrecq. Remember my little friend,the opera-dancer, at Nice.... It’s your turn now to dance.”“So it means prison?”“I should think so,” said Prasville. “Besides, it doesn’t matter.You’re done for, anyhow. Deprived of the list, without defence ofany kind, you’re bound to fall to pieces of your own weight. And Ishall be present at the break-up. That’s my revenge.”“And you believe that!” yelled Daubrecq, furiously. “You believethat they will wring my neck like a chicken’s and that I shall notknow how to defend myself and that I have no claws left and noteeth to bite with! Well, my boy, if I do come to grief, there’salways one who will fall with me and that is Master Prasville, thepartner of Stanislas Vorenglade, who is going to hand me everyproof in existence against him, so that I may get him sent togaol without delay. Aha, I’ve got you fixed, old chap! With thoseletters, you’ll go as I please, hang it all, and there will be finedays yet for Daubrecq the deputy! What! You’re laughing, are you?Perhaps those letters don’t exist?”Prasville shrugged his shoulders:“Yes, they exist. But Vorenglade no longer has them in hispossession.”“Since when?”“Since this morning. Vorenglade sold them, two hours ago, for thesum of forty thousand francs; and I have bought them back at thesame price.”Daubrecq burst into a great roar of laughter:“Lord, how funny! Forty thousand francs! You’ve paid forty thousandfrancs! To M. Nicole, I suppose, who sold you the list of theTwenty-seven? Well, would you like me to tell you the real name ofM. Nicole? It’s Arsène Lupin!”“I know that.”“Very likely. But what you don’t know, you silly ass, is that Ihave come straight from Stanislas Vorenglade’s and that StanislasVorenglade left Paris four days ago! Oh, what a joke! They’ve soldyou waste paper! And your forty thousand francs! What an ass! Whatan ass!”He walked out of the room, screaming with laughter and leavingPrasville absolutely dumbfounded.So Arsène Lupin possessed no proof at all; and, when he wasthreatening and commanding and treating Prasville with that airyinsolence, it was all a farce, all bluff!“No, no, it’s impossible,” thought the secretary-general. “I havethe sealed envelope.... It’s here.... I have only to open it.”He dared not open it. He handled it, weighed it, examined it....And doubt made its way so swiftly into his mind that he was not inthe least surprised, when he did open it, to find that it containedfour blank sheets of note-paper.“Well, well,” he said, “I am no match for those rascals. But all isnot over yet.”And, in point of fact, all was not over. If Lupin had acted sodaringly, it showed that the letters existed and that he reliedupon buying them from Stanislas Vorenglade. But, as, on the otherhand, Vorenglade was not in Paris, Prasville’s business was simplyto forestall Lupin’s steps with regard to Vorenglade and obtainthe restitution of those dangerous letters from Vorenglade at allcosts. The first to arrive would be the victor.Prasville once more took his hat, coat and stick, went downstairs,stepped into a taxi and drove to Vorenglade’s flat.Here he was told that the ex-deputy was expected home from Londonat six o’clock that evening.It was two o’clock in the afternoon. Prasville therefore had plentyof time to prepare his plan.He arrived at the Gare du Nord at five o’clock and posted allaround, in the waiting-rooms and in the railway-offices, the threeor four dozen detectives whom he had brought with him.This made him feel easy. If M. Nicole tried to speak to Vorenglade,they would arrest Lupin. And, to make assurance doubly sure, theywould arrest whosoever could be suspected of being either Lupin orone of Lupin’s emissaries.Moreover, Prasville made a close inspection of the whole station.He discovered nothing suspicious. But, at ten minutes to six,Chief-inspector Blanchon, who was with him, said:“Look, there’s Daubrecq.”Daubrecq it was; and the sight of his enemy exasperated thesecretary-general to such a pitch that he was on the verge ofhaving him arrested. But he reflected that he had no excuse, noright, no warrant for the arrest.Besides, Daubrecq’s presence proved, with still greater force,that everything now depended on Stanislas Vorenglade. Vorengladepossessed the letters: who would end by having them? Daubrecq?Lupin? Or he, Prasville?Lupin was not there and could not be there. Daubrecq was not in aposition to fight. There could be no doubt, therefore, about theresult: Prasville would reenter into possession of his letters and,through this very fact, would escape Daubrecq’s threats and Lupin’sthreats and recover all his freedom of action against them.The train arrived.In accordance with orders, the stationmaster had issuedinstructions that no one was to be admitted to the platform.Prasville, therefore, walked on alone, in front of a number of hismen, with Chief-inspector Blanchon at their head.The train drew up.Prasville almost at once saw Stanislas Vorenglade at the window ofa first-class compartment, in the middle of the train.The ex-deputy alighted and then held out his hand to assist an oldgentleman who was travelling with him.Prasville ran up to him and said, eagerly:“Vorenglade . . . I want to speak to you....”At the same moment, Daubrecq, who had managed to pass the barrier,appeared and exclaimed:“M. Vorenglade, I have had your letter. I am at your disposal.”Vorenglade looked at the two men, recognized Prasville, recognizedDaubrecq, and smiled:“Oho, it seems that my return was awaited with some impatience!What’s it all about? Certain letters, I expect?”“Yes . . . yes . . .” replied the two men, fussing around him.“You’re too late,” he declared.“Eh? What? What do you mean?”“I mean that the letters are sold.”“Sold! To whom?”“To this gentleman,” said Vorenglade, pointing to histravelling-companion, “to this gentleman, who thought that thebusiness was worth going out of his way for and who came to Amiensto meet me.”The old gentleman, a very old man wrapped in furs and leaning onhis stick, took off his hat and bowed.“It’s Lupin,” thought Prasville, “it’s Lupin, beyond a doubt.”And he glanced toward the detectives, was nearly calling them, butthe old gentleman explained:“Yes, I thought the letters were good enough to warrant a fewhours’ railway journey and the cost of two return tickets.”“Two tickets?”“One for me and the other for one of my friends.”“One of your friends?”“Yes, he left us a few minutes ago and reached the front part ofthe train through the corridor. He was in a great hurry.”Prasville understood: Lupin had taken the precaution to bring anaccomplice, and the accomplice was carrying off the letters. Thegame was lost, to a certainty. Lupin had a firm grip on his victim.There was nothing to do but submit and accept the conqueror’sconditions.“Very well, sir,” said Prasville. “We shall see each other when thetime comes. Good-bye for the present, Daubrecq: you shall hear fromme.” And, drawing Vorenglade aside, “As for you, Vorenglade, youare playing a dangerous game.”“Dear me!” said the ex-deputy. “And why?”The two men moved away.Daubrecq had not uttered a word and stood motionless, as thoughrooted to the ground.The old gentleman went up to him and whispered:“I say, Daubrecq, wake up, old chap.... It’s the chloroform, Iexpect....”Daubrecq clenched his fists and gave a muttered growl.“Ah, I see you know me!” said the old gentleman. “Then you willremember our interview, some months ago, when I came to see youin the Square Lamartine and asked you to intercede in Gilbert’sfavour. I said to you that day, ‘Lay down your arms, save Gilbertand I will leave you in peace. If not, I shall take the list of theTwenty-seven from you; and then you’re done for.’ Well, I have astrong suspicion that done for is what you are. That comes of notmaking terms with kind M. Lupin. Sooner or later, you’re bound tolose your boots by it. However, let it be a lesson to you.... Bythe way, here’s your pocketbook which I forgot to give you. Excuseme if you find it lightened of its contents. There were not only adecent number of bank-notes in it, but also the receipt from thewarehouse where you stored the Enghien things which you took backfrom me. I thought I might as well save you the trouble of takingthem out yourself. It ought to be done by now. No, don’t thank me:it’s not worth mentioning. Good-bye, Daubrecq. And, if you shouldwant a louis or two, to buy yourself a new decanter-stopper, dropme a line. Good-bye, Daubrecq.”He walked away.He had not gone fifty steps when he heard the sound of a shot.He turned round.Daubrecq had blown his brains out.“_De profundis!_” murmured Lupin, taking off his hat.       *       *       *       *       *Two months later, Gilbert, whose sentence had been commuted to oneof penal servitude for life, made his escape from the Île de Ré, onthe day before that on which he was to have been transported to NewCaledonia.It was a strange escape. Its least details remained difficult tounderstand; and, like the two shots on the Boulevard Arago, itgreatly enhanced Arsène Lupin’s prestige.“Taken all round,” said Lupin to me, one day, after telling me thedifferent episodes of the story, “taken all around, no enterprisehas ever given me more trouble or cost me greater exertions thanthat confounded adventure which, if you don’t mind, we will call,_The Crystal Stopper; or, Never Say Die_. In twelve hours, betweensix o’clock in the morning and six o’clock in the evening, I madeup for six months of bad luck, blunders, gropings in the dark andreverses. I certainly count those twelve hours among the finest andthe most glorious of my life.”“And Gilbert?” I asked. “What became of him?”“He is farming his own land, way down in Algeria, under hisreal name, his only name of Antoine Mergy. He is married to anEnglishwoman, and they have a son whom he insisted on callingArsène. I often receive a bright, chatty, warm-hearted letter fromhim.”“And Mme. Mergy?”“She and her little Jacques are living with them.”“Did you see her again?”“I did not.”“Really!”Lupin hesitated for a few moments and then said with a smile:“My dear fellow, I will let you into a secret that will make meseem ridiculous in your eyes. But you know that I have alwaysbeen as sentimental as a schoolboy and as silly as a goose. Well,on the evening when I went back to Clarisse Mergy and told herthe news of the day--part of which, for that matter, she alreadyknew--I felt two things very thoroughly. One was that I entertainedfor her a much deeper feeling than I thought; the other thatshe, on the contrary, entertained for me a feeling which was notwithout contempt, not without a rankling grudge nor even a certainaversion.”“Nonsense! Why?”“Why? Because Clarisse Mergy is an exceedingly honest woman andbecause I am . . . just Arsène Lupin.”“Oh!”“Dear me, yes, an attractive bandit, a romantic and chivalrouscracksman, anything you please. For all that, in the eyes of areally honest woman, with an upright nature and a well-balancedmind, I am only the merest riff-raff.”I saw that the wound was sharper than he was willing to admit, andI said:“So you really loved her?”“I even believe,” he said, in a jesting tone, “that I asked her tomarry me. After all, I had saved her son, had I not?... So . . . Ithought. What a rebuff!... It produced a coolness between us....Since then....”“You have forgotten her?”“Oh, certainly! But it required the consolations of one Italian,two Americans, three Russians, a German grand-duchess and aChinawoman to do it!”“And, after that....?”“After that, so as to place an insuperable barrier between myselfand her, I got married.”“Nonsense! You got married, you, Arsène Lupin?”“Married, wedded, spliced, in the most lawful fashion. One of thegreatest names in France. An only daughter. A colossal fortune....What! You don’t know the story? Well, it’s worth hearing.”And, straightway, Lupin, who was in a confidential vein, began totell me the story of his marriage to Angélique de Sarzeau-Vendôme,Princesse de Bourbon-Condé, to-day Sister Marie-Auguste, a humblenun in the Visitation Convent....[G]But, after the first few words, he stopped, as though his narrativehad suddenly ceased to interest him, and he remained pensive.“What’s the matter, Lupin?”“The matter? Nothing.”“Yes, yes.... There . . . now you’re smiling.... Is it Daubrecq’ssecret receptacle, his glass eye, that’s making you laugh?”“Not at all.”“What then?”“Nothing, I tell you . . . only a memory.”“A pleasant memory?”“Yes!... Yes, a delightful memory even. It was at night, off theÎle de Ré, on the fishing-smack in which Clarisse and I were takingGilbert away.... We were alone, the two of us, in the stern of theboat.... And I remember.... I talked.... I spoke words and morewords.... I said all that I had on my heart.... And then . . . thencame silence, a perturbing and disarming silence.”“Well?”“Well, I swear to you that the woman whom I took in my arms thatnight and kissed on the lips--oh, not for long: a few seconds only,but no matter!--I swear before heaven that she was something morethan a grateful mother, something more than a friend yielding toa moment of susceptibility, that she was a woman also, a womanquivering with emotion....” And he continued, with a bitter laugh,“Who ran away next day, never to see me again.”He was silent once more. Then he whispered:“Clarisse.... Clarisse.... On the day when I am tired anddisappointed and weary of life, I will come to you down there, inyour little Arab house  . . . in that little white house, Clarisse,where you are waiting for me....”[G] See _The Confessions of Arsène Lupin_.

84,1,Chapter 1,"['Produced by John T. Horner and David WidgerTHE LAST DAYS OF POMPEIIby Edward George Bulwer-LyttonBOOK THE FIRSTChapter I.THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF POMPEII.\'HO, Diomed, well met!  Do you sup with Glaucus to-night?\' said a youngman of small stature, who wore his tunic in those loose and effeminatefolds which proved him to be a gentleman and a coxcomb.\'Alas, no! dear Clodius; he has not invited me,\' replied Diomed, a manof portly frame and of middle age.  \'By Pollux, a scurvy trick! for theysay his suppers are the best in Pompeii\'.\'Pretty well--though there is never enough of wine for me.  It is notthe old Greek blood that flows in his veins, for he pretends that winemakes him dull the next morning.\'\'There may be another reason for that thrift,\' said Diomed, raising hisbrows.  \'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, Ifancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphoraebetter than his wit.\'\'An additional reason for supping with him while the sesterces last.Next year, Diomed, we must find another Glaucus.\'\'He is fond of the dice, too, I hear.\'\'He is fond of every pleasure; and while he likes the pleasure of givingsuppers, we are all fond of him.\'\'Ha, ha, Clodius, that is well said!  Have you ever seen my wine-cellars,by-the-by?\'\'I think not, my good Diomed.\'\'Well, you must sup with me some evening; I have tolerable muraenae inmy reservoir, and I ask Pansa the aedile to meet you.\'\'O, no state with me!--Persicos odi apparatus, I am easily contented.Well, the day wanes; I am for the baths--and you...\'\'To the quaestor--business of state--afterwards to the temple of Isis.Vale!\'\'An ostentatious, bustling, ill-bred fellow,\' muttered Clodius tohimself, as he sauntered slowly away.  \'He thinks with his feasts andhis wine-cellars to make us forget that he is the son of a freedman--andso we will, when we do him the honour of winning his money; these richplebeians are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles.\'Thus soliloquising, Clodius arrived in the Via Domitiana, which wascrowded with passengers and chariots, and exhibited all that gay andanimated exuberance of life and motion which we find at this day in thestreets of Naples.The bells of the cars as they rapidly glided by each other jingledmerrily on the ear, and Clodius with smiles or nods claimed familiaracquaintance with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic: infact, no idler was better known in Pompeii.\'What, Clodius! and how have you slept on your good fortune?\' cried, ina pleasant and musical voice, a young man, in a chariot of the mostfastidious and graceful fashion.  Upon its surface of bronze wereelaborately wrought, in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece,reliefs of the Olympian games; the two horses that drew the car were ofthe rarest breed of Parthia; their slender limbs seemed to disdain theground and court the air, and yet at the slightest touch of thecharioteer, who stood behind the young owner of the equipage, theypaused motionless, as if suddenly transformed into stone--lifeless, butlifelike, as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles. The ownerhimself was of that slender and beautiful symmetry from which thesculptors of Athens drew their models; his Grecian origin betrayeditself in his light but clustering locks, and the perfect harmony of hisfeatures.  He wore no toga, which in the time of the emperors had indeedceased to be the general distinction of the Romans, and was especiallyridiculed by the pretenders to fashion; but his tunic glowed in therichest hues of the Tyrian dye, and the fibulae, or buckles, by which itwas fastened, sparkled with emeralds: around his neck was a chain ofgold, which in the middle of his breast twisted itself into the form ofa serpent\'s head, from the mouth of which hung pendent a large signetring of elaborate and most exquisite workmanship; the sleeves of thetunic were loose, and fringed at the hand with gold: and across thewaist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs, and of the same material asthe fringe, served in lieu of pockets for the receptacle of thehandkerchief and the purse, the stilus and the tablets.\'My dear Glaucus!\' said Clodius, \'I rejoice to see that your losses haveso little affected your mien.  Why, you seem as if you had been inspiredby Apollo, and your face shines with happiness like a glory; any onemight take you for the winner, and me for the loser.\'\'And what is there in the loss or gain of those dull pieces of metalthat should change our spirit, my Clodius?  By Venus, while yet young,we can cover our full locks with chaplets--while yet the cithara soundson unsated ears--while yet the smile of Lydia or of Chloe flashes overour veins in which the blood runs so swiftly, so long shall we finddelight in the sunny air, and make bald time itself but the treasurer ofour joys.  You sup with me to-night, you know.\'\'Who ever forgets the invitation of Glaucus!\'\'But which way go you now?\'\'Why, I thought of visiting the baths: but it wants yet an hour to theusual time.\'\'Well, I will dismiss my chariot, and go with you.  So, so, my Phylias,\'stroking the horse nearest to him, which by a low neigh and withbackward ears playfully acknowledged the courtesy: \'a holiday for youto-day.  Is he not handsome, Clodius?\'\'Worthy of Phoebus,\' returned the noble parasite--\'or of Glaucus.\'Chapter IITHE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL, AND THE BEAUTY OF FASHION.  THE ATHENIAN\'SCONFESSION.  THE READER\'S INTRODUCTION TO ARBACES OF EGYPT.TALKING lightly on a thousand matters, the two young men saunteredthrough the streets; they were now in that quarter which was filled withthe gayest shops, their open interiors all and each radiant with thegaudy yet harmonious colors of frescoes, inconceivably varied in fancyand design. The sparkling fountains, that at every vista threw upwardstheir grateful spray in the summer air; the crowd of passengers, orrather loiterers, mostly clad in robes of the Tyrian dye; the gay groupscollected round each more attractive shop; the slaves passing to and frowith buckets of bronze, cast in the most graceful shapes, and borne upontheir heads; the country girls stationed at frequent intervals withbaskets of blushing fruit, and flowers more alluring to the ancientItalians than to their descendants (with whom, indeed, ""latet anguis inherba,"" a disease seems lurking in every violet and rose); the numeroushaunts which fulfilled with that idle people the office of cafes andclubs at this day; the shops, where on shelves of marble were ranged thevases of wine and oil, and before whose thresholds, seats, protectedfrom the sun by a purple awning, invited the weary to rest and theindolent to lounge--made a scene of such glowing and vivaciousexcitement, as might well give the Athenian spirit of Glaucus an excusefor its susceptibility to joy.\'Talk to me no more of Rome,\' said he to Clodius.  \'Pleasure is toostately and ponderous in those mighty walls: even in the precincts ofthe court--even in the Golden House of Nero, and the incipient gloriesof the palace of Titus, there is a certain dulness of magnificence--theeye aches--the spirit is wearied; besides, my Clodius, we arediscontented when we compare the enormous luxury and wealth of otherswith the mediocrity of our own state.  But here we surrender ourselveseasily to pleasure, and we have the brilliancy of luxury without thelassitude of its pomp.\'\'It was from that feeling that you chose your summer retreat atPompeii?\'\'It was.  I prefer it to Baiae: I grant the charms of the latter, but Ilove not the pedants who resort there, and who seem to weigh out theirpleasures by the drachm.\'\'Yet you are fond of the learned, too; and as for poetry, why, yourhouse is literally eloquent with AEschylus and Homer, the epic and thedrama.\'\'Yes, but those Romans who mimic my Athenian ancestors do everything soheavily.  Even in the chase they make their slaves carry Plato withthem; and whenever the boar is lost, out they take their books and theirpapyrus, in order not to lose their time too. When the dancing-girlsswim before them in all the blandishment of Persian manners, some droneof a freedman, with a face of stone, reads them a section of Cicero ""DeOfficiis"".  Unskilful pharmacists! pleasure and study are not elementsto be thus mixed together, they must be enjoyed separately: the Romanslose both by this pragmatical affectation of refinement, and prove thatthey have no souls for either. Oh, my Clodius, how little yourcountrymen know of the true versatility of a Pericles, of the truewitcheries of an Aspasia!  It was but the other day that I paid a visitto Pliny: he was sitting in his summer-house writing, while anunfortunate slave played on the tibia.  His nephew (oh! whip me suchphilosophical coxcombs!) was reading Thucydides\' description of theplague, and nodding his conceited little head in time to the music,while his lips were repeating all the loathsome details of that terribledelineation. The puppy saw nothing incongruous in learning at the sametime a ditty of love and a description of the plague.\'\'Why, they are much the same thing,\' said Clodius.\'So I told him, in excuse for his coxcombry--but my youth stared merebukingly in the face, without taking the jest, and answered, that itwas only the insensate ear that the music pleased, whereas the book (thedescription of the plague, mind you!) elevated the heart.  ""Ah!"" quoththe fat uncle, wheezing, ""my boy is quite an Athenian, always mixing theutile with the dulce."" O Minerva, how I laughed in my sleeve!  While Iwas there, they came to tell the boy-sophist that his favorite freedmanwas just dead of a fever.  ""Inexorable death!"" cried he; ""get me myHorace.  How beautifully the sweet poet consoles us for thesemisfortunes!""  Oh, can these men love, my Clodius?  Scarcely even withthe senses.  How rarely a Roman has a heart!  He is but the mechanism ofgenius--he wants its bones and flesh.\'Though Clodius was secretly a little sore at these remarks on hiscountrymen, he affected to sympathize with his friend, partly because hewas by nature a parasite, and partly because it was the fashion amongthe dissolute young Romans to affect a little contempt for the verybirth which, in reality, made them so arrogant; it was the mode toimitate the Greeks, and yet to laugh at their own clumsy imitation.Thus conversing, their steps were arrested by a crowd gathered round anopen space where three streets met; and, just where the porticoes of alight and graceful temple threw their shade, there stood a young girl,with a flower-basket on her right arm, and a small three-stringedinstrument of music in the left hand, to whose low and soft tones shewas modulating a wild and half-barbaric air.  At every pause in themusic she gracefully waved her flower-basket round, inviting theloiterers to buy; and many a sesterce was showered into the basket,either in compliment to the music or in compassion to thesongstress--for she was blind.\'It is my poor Thessalian,\' said Glaucus, stopping; \'I have not seen hersince my return to Pompeii.  Hush! her voice is sweet; let us listen.\'          THE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL\'S SONG                    I.         Buy my flowers--O buy--I pray!           The blind girl comes from afar;         If the earth be as fair as I hear them say,           These flowers her children are!         Do they her beauty keep?           They are fresh from her lap, I know;         For I caught them fast asleep           In her arms an hour ago.           With the air which is her breath--          Her soft and delicate breath--          Over them murmuring low!        On their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet,        And their cheeks with her tender tears are wet.        For she weeps--that gentle mother weeps--       (As morn and night her watch she keeps,        With a yearning heart and a passionate care)        To see the young things grow so fair;           She weeps--for love she weeps;           And the dews are the tears she weeps           From the well of a mother\'s love!                    II.         Ye have a world of light,           Where love in the loved rejoices;         But the blind girl\'s home is the House of Night,           And its beings are empty voices.           As one in the realm below,           I stand by the streams of woe!           I hear the vain shadows glide,           I feel their soft breath at my side.             And I thirst the loved forms to see,           And I stretch my fond arms around,           And I catch but a shapeless sound,           For the living are ghosts to me.            Come buy--come buy?--          (Hark! how the sweet things sigh           For they have a voice like ours),           `The breath of the blind girl closes           The leaves of the saddening roses--          We are tender, we sons of light,           We shrink from this child of night;           From the grasp of the blind girl free us--          We yearn for the eyes that see us--         We are for night too gay,           In your eyes we behold the day--             O buy--O buy the flowers!\'\'I must have yon bunch of violets, sweet Nydia,\' said Glaucus, pressingthrough the crowd, and dropping a handful of small coins into thebasket; \'your voice is more charming than ever.\'The blind girl started forward as she heard the Athenian\'s voice; thenas suddenly paused, while the blood rushed violently over neck, cheek,and temples.\'So you are returned!\' said she, in a low voice; and then repeated halfto herself, \'Glaucus is returned!\'\'Yes, child, I have not been at Pompeii above a few days.  My gardenwants your care, as before; you will visit it, I trust, to-morrow.  Andmind, no garlands at my house shall be woven by any hands but those ofthe pretty Nydia.\'Nydia smiled joyously, but did not answer; and Glaucus, placing in hisbreast the violets he had selected, turned gaily and carelessly from thecrowd.\'So she is a sort of client of yours, this child?\' said Clodius.\'Ay--does she not sing prettily?  She interests me, the poor slave!Besides, she is from the land of the Gods\' hill--Olympus frowned uponher cradle--she is of Thessaly.\'\'The witches\' country.\'\'True: but for my part I find every woman a witch; and at Pompeii, byVenus! the very air seems to have taken a love-philtre, so handsome doesevery face without a beard seem in my eyes.\'\'And lo! one of the handsomest in Pompeii, old Diomed\'s daughter, therich Julia!\' said Clodius, as a young lady, her face covered by herveil, and attended by two female slaves, approached them, in her way tothe baths.\'Fair Julia, we salute thee!\' said Clodius.Julia partly raised her veil, so as with some coquetry to display a boldRoman profile, a full dark bright eye, and a cheek over whose naturalolive art shed a fairer and softer rose.\'And Glaucus, too, is returned!\' said she, glancing meaningly at theAthenian.  \'Has he forgotten,\' she added, in a half-whisper, \'hisfriends of the last year?\'\'Beautiful Julia! even Lethe itself, if it disappear in one part of theearth, rises again in another.  Jupiter does not allow us ever to forgetfor more than a moment: but Venus, more harsh still, vouchsafes not evena moment\'s oblivion.\'\'Glaucus is never at a loss for fair words.\'\'Who is, when the object of them is so fair?\'\'We shall see you both at my father\'s villa soon,\' said Julia, turningto Clodius.\'We will mark the day in which we visit you with a white stone,\'answered the gamester.Julia dropped her veil, but slowly, so that her last glance rested onthe Athenian with affected timidity and real boldness; the glancebespoke tenderness and reproach.The friends passed on.\'Julia is certainly handsome,\' said Glaucus.\'And last year you would have made that confession in a warmer tone.\'\'True; I was dazzled at the first sight, and mistook for a gem thatwhich was but an artful imitation.\'\'Nay,\' returned Clodius, \'all women are the same at heart.  Happy he whoweds a handsome face and a large dower.  What more can he desire?\'Glaucus sighed.They were now in a street less crowded than the rest, at the end ofwhich they beheld that broad and most lovely sea, which upon thosedelicious coasts seems to have renounced its prerogative of terror--sosoft are the crisping winds that hover around its bosom, so glowing andso various are the hues which it takes from the rosy clouds, so fragrantare the perfumes which the breezes from the land scatter over itsdepths.  From such a sea might you well believe that Aphrodite rose totake the empire of the earth.\'It is still early for the bath,\' said the Greek, who was the creatureof every poetical impulse; \'let us wander from the crowded city, andlook upon the sea while the noon yet laughs along its billows.\'\'With all my heart,\' said Clodius; \'and the bay, too, is always the mostanimated part of the city.\'Pompeii was the miniature of the civilization of that age. Within thenarrow compass of its walls was contained, as it were, a specimen ofevery gift which luxury offered to power.  In its minute but glitteringshops, its tiny palaces, its baths, its forum, its theatre, itscircus--in the energy yet corruption, in the refinement yet the vice, ofits people, you beheld a model of the whole empire. It was a toy, aplaything, a showbox, in which the gods seemed pleased to keep therepresentation of the great monarchy of earth, and which they afterwardshid from time, to give to the wonder of posterity--the moral of themaxim, that under the sun there is nothing new.Crowded in the glassy bay were the vessels of commerce and the gildedgalleys for the pleasures of the rich citizens.  The boats of thefishermen glided rapidly to and fro; and afar off you saw the tall mastsof the fleet under the command of Pliny.  Upon the shore sat a Sicilianwho, with vehement gestures and flexile features, was narrating to agroup of fishermen and peasants a strange tale of shipwrecked marinersand friendly dolphins--just as at this day, in the modern neighborhood,you may hear upon the Mole of Naples.Drawing his comrade from the crowd, the Greek bent his steps towards asolitary part of the beach, and the two friends, seated on a small cragwhich rose amidst the smooth pebbles, inhaled the voluptuous and coolingbreeze, which dancing over the waters, kept music with its invisiblefeet. There was, perhaps, something in the scene that invited them tosilence and reverie.  Clodius, shading his eyes from the burning sky,was calculating the gains of the last week; and the Greek, leaning uponhis hand, and shrinking not from that sun--his nation\'s tutelarydeity--with whose fluent light of poesy, and joy, and love, his ownveins were filled, gazed upon the broad expanse, and envied, perhaps,every wind that bent its pinions towards the shores of Greece.\'Tell me, Clodius,\' said the Greek at last, \'hast thou ever been inlove?\'\'Yes, very often.\'\'He who has loved often,\' answered Glaucus, \'has loved never. There isbut one Eros, though there are many counterfeits of him.\'\'The counterfeits are not bad little gods, upon the whole,\' answeredClodius.\'I agree with you,\' returned the Greek.  \'I adore even the shadow ofLove; but I adore himself yet more.\'\'Art thou, then, soberly and honestly in love?  Hast thou that feelingwhich the poets describe--a feeling that makes us neglect our suppers,forswear the theatre, and write elegies?  I should never have thoughtit.  You dissemble well.\'\'I am not far gone enough for that,\' returned Glaucus, smiling, \'orrather I say with Tibullus--He whom love rules, where\'er his path may be, Walks safe and sacred.In fact, I am not in love; but I could be if there were but occasion tosee the object.  Eros would light his torch, but the priests have givenhim no oil.\'\'Shall I guess the object?--Is it not Diomed\'s daughter?  She adoresyou, and does not affect to conceal it; and, by Hercules, I say againand again, she is both handsome and rich.  She will bind the door-postsof her husband with golden fillets.\'\'No, I do not desire to sell myself.  Diomed\'s daughter is handsome, Igrant: and at one time, had she not been the grandchild of a freedman, Imight have...  Yet no--she carries all her beauty in her face; hermanners are not maiden-like, and her mind knows no culture save that ofpleasure.\'\'You are ungrateful.  Tell me, then, who is the fortunate virgin?\'\'You shall hear, my Clodius.  Several months ago I was sojourning atNeapolis, a city utterly to my own heart, for it still retains themanners and stamp of its Grecian origin--and it yet merits the name ofParthenope, from its delicious air and its beautiful shores. One day Ientered the temple of Minerva, to offer up my prayers, not for myselfmore than for the city on which Pallas smiles no longer. The temple wasempty and deserted. The recollections of Athens crowded fast andmeltingly upon me: imagining myself still alone in the temple, andabsorbed in the earnestness of my devotion, my prayer gushed from myheart to my lips, and I wept as I prayed. I was startled in the midst ofmy devotions, however, by a deep sigh; I turned suddenly round, and justbehind me was a female.  She had raised her veil also in prayer: andwhen our eyes met, methought a celestial ray shot from those dark andsmiling orbs at once into my soul.  Never, my Clodius, have I seenmortal face more exquisitely molded: a certain melancholy softened andyet elevated its expression: that unutterable something, which springsfrom the soul, and which our sculptors have imparted to the aspect ofPsyche, gave her beauty I know not what of divine and noble; tears wererolling down her eyes.  I guessed at once that she was also of Athenianlineage; and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded tomine. I spoke to her, though with a faltering voice--""Art thou not, too,Athenian?"" said I, ""O beautiful virgin!"" At the sound of my voice sheblushed, and half drew her veil across her face.--""My forefathers\'ashes,"" said she, ""repose by the waters of Ilissus: my birth is ofNeapolis; but my heart, as my lineage, is Athenian.""--""Let us, then,""said I, ""make our offerings together"": and, as the priest now appeared,we stood side by side, while we followed the priest in his ceremonialprayer; together we touched the knees of the goddess--together we laidour olive garlands on the altar. I felt a strange emotion of almostsacred tenderness at this companionship. We, strangers from a far andfallen land, stood together and alone in that temple of our country\'sdeity: was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman,for so I might surely call her?  I felt as if I had known her for years;and that simple rite seemed, as by a miracle, to operate on thesympathies and ties of time.  Silently we left the temple, and I wasabout to ask her where she dwelt, and if I might be permitted to visither, when a youth, in whose features there was some kindred resemblanceto her own, and who stood upon the steps of the fane, took her by thehand.  She turned round and bade me farewell.  The crowd separated us: Isaw her no more.  On reaching my home I found letters, which obliged meto set out for Athens, for my relations threatened me with litigationconcerning my inheritance. When that suit was happily over, I repairedonce more to Neapolis; I instituted inquiries throughout the whole city,I could discover no clue of my lost countrywoman, and, hoping to lose ingaiety all remembrance of that beautiful apparition, I hastened toplunge myself amidst the luxuries of Pompeii.  This is all my history.I do not love; but I remember and regret.\'As Clodius was about to reply, a slow and stately step approached them,and at the sound it made amongst the pebbles, each turned, and eachrecognized the new-comer.It was a man who had scarcely reached his fortieth year, of tallstature, and of a thin but nervous and sinewy frame.  His skin, dark andbronzed, betrayed his Eastern origin; and his features had somethingGreek in their outline (especially in the chin, the lip, and the brow),save that the nose was somewhat raised and aquiline; and the bones, hardand visible, forbade that fleshy and waving contour which on the Grecianphysiognomy preserved even in manhood the round and beautiful curves ofyouth.  His eyes, large and black as the deepest night, shone with novarying and uncertain lustre. A deep, thoughtful, and half-melancholycalm seemed unalterably fixed in their majestic and commanding gaze.His step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty, and somethingforeign in the fashion and the sober hues of his sweeping garments addedto the impressive effect of his quiet countenance and stately form.Each of the young men, in saluting the new-comer, made mechanically, andwith care to conceal it from him, a slight gesture or sign with theirfingers; for Arbaces, the Egyptian, was supposed to possess the fatalgift of the evil eye.\'The scene must, indeed, be beautiful,\' said Arbaces, with a cold thoughcourteous smile, \'which draws the gay Clodius, and Glaucus the alladmired, from the crowded thoroughfares of the city.\'\'Is Nature ordinarily so unattractive?\' asked the Greek.\'To the dissipated--yes.\'\'An austere reply, but scarcely a wise one.  Pleasure delights incontrasts; it is from dissipation that we learn to enjoy solitude, andfrom solitude dissipation.\'\'So think the young philosophers of the Garden,\' replied the Egyptian;\'they mistake lassitude for meditation, and imagine that, because theyare sated with others, they know the delight of loneliness.  But not insuch jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone drawsfrom her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty: she demands fromyou, not the exhaustion of passion, but all that fervor, from which youonly seek, in adoring her, a release.  When, young Athenian, the moonrevealed herself in visions of light to Endymion, it was after a daypassed, not amongst the feverish haunts of men, but on the stillmountains and in the solitary valleys of the hunter.\'\'Beautiful simile!\' cried Glaucus; \'most unjust application! Exhaustion!that word is for age, not youth.  By me, at least, one moment of satietyhas never been known!\'Again the Egyptian smiled, but his smile was cold and blighting, andeven the unimaginative Clodius froze beneath its light.  He did not,however, reply to the passionate exclamation of Glaucus; but, after apause, he said, in a soft and melancholy voice:\'After all, you do right to enjoy the hour while it smiles for you; therose soon withers, the perfume soon exhales.  And we, O Glaucus!strangers in the land and far from our fathers\' ashes, what is thereleft for us but pleasure or regret!--for you the first, perhaps for methe last.\'The bright eyes of the Greek were suddenly suffused with tears. \'Ah,speak not, Arbaces,\' he cried--\'speak not of our ancestors.  Let usforget that there were ever other liberties than those of Rome!  AndGlory!--oh, vainly would we call her ghost from the fields of Marathonand Thermopylae!\'\'Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest,\' said the Egyptian; \'and inthy gaieties this night, thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than ofLais. Vale!\'Thus saying, he gathered his robe around him, and slowly swept away.\'I breathe more freely,\' said Clodius.  \'Imitating the Egyptians, wesometimes introduce a skeleton at our feasts.  In truth, the presence ofsuch an Egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre enough to sour therichest grape of the Falernian.\'\'Strange man! said Glaucus, musingly; \'yet dead though he seem topleasure, and cold to the objects of the world, scandal belies him, orhis house and his heart could tell a different tale.\'\'Ah! there are whispers of other orgies than those of Osiris in hisgloomy mansion.  He is rich, too, they say.  Can we not get him amongstus, and teach him the charms of dice?  Pleasure of pleasures! hot feverof hope and fear! inexpressible unjaded passion! how fiercely beautifulthou art, O Gaming!\'\'Inspired--inspired!\' cried Glaucus, laughing; \'the oracle speaks poetryin Clodius.  What miracle next!\'Chapter IIIPARENTAGE OF GLAUCUS.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES OF POMPEII. CLASSICREVEL.HEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one: it had given himbeauty, health, fortune, genius, illustrious descent, a heart of fire, amind of poetry; but it had denied him the heritage of freedom. He wasborn in Athens, the subject of Rome.  Succeeding early to an ampleinheritance, he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural tothe young, and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasureamidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court.He was an Alcibiades without ambition.  He was what a man ofimagination, youth, fortune, and talents, readily becomes when youdeprive him of the inspiration of glory.  His house at Rome was thetheme of the debauchees, but also of the lovers of art; and thesculptors of Greece delighted to task their skill in adorning theporticoes and exedrae of an Athenian.  His retreat in Pompeii--alas! thecolors are faded now, the walls stripped of their paintings!--its mainbeauty, its elaborate finish of grace and ornament, is gone; yet whenfirst given once more to the day, what eulogies, what wonder, did itsminute and glowing decorations create--its paintings--its mosaics!Passionately enamoured of poetry and the drama, which recalled toGlaucus the wit and the heroism of his race, that fairy mansion wasadorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer.  And antiquaries,who resolve taste to a trade, have turned the patron to the professor,and still (though the error is now acknowledged) they style in custom,as they first named in mistake, the disburied house of the AthenianGlaucus \'THE HOUSE OF THE DRAMATIC POET\'.Previous to our description of this house, it may be as well to conveyto the reader a general notion of the houses of Pompeii, which he willfind to resemble strongly the plans of Vitruvius; but with all thosedifferences in detail, of caprice and taste, which being natural tomankind, have always puzzled antiquaries.  We shall endeavor to makethis description as clear and unpedantic as possible.You enter then, usually, by a small entrance-passage (calledcestibulum), into a hall, sometimes with (but more frequently without)the ornament of columns; around three sides of this hall are doorscommunicating with several bedchambers (among which is the porter\'s),the best of these being usually appropriated to country visitors.  Atthe extremity of the hall, on either side to the right and left, if thehouse is large, there are two small recesses, rather than chambers,generally devoted to the ladies of the mansion; and in the centre of thetessellated pavement of the hall is invariably a square, shallowreservoir for rain water (classically termed impluvium), which wasadmitted by an aperture in the roof above; the said aperture beingcovered at will by an awning.  Near this impluvium, which had a peculiarsanctity in the eyes of the ancients, were sometimes (but at Pompeiimore rarely than at Rome) placed images of the household gods--thehospitable hearth, often mentioned by the Roman poets, and consecratedto the Lares, was at Pompeii almost invariably formed by a movablebrazier; while in some corner, often the most ostentatious place, wasdeposited a huge wooden chest, ornamented and strengthened by bands ofbronze or iron, and secured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal sofirmly as to defy the attempts of any robber to detach it from itsposition. It is supposed that this chest was the money-box, or coffer,of the master of the house; though as no money has been found in any ofthe chests discovered at Pompeii, it is probable that it was sometimesrather designed for ornament than use.In this hall (or atrium, to speak classically) the clients and visitorsof inferior rank were usually received.  In the houses of the more\'respectable\', an atriensis, or slave peculiarly devoted to the serviceof the hall, was invariably retained, and his rank among hisfellow-slaves was high and important.  The reservoir in the centre musthave been rather a dangerous ornament, but the centre of the hall waslike the grass-plot of a college, and interdicted to the passers to andfro, who found ample space in the margin.  Right opposite the entrance,at the other end of the hall, was an apartment (tablinum), in which thepavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics, and the walls coveredwith elaborate paintings.  Here were usually kept the records of thefamily, or those of any public office that had been filled by the owner:on one side of this saloon, if we may so call it, was often adining-room, or triclinium; on the other side, perhaps, what we shouldnow term a cabinet of gems, containing whatever curiosities were deemedmost rare and costly; and invariably a small passage for the slaves tocross to the further parts of the house, without passing the apartmentsthus mentioned.  These rooms all opened on a square or oblong colonnade,technically termed peristyle.  If the house was small, its boundaryceased with this colonnade; and in that case its centre, howeverdiminutive, was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a garden, andadorned with vases of flowers, placed upon pedestals: while, under thecolonnade, to the right and left, were doors admitting to bedrooms, to asecond triclinium, or eating-room (for the ancients generallyappropriated two rooms at least to that purpose, one for summer, and onefor winter--or, perhaps, one for ordinary, the other for festive,occasions); and if the owner affected letters, a cabinet, dignified bythe name of library--for a very small room was sufficient to contain thefew rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable collection ofbooks.At the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen.  Supposing thehouse was large, it did not end with the peristyle, and the centrethereof was not in that case a garden, but might be, perhaps, adornedwith a fountain, or basin for fish; and at its end, exactly opposite tothe tablinum, was generally another eating-room, on either side of whichwere bedrooms, and, perhaps, a picture-saloon, or pinacotheca.  Theseapartments communicated again with a square or oblong space, usuallyadorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle, and verymuch resembling the peristyle, only usually longer.  This was the properviridarium, or garden, being commonly adorned with a fountain, orstatues, and a profusion of gay flowers: at its extreme end was thegardener\'s house; on either side, beneath the colonnade, were sometimes,if the size of the family required it, additional rooms.At Pompeii, a second or third story was rarely of importance, beingbuilt only above a small part of the house, and containing rooms for theslaves; differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices ofRome, which generally contained the principal eating-room (orcaenaculum) on the second floor.  The apartments themselves wereordinarily of small size; for in those delightful climes they receivedany extraordinary number of visitors in the peristyle (or portico), thehall, or the garden; and even their banquet-rooms, however elaboratelyadorned and carefully selected in point of aspect, were of diminutiveproportions; for the intellectual ancients, being fond of society, notof crowds, rarely feasted more than nine at a time, so that largedinner-rooms were not so necessary with them as with us. But the suiteof rooms seen at once from the entrance, must have had a very imposingeffect: you beheld at once the hall richly paved and painted--thetablinum--the graceful peristyle, and (if the house extended farther)the opposite banquet-room and the garden, which closed the view withsome gushing fount or marble statue.The reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses,which resembled in some respects the Grecian, but mostly the Romanfashion of domestic architecture.  In almost every house there is somedifference in detail from the rest, but the principal outline is thesame in all.  In all you find the hall, the tablinum, and the peristyle,communicating with each other; in all you find the walls richly painted;and all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegancies oflife.  The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is,however, questionable: they were fond of the gaudiest colors, offantastic designs; they often painted the lower half of their columns abright red, leaving the rest uncolored; and where the garden was small,its wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent,imitating trees, birds, temples, etc., in perspective--a meretriciousdelusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted, with acomplacent pride in its ingenuity.But the house of Glaucus was at once one of the smallest, and yet one ofthe most adorned and finished of all the private mansions of Pompeii: itwould be a model at this day for the house of \'a single man inMayfair\'--the envy and despair of the coelibian purchasers of buhland marquetry.You enter by a long and narrow vestibule, on the floor of which is theimage of a dog in mosaic, with the well-known \'Cave canem\'--or \'Bewarethe dog\'. On either side is a chamber of some size; for the interiorpart of the house not being large enough to contain the two greatdivisions of private and public apartments, these two rooms were setapart for the reception of visitors who neither by rank nor familiaritywere entitled to admission in the penetralia of the mansion.Advancing up the vestibule you enter an atrium, that when firstdiscovered was rich in paintings, which in point of expression wouldscarcely disgrace a Rafaele.  You may see them now transplanted to theNeapolitan Museum: they are still the admiration of connoisseurs--theydepict the parting of Achilles and Briseis.  Who does not acknowledgethe force, the vigour, the beauty, employed in delineating the forms andfaces of Achilles and the immortal slave!On one side the atrium, a small staircase admitted to the apartments forthe slaves on the second floor; there also were two or three smallbedrooms, the walls of which portrayed the rape of Europa, the battle ofthe Amazons, etc.You now enter the tablinum, across which, at either end, hung richdraperies of Tyrian purple, half withdrawn.  On the walls was depicted apoet reading his verses to his friends; and in the pavement was inserteda small and most exquisite mosaic, typical of the instructions given bythe director of the stage to his comedians.You passed through this saloon and entered the peristyle; and here (as Ihave said before was usually the case with the smaller houses ofPompeii) the mansion ended.  From each of the seven columns that adornedthis court hung festoons of garlands: the centre, supplying the place ofa garden, bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of whitemarble, that were supported on pedestals.  At the left hand of thissmall garden was a diminutive fane, resembling one of those smallchapels placed at the side of roads in Catholic countries, and dedicatedto the Penates; before it stood a bronzed tripod: to the left of thecolonnade were two small cubicula, or bedrooms; to the right was thetriclinium, in which the guests were now assembled.This room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples \'The Chamber ofLeda\'; and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell, the reader willfind an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Ledapresenting her newborn to her husband, from which the room derives itsname. This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden.  Roundthe table of citrean wood, highly polished and delicately wrought withsilver arabesques, were placed the three couches, which were yet morecommon at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately intofashion at Rome: and on these couches of bronze, studded with richermetals, were laid thick quiltings covered with elaborate broidery, andyielding luxuriously to the pressure.\'Well, I must own,\' said the aedile Pansa, \'that your house, thoughscarcely larger than a case for one\'s fibulae, is a gem of its kind.How beautifully painted is that parting of Achilles and Briseis!--what astyle!--what heads!--what a-hem!\'\'Praise from Pansa is indeed valuable on such subjects,\' said Clodius,gravely.  \'Why, the paintings on his walls!--Ah! there is, indeed, thehand of a Zeuxis!\'\'You flatter me, my Clodius; indeed you do,\' quoth the aedile, who wascelebrated through Pompeii for having the worst paintings in the world;for he was patriotic, and patronized none but Pompeians.  \'You flatterme; but there is something pretty--AEdepol, yes--in the colors, to saynothing of the design--and then for the kitchen, my friends--ah! thatwas all my fancy.\'\'What is the design?\' said Glaucus.  \'I have not yet seen your kitchen,though I have often witnessed the excellence of its cheer.\'\'A cook, my Athenian--a cook sacrificing the trophies of his skill onthe altar of Vesta, with a beautiful muraena (taken from the life) on aspit at a distance--there is some invention there!\'At that instant the slaves appeared, bearing a tray covered with thefirst preparative initia of the feast.  Amidst delicious figs, freshherbs strewed with snow, anchovies, and eggs, were ranged small cups ofdiluted wine sparingly mixed with honey.  As these were placed on thetable, young slaves bore round to each of the five guests (for therewere no more) the silver basin of perfumed water, and napkins edged witha purple fringe.  But the aedile ostentatiously drew forth his ownnapkin, which was not, indeed, of so fine a linen, but in which thefringe was twice as broad, and wiped his hands with the parade of a manwho felt he was calling for admiration.\'A splendid nappa that of yours,\' said Clodius; \'why, the fringe is asbroad as a girdle!\'\'A trifle, my Clodius: a trifle!  They tell me this stripe is the latestfashion at Rome; but Glaucus attends to these things more than I.\'\'Be propitious, O Bacchus!\' said Glaucus, inclining reverentially to abeautiful image of the god placed in the centre of the table, at thecorners of which stood the Lares and the salt-holders.  The guestsfollowed the prayer, and then, sprinkling the wine on the table, theyperformed the wonted libation.This over, the convivialists reclined themselves on the couches, and thebusiness of the hour commenced.\'May this cup be my last!\' said the young Sallust, as the table, clearedof its first stimulants, was now loaded with the substantial part of theentertainment, and the ministering slave poured forth to him a brimmingcyathus--\'May this cup be my last, but it is the best wine I have drunkat Pompeii!\'\'Bring hither the amphora,\' said Glaucus, \'and read its date and itscharacter.\'The slave hastened to inform the party that the scroll fastened to thecork betokened its birth from Chios, and its age a ripe fifty years.\'How deliciously the snow has cooled it!\' said Pansa.  \'It is justenough.\'\'It is like the experience of a man who has cooled his pleasuressufficiently to give them a double zest,\' exclaimed Sallust.\'It is like a woman\'s ""No"",\' added Glaucus: \'it cools, but to inflamethe more.\'\'When is our next wild-beast fight?\' said Clodius to Pansa.\'It stands fixed for the ninth ide of August,\' answered Pansa: \'on theday after the Vulcanalia--we have a most lovely young lion for theoccasion.\'\'Whom shall we get for him to eat?\' asked Clodius.  \'Alas! there is agreat scarcity of criminals.  You must positively find some innocent orother to condemn to the lion, Pansa!\'\'Indeed I have thought very seriously about it of late,\' replied theaedile, gravely.  \'It was a most infamous law that which forbade us tosend our own slaves to the wild beasts.  Not to let us do what we likewith our own, that\'s what I call an infringement on property itself.\'\'Not so in the good old days of the Republic,\' sighed Sallust.\'And then this pretended mercy to the slaves is such a disappointment tothe poor people.  How they do love to see a good tough battle between aman and a lion; and all this innocent pleasure they may lose (if thegods don\'t send us a good criminal soon) from this cursed law!\'\'What can be worse policy,\' said Clodius, sententiously, \'than tointerfere with the manly amusements of the people?\'\'Well thank Jupiter and the Fates! we have no Nero at present,\' saidSallust.\'He was, indeed, a tyrant; he shut up our amphitheatre for ten years.\'\'I wonder it did not create a rebellion,\' said Sallust.\'It very nearly did,\' returned Pansa, with his mouth full of wild boar.Here the conversation was interrupted for a moment by a flourish offlutes, and two slaves entered with a single dish.\'Ah, what delicacy hast thou in store for us now, my Glaucus?\' cried theyoung Sallust, with sparkling eyes.Sallust was only twenty-four, but he had no pleasure in life likeeating--perhaps he had exhausted all the others: yet had he some talent,and an excellent heart--as far as it went.\'I know its face, by Pollux!\' cried Pansa.  \'It is an Ambracian Kid.  Ho(snapping his fingers, a usual signal to the slaves) we must prepare anew libation in honour to the new-comer.\'\'I had hoped said Glaucus,\' in a melancholy tone, \'to have procured yousome oysters from Britain; but the winds that were so cruel to Caesarhave forbid us the oysters.\'\'Are they in truth so delicious?\' asked Lepidus, loosening to a yet moreluxurious ease his ungirdled tunic.\'Why, in truth, I suspect it is the distance that gives the flavor; theywant the richness of the Brundusium oyster.  But, at Rome, no supper iscomplete without them.\'\'The poor Britons!  There is some good in them after all,\' said Sallust.\'They produce an oyster.\'\'I wish they would produce us a gladiator,\' said the aedile, whoseprovident mind was musing over the wants of the amphitheatre.\'By Pallas!\' cried Glaucus, as his favorite slave crowned his streaminglocks with a new chaplet, \'I love these wild spectacles well enough whenbeast fights beast; but when a man, one with bones and blood like ours,is coldly put on the arena, and torn limb from limb, the interest is toohorrid: I sicken--I gasp for breath--I long to rush and defend him.  Theyells of the populace seem to me more dire than the voices of the Furieschasing Orestes.  I rejoice that there is so little chance of thatbloody exhibition for our next show!\'The aedile shrugged his shoulders.  The young Sallust, who was thoughtthe best-natured man in Pompeii, stared in surprise.  The gracefulLepidus, who rarely spoke for fear of disturbing his features,ejaculated \'Hercle!\' The parasite Clodius muttered \'AEdepol!\' and thesixth banqueter, who was the umbra of Clodius, and whose duty it was toecho his richer friend, when he could not praise him--the parasite of aparasite--muttered also \'AEdepol!\'\'Well, you Italians are used to these spectacles; we Greeks are moremerciful.  Ah, shade of Pindar!--the rapture of a true Grecian game--theemulation of man against man--the generous strife--the half-mournfultriumph--so proud to contend with a noble foe, so sad to see himovercome! But ye understand me not.\'\'The kid is excellent,\' said Sallust.  The slave, whose duty it was tocarve, and who valued himself on his science, had just performed thatoffice on the kid to the sound of music, his knife keeping time,beginning with a low tenor and accomplishing the arduous feat amidst amagnificent diapason.\'Your cook is, of course, from Sicily?\' said Pansa.\'Yes, of Syracuse.\'\'I will play you for him,\' said Clodius.  \'We will have a game betweenthe courses.\'\'Better that sort of game, certainly, than a beast fight; but I cannotstake my Sicilian--you have nothing so precious to stake me in return.\'\'My Phillida--my beautiful dancing-girl!\'\'I never buy women,\' said the Greek, carelessly rearranging his chaplet.The musicians, who were stationed in the portico without, had commencedtheir office with the kid; they now directed the melody into a moresoft, a more gay, yet it may be a more intellectual strain; and theychanted that song of Horace beginning \'Persicos odi\', etc., soimpossible to translate, and which they imagined applicable to a feastthat, effeminate as it seems to us, was simple enough for the gorgeousrevelry of the time.  We are witnessing the domestic, and not theprincely feast--the entertainment of a gentleman, not an emperor or asenator.\'Ah, good old Horace!\' said Sallust, compassionately; \'he sang well offeasts and girls, but not like our modern poets.\'\'The immortal Fulvius, for instance,\' said Clodius.\'Ah, Fulvius, the immortal!\' said the umbra.\'And Spuraena; and Caius Mutius, who wrote three epics in a year--couldHorace do that, or Virgil either said Lepidus.  \'Those old poets allfell into the mistake of copying sculpture instead of painting.Simplicity and repose--that was their notion; but we moderns have fire,and passion, and energy--we never sleep, we imitate the colors ofpainting, its life, and its action.  Immortal Fulvius!\'\'By the way,\' said Sallust, \'have you seen the new ode by Spuraena, inhonour of our Egyptian Isis?  It is magnificent--the true religiousfervor.\'\'Isis seems a favorite divinity at Pompeii,\' said Glaucus.\'Yes!\' said Pansa, \'she is exceedingly in repute just at this moment;her statue has been uttering the most remarkable oracles.  I am notsuperstitious, but I must confess that she has more than once assistedme materially in my magistracy with her advice.  Her priests are sopious, too! none of your gay, none of your proud, ministers of Jupiterand Fortune: they walk barefoot, eat no meat, and pass the greater partof the night in solitary devotion!\'\'An example to our other priesthoods, indeed!--Jupiter\'s temple wantsreforming sadly,\' said Lepidus, who was a great reformer for all buthimself.\'They say that Arbaces the Egyptian has imparted some most solemnmysteries to the priests of Isis,\' observed Sallust.  \'He boasts hisdescent from the race of Rameses, and declares that in his family thesecrets of remotest antiquity are treasured.\'\'He certainly possesses the gift of the evil eye,\' said Clodius. \'If Iever come upon that Medusa front without the previous charm, I am sureto lose a favorite horse, or throw the canes nine times running.\'\'The last would be indeed a miracle!\' said Sallust, gravely.\'How mean you, Sallust?\' returned the gamester, with a flushed brow.\'I mean, what you would leave me if I played often with you; and thatis--nothing.\'Clodius answered only by a smile of disdain.\'If Arbaces were not so rich,\' said Pansa, with a stately air, \'I shouldstretch my authority a little, and inquire into the truth of the reportwhich calls him an astrologer and a sorcerer.  Agrippa, when aedile ofRome, banished all such terrible citizens.  But a rich man--it is theduty of an aedile to protect the rich!\'\'What think you of this new sect, which I am told has even a fewproselytes in Pompeii, these followers of the Hebrew God--Christus?\'\'Oh, mere speculative visionaries,\' said Clodius; \'they have not asingle gentleman amongst them; their proselytes are poor, insignificant,ignorant people!\'\'Who ought, however, to be crucified for their blasphemy,\' said Pansa,with vehemence; \'they deny Venus and Jove!  Nazarene is but another namefor atheist.  Let me catch them--that\'s all.\'The second course was gone--the feasters fell back on theircouches--there was a pause while they listened to the soft voices of theSouth, and the music of the Arcadian reed.  Glaucus was the most raptand the least inclined to break the silence, but Clodius began alreadyto think that they wasted time.\'Bene vobis! (Your health!) my Glaucus,\' said he, quaffing a cup to eachletter of the Greek\'s name, with the ease of the practised drinker.\'Will you not be avenged on your ill-fortune of yesterday? See, the dicecourt us.\'\'As you will,\' said Glaucus.\'The dice in summer, and I an aedile!\' said Pansa, magisterially; \'it isagainst all law.\'\'Not in your presence, grave Pansa,\' returned Clodius, rattling the dicein a long box; \'your presence restrains all license: it is not thething, but the excess of the thing, that hurts.\'\'What wisdom!\' muttered the umbra.\'Well, I will look another way,\' said the aedile.\'Not yet, good Pansa; let us wait till we have supped,\' said Glaucus.Clodius reluctantly yielded, concealing his vexation with a yawn.\'He gapes to devour the gold,\' whispered Lepidus to Sallust, in aquotation from the Aulularia of Plautus.\'Ah! how well I know these polypi, who hold all they touch,\' answeredSallust, in the same tone, and out of the same play.The third course, consisting of a variety of fruits, pistachio nuts,sweetmeats, tarts, and confectionery tortured into a thousand fantasticand airy shapes, was now placed upon the table; and the ministri, orattendants, also set there the wine (which had hitherto been handedround to the guests) in large jugs of glass, each bearing upon it theschedule of its age and quality.\'Taste this Lesbian, my Pansa,\' said Sallust; \'it is excellent.\'\'It is not very old,\' said Glaucus, \'but it has been made precocious,like ourselves, by being put to the fire:--the wine to the flames ofVulcan--we to those of his wife--to whose honour I pour this cup.\'\'It is delicate,\' said Pansa, \'but there is perhaps the least particletoo much of rosin in its flavor.\'\'What a beautiful cup!\' cried Clodius, taking up one of transparentcrystal, the handles of which were wrought with gems, and twisted in theshape of serpents, the favorite fashion at Pompeii.\'This ring,\' said Glaucus, taking a costly jewel from the first joint ofhis finger and hanging it on the handle, \'gives it a richer show, andrenders it less unworthy of thy acceptance, my Clodius, on whom may thegods bestow health and fortune, long and oft to crown it to the brim!\'\'You are too generous, Glaucus,\' said the gamester, handing the cup tohis slave; \'but your love gives it a double value.\'\'This cup to the Graces!\' said Pansa, and he thrice emptied his calix.The guests followed his example.\'We have appointed no director to the feast,\' cried Sallust.\'Let us throw for him, then,\' said Clodius, rattling the dice-box.\'Nay,\' cried Glaucus, \'no cold and trite director for us: no dictator ofthe banquet; no rex convivii.  Have not the Romans sworn never to obey aking? Shall we be less free than your ancestors?  Ho! musicians, let ushave the song I composed the other night: it has a verse on thissubject, ""The Bacchic hymn of the Hours"".\'The musicians struck their instruments to a wild Ionic air, while theyoungest voice in the band chanted forth, in Greek words, as numbers,the following strain:--           THE EVENING HYMN OF THE HOURS                     I     Through the summer day, through the weary day,          We have glided long;      Ere we speed to the Night through her portals grey,          Hail us with song!--         With song, with song,        With a bright and joyous song;       Such as the Cretan maid,        While the twilight made her bolder,       Woke, high through the ivy shade,        When the wine-god first consoled her.       From the hush\'d, low-breathing skies,       Half-shut look\'d their starry eyes,          And all around,          With a loving sound,        The AEgean waves were creeping:       On her lap lay the lynx\'s head;       Wild thyme was her bridal bed;       And aye through each tiny space,       In the green vine\'s green embrace       The Fauns were slily peeping--       The Fauns, the prying Fauns--      The arch, the laughing Fauns--      The Fauns were slily peeping!                     II      Flagging and faint are we        With our ceaseless flight,       And dull shall our journey be        Through the realm of night,       Bathe us, O bathe our weary wings       In the purple wave, as it freshly springs        To your cups from the fount of light--    From the fount of light--from the fount of light,     For there, when the sun has gone down in night,         There in the bowl we find him.       The grape is the well of that summer sun,       Or rather the stream that he gazed upon,       Till he left in truth, like the Thespian youth,           His soul, as he gazed, behind him.                    III      A cup to Jove, and a cup to Love,        And a cup to the son of Maia;       And honour with three, the band zone-free,        The band of the bright Aglaia.       But since every bud in the wreath of pleasure        Ye owe to the sister Hours,       No stinted cups, in a formal measure,        The Bromian law makes ours.       He honors us most who gives us most,       And boasts, with a Bacchanal\'s honest boast,        He never will count the treasure.     Fastly we fleet, then seize our wings,     And plunge us deep in the sparkling springs;     And aye, as we rise with a dripping plume,     We\'ll scatter the spray round the garland\'s bloom;           We glow--we glow,     Behold, as the girls of the Eastern wave     Bore once with a shout to the crystal cave       The prize of the Mysian Hylas,           Even so--even so,     We have caught the young god in our warm embrace     We hurry him on in our laughing race;     We hurry him on, with a whoop and song,     The cloudy rivers of night along--      Ho, ho!--we have caught thee, Psilas!The guests applauded loudly.  When the poet is your host, his verses aresure to charm.\'Thoroughly Greek,\' said Lepidus: \'the wildness, force, and energy ofthat tongue, it is impossible to imitate in the Roman poetry.\'\'It is, indeed, a great contrast,\' said Clodius, ironically at heart,though not in appearance, \'to the old-fashioned and tame simplicity ofthat ode of Horace which we heard before.  The air is beautifully Ionic:the word puts me in mind of a toast--Companions, I give you thebeautiful Ione.\'\'Ione!--the name is Greek,\' said Glaucus, in a soft voice.  \'I drink thehealth with delight.  But who is Ione?\'\'Ah! you have but just come to Pompeii, or you would deserve ostracismfor your ignorance,\' said Lepidus, conceitedly; \'not to know Ione, isnot to know the chief charm of our city.\'\'She is of the most rare beauty,\' said Pansa; \'and what a voice!\'\'She can feed only on nightingales\' tongues,\' said Clodius.\'Nightingales\' tongues!--beautiful thought!\' sighed the umbra.\'Enlighten me, I beseech you,\' said Glaucus.\'Know then...\' began Lepidus.\'Let me speak,\' cried Clodius; \'you drawl out your words as if you spoketortoises.\'\'And you speak stones,\' muttered the coxcomb to himself, as he fell backdisdainfully on his couch.\'Know then, my Glaucus,\' said Clodius, \'that Ione is a stranger who hasbut lately come to Pompeii.  She sings like Sappho, and her songs areher own composing; and as for the tibia, and the cithara, and the lyre,I know not in which she most outdoes the Muses.  Her beauty is mostdazzling.  Her house is perfect; such taste--such gems--such bronzes!She is rich, and generous as she is rich.\'\'Her lovers, of course,\' said Glaucus, \'take care that she does notstarve; and money lightly won is always lavishly spent.\'\'Her lovers--ah, there is the enigma!--Ione has but one vice--she ischaste. She has all Pompeii at her feet, and she has no lovers: she willnot even marry.\'\'No lovers!\' echoed Glaucus.\'No; she has the soul of Vestal with the girdle of Venus.\'\'What refined expressions!\' said the umbra.\'A miracle!\' cried Glaucus.  \'Can we not see her?\'\'I will take you there this evening, said Clodius; \'meanwhile...\' addedhe, once more rattling the dice.\'I am yours!\' said the complaisant Glaucus.  \'Pansa, turn your face!\'Lepidus and Sallust played at odd and even, and the umbra looked on,while Glaucus and Clodius became gradually absorbed in the chances ofthe dice.\'By Pollux!\' cried Glaucus, \'this is the second time I have thrown thecaniculae\' (the lowest throw).\'Now Venus befriend me!\' said Clodius, rattling the box for severalmoments. \'O Alma Venus--it is Venus herself!\' as he threw the highestcast, named from that goddess--whom he who wins money, indeed, usuallypropitiates!\'Venus is ungrateful to me,\' said Glaucus, gaily; \'I have alwayssacrificed on her altar.\'\'He who plays with Clodius,\' whispered Lepidus, \'will soon, likePlautus\'s Curculio, put his pallium for the stakes.\'\'Poor Glaucus!--he is as blind as Fortune herself,\' replied Sallust, inthe same tone.\'I will play no more,\' said Glaucus; \'I have lost thirty sestertia.\'\'I am sorry...\' began Clodius.\'Amiable man!\' groaned the umbra.\'Not at all!\' exclaimed Glaucus; \'the pleasure I take in your gaincompensates the pain of my loss.\'The conversation now grew general and animated; the wine circulated morefreely; and Ione once more became the subject of eulogy to the guests ofGlaucus.\'Instead of outwatching the stars, let us visit one at whose beauty thestars grow pale,\' said Lepidus.Clodius, who saw no chance of renewing the dice, seconded the proposal;and Glaucus, though he civilly pressed his guests to continue thebanquet, could not but let them see that his curiosity had been excitedby the praises of Ione: they therefore resolved to adjourn (all, atleast, but Pansa and the umbra) to the house of the fair Greek.  Theydrank, therefore, to the health of Glaucus and of Titus--they performedtheir last libation--they resumed their slippers--they descended thestairs--passed the illumined atrium--and walking unbitten over thefierce dog painted on the threshold, found themselves beneath the lightof the moon just risen, in the lively and still crowded streets ofPompeii.They passed the jewellers\' quarter, sparkling with lights, caught andreflected by the gems displayed in the shops, and arrived at last at thedoor of Ione.  The vestibule blazed with rows of lamps; curtains ofembroidered purple hung on either aperture of the tablinum, whose wallsand mosaic pavement glowed with the richest colors of the artist; andunder the portico which surrounded the odorous viridarium they foundIone, already surrounded by adoring and applauding guests!\'Did you say she was Athenian?\' whispered Glaucus, ere he passed intothe peristyle.\'No, she is from Neapolis.\'\'Neapolis!\' echoed Glaucus; and at that moment the group, dividing oneither side of Ione, gave to his view that bright, that nymph-likebeauty, which for months had shone down upon the waters of his memory.Chapter IVTHE TEMPLE OF ISIS.  ITS PRIEST.  THE CHARACTER OF ARBACES DEVELOPSITSELF.THE story returns to the Egyptian.  We left Arbaces upon the shores ofthe noonday sea, after he had parted from Glaucus and his companion.  Ashe approached to the more crowded part of the bay, he paused and gazedupon that animated scene with folded arms, and a bitter smile upon hisdark features.\'Gulls, dupes, fools, that ye are!\' muttered he to himself; \'whetherbusiness or pleasure, trade or religion, be your pursuit, you areequally cheated by the passions that ye should rule!  How I could loatheyou, if I did not hate--yes, hate!  Greek or Roman, it is from us, fromthe dark lore of Egypt, that ye have stolen the fire that gives yousouls.  Your knowledge--your poesy--your laws--your arts--your barbarousmastery of war (all how tame and mutilated, when compared with the vastoriginal!)--ye have filched, as a slave filches the fragments of thefeast, from us!  And now, ye mimics of a mimic!--Romans, forsooth! themushroom herd of robbers! ye are our masters! the pyramids look down nomore on the race of Rameses--the eagle cowers over the serpent of theNile.  Our masters--no, not mine.  My soul, by the power of its wisdom,controls and chains you, though the fetters are unseen.  So long ascraft can master force, so long as religion has a cave from whichoracles can dupe mankind, the wise hold an empire over earth.  Even fromyour vices Arbaces distills his pleasures--pleasures unprofaned byvulgar eyes--pleasures vast, wealthy, inexhaustible, of which yourenervate minds, in their unimaginative sensuality, cannot conceive ordream!  Plod on, plod on, fools of ambition and of avarice! your pettythirst for fasces and quaestorships, and all the mummery of servilepower, provokes my laughter and my scorn.  My power can extend whereverman believes.  I ride over the souls that the purple veils.  Thebes mayfall, Egypt be a name; the world itself furnishes the subjects ofArbaces.\'Thus saying, the Egyptian moved slowly on; and, entering the town, histall figure towered above the crowded throng of the forum, and swepttowards the small but graceful temple consecrated to Isis.That edifice was then but of recent erection; the ancient temple hadbeen thrown down in the earthquake sixteen years before, and the newbuilding had become as much in vogue with the versatile Pompeians as anew church or a new preacher may be with us.  The oracles of the goddessat Pompeii were indeed remarkable, not more for the mysterious languagein which they were clothed, than for the credit which was attached totheir mandates and predictions.  If they were not dictated by adivinity, they were framed at least by a profound knowledge of mankind;they applied themselves exactly to the circumstances of individuals, andmade a notable contrast to the vague and loose generalities of theirrival temples.  As Arbaces now arrived at the rails which separated theprofane from the sacred place, a crowd, composed of all classes, butespecially of the commercial, collected, breathless and reverential,before the many altars which rose in the open court.  In the walls ofthe cella, elevated on seven steps of Parian marble, various statuesstood in niches, and those walls were ornamented with the pomegranateconsecrated to Isis.  An oblong pedestal occupied the interior building,on which stood two statues, one of Isis, and its companion representedthe silent and mystic Orus.  But the building contained many otherdeities to grace the court of the Egyptian deity: her kindred andmany-titled Bacchus, and the Cyprian Venus, a Grecian disguise forherself, rising from her bath, and the dog-headed Anubis, and the oxApis, and various Egyptian idols of uncouth form and unknownappellations.But we must not suppose that among the cities of Magna Graecia, Isis wasworshipped with those forms and ceremonies which were of right her own.The mongrel and modern nations of the South, with a mingled arroganceand ignorance, confounded the worships of all climes and ages.  And theprofound mysteries of the Nile were degraded by a hundred meretriciousand frivolous admixtures from the creeds of Cephisus and of Tibur.  Thetemple of Isis in Pompeii was served by Roman and Greek priests,ignorant alike of the language and the customs of her ancient votaries;and the descendant of the dread Egyptian kings, beneath the appearanceof reverential awe, secretly laughed to scorn the puny mummeries whichimitated the solemn and typical worship of his burning clime.Ranged now on either side the steps was the sacrificial crowd, arrayedin white garments, while at the summit stood two of the inferiorpriests, the one holding a palm branch, the other a slender sheaf ofcorn.  In the narrow passage in front thronged the bystanders.\'And what,\' whispered Arbaces to one of the bystanders, who was amerchant engaged in the Alexandrian trade, which trade had probablyfirst introduced in Pompeii the worship of the Egyptian goddess--\'whatoccasion now assembles you before the altars of the venerable Isis?  Itseems, by the white robes of the group before me, that a sacrifice is tobe rendered; and by the assembly of the priests, that ye are preparedfor some oracle.  To what question is it to vouchsafe a reply?\'\'We are merchants,\' replied the bystander (who was no other than Diomed)in the same voice, \'who seek to know the fate of our vessels, which sailfor Alexandria to-morrow.  We are about to offer up a sacrifice andimplore an answer from the goddess.  I am not one of those who havepetitioned the priest to sacrifice, as you may see by my dress, but Ihave some interest in the success of the fleet--by Jupiter! yes.  I havea pretty trade, else how could I live in these hard times?The Egyptian replied gravely--\'That though Isis was properly the goddessof agriculture, she was no less the patron of commerce.\' Then turninghis head towards the east, Arbaces seemed absorbed in silent prayer.And now in the centre of the steps appeared a priest robed in white fromhead to foot, the veil parting over the crown; two new priests relievedthose hitherto stationed at either corner, being naked half-way down tothe breast, and covered, for the rest, in white and loose robes.  At thesame time, seated at the bottom of the steps, a priest commenced asolemn air upon a long wind-instrument of music.  Half-way down thesteps stood another flamen, holding in one hand the votive wreath, inthe other a white wand; while, adding to the picturesque scene of thateastern ceremony, the stately ibis (bird sacred to the Egyptian worship)looked mutely down from the wall upon the rite, or stalked beside thealtar at the base of the steps.At that altar now stood the sacrificial flamen.The countenance of Arbaces seemed to lose all its rigid calm while thearuspices inspected the entrails, and to be intent in pious anxiety--torejoice and brighten as the signs were declared favorable, and the firebegan bright and clearly to consume the sacred portion of the victimamidst odorous of myrrh and frankincense.  It was then that a deadsilence fell over the whispering crowd, and the priests gathering roundthe cella, another priest, naked save by a cincture round the middle,rushed forward, and dancing with wild gestures, implored an answer fromthe goddess.  He ceased at last in exhaustion, and a low murmuring noisewas heard within the body of the statue: thrice the head moved, and thelips parted, and then a hollow voice uttered these mystic words:  There are waves like chargers that meet and glow,  There are graves ready wrought in the rocks below,  On the brow of the future the dangers lour,  But blest are your barks in the fearful hour.The voice ceased--the crowd breathed more freely--the merchants lookedat each other.  \'Nothing can be more plain,\' murmured Diomed; \'there isto be a storm at sea, as there very often is at the beginning of autumn,but our vessels are to be saved.  O beneficent Isis!\'\'Lauded eternally be the goddess!\' said the merchants: \'what can be lessequivocal than her prediction?\'Raising one hand in sign of silence to the people, for the rites of Isisenjoined what to the lively Pompeians was an impossible suspense fromthe use of the vocal organs, the chief priest poured his libation on thealtar, and after a short concluding prayer the ceremony was over, andthe congregation dismissed.  Still, however, as the crowd dispersedthemselves here and there, the Egyptian lingered by the railing, andwhen the space became tolerably cleared, one of the priests, approachingit, saluted him with great appearance of friendly familiarity.The countenance of the priest was remarkably unprepossessing--his shavenskull was so low and narrow in the front as nearly to approach to theconformation of that of an African savage, save only towards thetemples, where, in that organ styled acquisitiveness by the pupils of ascience modern in name, but best practically known (as their sculptureteaches us) amongst the ancients, two huge and almost preternaturalprotuberances yet more distorted the unshapely head--around the browsthe skin was puckered into a web of deep and intricate wrinkles--theeyes, dark and small, rolled in a muddy and yellow orbit--the nose,short yet coarse, was distended at the nostrils like a satyr\'s--and thethick but pallid lips, the high cheek-bones, the livid and motley huesthat struggled through the parchment skin, completed a countenance whichnone could behold without repugnance, and few without terror anddistrust: whatever the wishes of the mind, the animal frame was wellfitted to execute them; the wiry muscles of the throat, the broad chest,the nervous hands and lean gaunt arms, which were bared above the elbow,betokened a form capable alike of great active exertion and passiveendurance.\'Calenus,\' said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen, \'you haveimproved the voice of the statue much by attending to my suggestion; andyour verses are excellent.  Always prophesy good fortune, unless thereis an absolute impossibility of its fulfilment.\'\'Besides,\' added Calenus, \'if the storm does come, and if it doesoverwhelm the accursed ships, have we not prophesied it? and are thebarks not blest to be at rest?--for rest prays the mariner in the AEgeansea, or at least so says Horace--can the mariner be more at rest in thesea than when he is at the bottom of it?\'\'Right, my Calenus; I wish Apaecides would take a lesson from yourwisdom. But I desire to confer with you relative to him and to othermatters: you can admit me into one of your less sacred apartments?\'\'Assuredly,\' replied the priest, leading the way to one of the smallchambers which surrounded the open gate.  Here they seated themselvesbefore a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs, andvarious cold meats, with vases of excellent wine, of which while thecompanions partook, a curtain, drawn across the entrance opening to thecourt, concealed them from view, but admonished them by the thinness ofthe partition to speak low, or to speak no secrets: they chose theformer alternative.\'Thou knowest,\' said Arbaces, in a voice that scarcely stirred the air,so soft and inward was its sound, \'that it has ever been my maxim toattach myself to the young.  From their flexile and unformed minds I cancarve out my fittest tools.  I weave--I warp--I mould them at my will.Of the men I make merely followers or servants; of the women...\'\'Mistresses,\' said Calenus, as a livid grin distorted his ungainlyfeatures.\'Yes, I do not disguise it: woman is the main object, the greatappetite, of my soul.  As you feed the victim for the slaughter, I loveto rear the votaries of my pleasure.  I love to train, to ripen theirminds--to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions, in order toprepare the fruit to my taste.  I loathe your ready-made and ripenedcourtesans; it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence todesire that I find the true charm of love; it is thus that I defysatiety; and by contemplating the freshness of others, I sustain thefreshness of my own sensations.  From the young hearts of my victims Idraw the ingredients of the caldron in which I re-youth myself.  Butenough of this: to the subject before us.  You know, then, that inNeapolis some time since I encountered Ione and Apaecides, brother andsister, the children of Athenians who had settled at Neapolis. The deathof their parents, who knew and esteemed me, constituted me theirguardian.  I was not unmindful of the trust. The youth, docile and mild,yielded readily to the impression I sought to stamp upon him.  Next towoman, I love the old recollections of my ancestral land; I love to keepalive--to propagate on distant shores (which her colonies perchance yetpeople) her dark and mystic creeds.  It may be, that it pleases me todelude mankind, while I thus serve the deities.  To Apaecides I taughtthe solemn faith of Isis.  I unfolded to him something of those sublimeallegories which are couched beneath her worship.  I excited in a soulpeculiarly alive to religious fervor that enthusiasm which imaginationbegets on faith.  I have placed him amongst you: he is one of you.\'\'He is so,\' said Calenus: \'but in thus stimulating his faith, you haverobbed him of wisdom.  He is horror-struck that he is no longer duped:our sage delusions, our speaking statues and secret staircases dismayand revolt him; he pines; he wastes away; he mutters to himself; herefuses to share our ceremonies.  He has been known to frequent thecompany of men suspected of adherence to that new and atheistical creedwhich denies all our gods, and terms our oracles the inspirations ofthat malevolent spirit of which eastern tradition speaks.  Ouroracles--alas! we know well whose inspirations they are!\'\'This is what I feared,\' said Arbaces, musingly, \'from variousreproaches he made me when I last saw him.  Of late he hath shunned mysteps.  I must find him: I must continue my lessons: I must lead himinto the adytum of Wisdom. I must teach him that there are two stages ofsanctity--the first, FAITH--the next, DELUSION; the one for the vulgar,the second for the sage.\'\'I never passed through the first, I said Calenus; \'nor you either, Ithink, my Arbaces.\'\'You err,\' replied the Egyptian, gravely.  \'I believe at this day (notindeed that which I teach, but that which I teach not).  Nature has asanctity against which I cannot (nor would I) steel conviction.  Ibelieve in mine own knowledge, and that has revealed to me--but nomatter.  Now to earthlier and more inviting themes.  If I thus fulfilledmy object with Apaecides, what was my design for Ione?  Thou knowestalready I intend her for my queen--my bride--my heart\'s Isis.  Nevertill I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable.\'\'I hear from a thousand lips that she is a second Helen,\' said Calenus;and he smacked his own lips, but whether at the wine or at the notion itis not easy to decide.\'Yes, she has a beauty that Greece itself never excelled,\' resumedArbaces. \'But that is not all: she has a soul worthy to match with mine.She has a genius beyond that of woman--keen--dazzling--bold. Poetryflows spontaneous to her lips: utter but a truth, and, however intricateand profound, her mind seizes and commands it.  Her imagination and herreason are not at war with each other; they harmonize and direct hercourse as the winds and the waves direct some lofty bark.  With this sheunites a daring independence of thought; she can stand alone in theworld; she can be brave as she is gentle; this is the nature I havesought all my life in woman, and never found till now.  Ione must bemine!  In her I have a double passion; I wish to enjoy a beauty ofspirit as of form.\'\'She is not yours yet, then?\' said the priest.\'No; she loves me--but as a friend--she loves me with her mind only.She fancies in me the paltry virtues which I have only the profoundervirtue to disdain.  But you must pursue with me her history. The brotherand sister were young and rich: Ione is proud and ambitious--proud ofher genius--the magic of her poetry--the charm of her conversation.When her brother left me, and entered your temple, in order to be nearhim she removed also to Pompeii.  She has suffered her talents to beknown.  She summons crowds to her feasts; her voice enchants them; herpoetry subdues.  She delights in being thought the successor of Erinna.\'\'Or of Sappho?\'\'But Sappho without love!  I encouraged her in this boldness ofcareer--in this indulgence of vanity and of pleasure.  I loved to steepher amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city.  Mark me,Calenus!  I desired to enervate her mind!--it has been too pure toreceive yet the breath which I wish not to pass, but burningly to eatinto, the mirror.  I wished her to be surrounded by lovers, hollow,vain, and frivolous (lovers that her nature must despise), in order tofeel the want of love.  Then, in those soft intervals of lassitudethat succeed to excitement--I can weave my spells--excite herinterest--attract her passions--possess myself of her heart.  For it isnot the young, nor the beautiful, nor the gay, that should fascinateIone; her imagination must be won, and the life of Arbaces has been onescene of triumph over the imaginations of his kind.\'\'And hast thou no fear, then, of thy rivals?  The gallants of Italy areskilled in the art to please.\'\'None!  Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans, and would scornitself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race.\'\'But thou art an Egyptian, not a Greek!\'\'Egypt,\' replied Arbaces, \'is the mother of Athens.  Her tutelaryMinerva is our deity; and her founder, Cecrops, was the fugitive ofEgyptian Sais. This have I already taught to her; and in my blood shevenerates the eldest dynasties of earth.  But yet I will own that oflate some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind.  She is more silentthan she used to be; she loves melancholy and subduing music; she sighswithout an outward cause.  This may be the beginning of love--it may bethe want of love.  In either case it is time for me to begin myoperations on her fancies and her heart: in the one case, to divert thesource of love to me; in the other, in me to awaken it. It is for thisthat I have sought you.\'\'And how can I assist you?\'\'I am about to invite her to a feast in my house: I wish to dazzle--tobewilder--to inflame her senses.  Our arts--the arts by which Egypttrained her young novitiates--must be employed; and, under veil of themysteries of religion, I will open to her the secrets of love.\'\'Ah! now I understand:--one of those voluptuous banquets that, despiteour dull vows of mortified coldness, we, the priests of Isis, haveshared at thy house.\'\'No, no!  Thinkest thou her chaste eyes are ripe for such scenes? No;but first we must ensnare the brother--an easier task.  Listen to me,while I give you my instructions.\'Chapter VMORE OF THE FLOWER-GIRL.  THE PROGRESS OF LOVE.THE sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber in the house of Glaucus,which I have before said is now called the \'Room of Leda\'.  The morningrays entered through rows of small casements at the higher part of theroom, and through the door which opened on the garden, that answered tothe inhabitants of the southern cities the same purpose that agreenhouse or conservatory does to us.  The size of the garden did notadapt it for exercise, but the various and fragrant plants with which itwas filled gave a luxury to that indolence so dear to the dwellers in asunny clime.  And now the odorous, fanned by a gentle wind creeping fromthe adjacent sea, scattered themselves over that chamber, whose wallsvied with the richest colors of the most glowing flowers.  Besides thegem of the room--the painting of Leda and Tyndarus--in the centre ofeach compartment of the walls were set other pictures of exquisitebeauty.  In one you saw Cupid leaning on the knees of Venus; in anotherAriadne sleeping on the beach, unconscious of the perfidy of Theseus.Merrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and thebrilliant walls--far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart ofthe young Glaucus.\'I have seen her, then,\' said he, as he paced that narrow chamber--\'Ihave heard her--nay, I have spoken to her again--I have listened to themusic of her song, and she sung of glory and of Greece.  I havediscovered the long-sought idol of my dreams; and like the Cypriansculptor, I have breathed life into my own imaginings.\'Longer, perhaps, had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus, but atthat moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a youngfemale, still half a child in years, broke upon his solitude.  She wasdressed simply in a white tunic, which reached from the neck to theankles; under her arm she bore a basket of flowers, and in the otherhand she held a bronze water-vase; her features were more formed thanexactly became her years, yet they were soft and feminine in theiroutline, and without being beautiful in themselves, they were almostmade so by their beauty of expression; there was something ineffablygentle, and you would say patient, in her aspect.  A look of resignedsorrow, of tranquil endurance, had banished the smile, but not thesweetness, from her lips; something timid and cautious in herstep--something wandering in her eyes, led you to suspect the afflictionwhich she had suffered from her birth--she was blind; but in the orbsthemselves there was no visible defect--their melancholy and subduedlight was clear, cloudless, and serene. \'They tell me that Glaucus ishere,\' said she; \'may I come in?\'\'Ah, my Nydia,\' said the Greek, \'is that you I knew you would notneglect my invitation.\'\'Glaucus did but justice to himself,\' answered Nydia, with a blush; \'forhe has always been kind to the poor blind girl.\'\'Who could be otherwise?\' said Glaucus, tenderly, and in the voice of acompassionate brother.Nydia sighed and paused before she resumed, without replying to hisremark. \'You have but lately returned?\'\'This is the sixth sun that hath shone upon me at Pompeii.\'\'And you are well?  Ah, I need not ask--for who that sees the earth,which they tell me is so beautiful, can be ill?\'\'I am well.  And you, Nydia--how you have grown!  Next year you will bethinking what answer to make your lovers.\'A second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia, but this time she frownedas she blushed.  \'I have brought you some flowers,\' said she, withoutreplying to a remark that she seemed to resent; and feeling about theroom till she found the table that stood by Glaucus, she laid the basketupon it: \'they are poor, but they are fresh-gathered.\'\'They might come from Flora herself,\' said he, kindly; \'and I renewagain my vow to the Graces, that I will wear no other garlands while thyhands can weave me such as these.\'\'And how find you the flowers in your viridarium?--are they thriving?\'\'Wonderfully so--the Lares themselves must have tended them.\'\'Ah, now you give me pleasure; for I came, as often as I could steal theleisure, to water and tend them in your absence.\'\'How shall I thank thee, fair Nydia?\' said the Greek.  \'Glaucus littledreamed that he left one memory so watchful over his favorites atPompeii.\'The hand of the child trembled, and her breast heaved beneath her tunic.She turned round in embarrassment.  \'The sun is hot for the poorflowers,\' said she, \'to-day and they will miss me; for I have been illlately, and it is nine days since I visited them.\'\'Ill, Nydia!--yet your cheek has more color than it had last year.\'\'I am often ailing,\' said the blind girl, touchingly; \'and as I grow upI grieve more that I am blind.  But now to the flowers!\' So saying, shemade a slight reverence with her head, and passing into the viridarium,busied herself with watering the flowers.\'Poor Nydia,\' thought Glaucus, gazing on her; \'thine is a hard doom!Thou seest not the earth--nor the sun--nor the ocean--nor thestars--above all, thou canst not behold Ione.\'At that last thought his mind flew back to the past evening, and was asecond time disturbed in its reveries by the entrance of Clodius.  Itwas a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and torefine the love of the Athenian for Ione, that whereas he had confidedto Clodius the secret of his first interview with her, and the effect ithad produced on him, he now felt an invincible aversion even to mentionto him her name.  He had seen Ione, bright, pure, unsullied, in themidst of the gayest and most profligate gallants of Pompeii, charmingrather than awing the boldest into respect, and changing the very natureof the most sensual and the least ideal--as by her intellectual andrefining spells she reversed the fable of Circe, and converted theanimals into men.  They who could not understand her soul were madespiritual, as it were, by the magic of her beauty--they who had no heartfor poetry had ears, at least, for the melody of her voice. Seeing herthus surrounded, purifying and brightening all things with her presence,Glaucus almost for the first time felt the nobleness of his ownnature--he felt how unworthy of the goddess of his dreams had been hiscompanions and his pursuits.  A veil seemed lifted from his eyes; he sawthat immeasurable distance between himself and his associates which thedeceiving mists of pleasure had hitherto concealed; he was refined by asense of his courage in aspiring to Ione.  He felt that henceforth itwas his destiny to look upward and to soar.  He could no longer breathethat name, which sounded to the sense of his ardent fancy as somethingsacred and divine, to lewd and vulgar ears.  She was no longer thebeautiful girl once seen and passionately remembered--she was alreadythe mistress, the divinity of his soul.  This feeling who has notexperienced?--If thou hast not, then thou hast never loved.When Clodius therefore spoke to him in affected transport of the beautyof Ione, Glaucus felt only resentment and disgust that such lips shoulddare to praise her; he answered coldly, and the Roman imagined that hispassion was cured instead of heightened.  Clodius scarcely regretted it,for he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richlyendowed--Julia, the daughter of the wealthy Diomed, whose gold thegamester imagined he could readily divert into his own coffers.  Theirconversation did not flow with its usual ease; and no sooner had Clodiusleft him than Glaucus bent his way to the house of Ione.  In passing bythe threshold he again encountered Nydia, who had finished her gracefultask.  She knew his step on the instant.\'You are early abroad?\' said she.\'Yes; for the skies of Campania rebuke the sluggard who neglects them.\'\'Ah, would I could see them!\' murmured the blind girl, but so low thatGlaucus did not overhear the complaint.The Thessalian lingered on the threshold a few moments, and then guidingher steps by a long staff, which she used with great dexterity, she tookher way homeward.  She soon turned from the more gaudy streets, andentered a quarter of the town but little loved by the decorous and thesober.  But from the low and rude evidences of vice around her she wassaved by her misfortune.  And at that hour the streets were quiet andsilent, nor was her youthful ear shocked by the sounds which too oftenbroke along the obscene and obscure haunts she patiently and sadlytraversed.She knocked at the back-door of a sort of tavern; it opened, and a rudevoice bade her give an account of the sesterces.  Ere she could reply,another voice, less vulgarly accented, said:\'Never mind those petty profits, my Burbo.  The girl\'s voice will bewanted again soon at our rich friend\'s revels; and he pays, as thouknowest, pretty high for his nightingales\' tongues.\'Oh, I hope not--I trust not,\' cried Nydia, trembling.  \'I will beg fromsunrise to sunset, but send me not there.\'\'And why?\' asked the same voice.\'Because--because I am young, and delicately born, and the femalecompanions I meet there are not fit associates for one who--who...\'\'Is a slave in the house of Burbo,\' returned the voice ironically, andwith a coarse laugh.The Thessalian put down the flowers, and, leaning her face on her hands,wept silently.Meanwhile, Glaucus sought the house of the beautiful Neapolitan. Hefound Ione sitting amidst her attendants, who were at work around her.Her harp stood at her side, for Ione herself was unusually idle, perhapsunusually thoughtful, that day.  He thought her even more beautiful bythe morning light and in her simple robe, than amidst the blazing lamps,and decorated with the costly jewels of the previous night: not the lessso from a certain paleness that overspread her transparent hues--not theless so from the blush that mounted over them when he approached.Accustomed to flatter, flattery died upon his lips when he addressedIone.  He felt it beneath her to utter the homage which every lookconveyed.  They spoke of Greece; this was a theme on which Ione lovedrather to listen than to converse: it was a theme on which the Greekcould have been eloquent for ever.  He described to her the silver olivegroves that yet clad the banks of Ilyssus, and the temples, alreadydespoiled of half their glories--but how beautiful in decay!  He lookedback on the melancholy city of Harmodius the free, and Pericles themagnificent, from the height of that distant memory, which mellowed intoone hazy light all the ruder and darker shades.  He had seen the land ofpoetry chiefly in the poetical age of early youth; and the associationsof patriotism were blended with those of the flush and spring of life.And Ione listened to him, absorbed and mute; dearer were those accents,and those descriptions, than all the prodigal adulation of hernumberless adorers.  Was it a sin to love her countryman? she lovedAthens in him--the gods of her race, the land of her dreams, spoke toher in his voice!  From that time they daily saw each other.  At thecool of the evening they made excursions on the placid sea.  By nightthey met again in Ione\'s porticoes and halls.  Their love was sudden,but it was strong; it filled all the sources of their life.Heart--brain--sense--imagination, all were its ministers and priests.As you take some obstacle from two objects that have a mutualattraction, they met, and united at once; their wonder was, that theyhad lived separate so long.  And it was natural that they should solove.  Young, beautiful, and gifted--of the same birth, and the samesoul--there was poetry in their very union.  They imagined the heavenssmiled upon their affection.  As the persecuted seek refuge at theshrine, so they recognized in the altar of their love an asylum from thesorrows of earth; they covered it with flowers--they knew not of theserpents that lay coiled behind.One evening, the fifth after their first meeting at Pompeii, Glaucus andIone, with a small party of chosen friends, were returning from anexcursion round the bay; their vessel skimmed lightly over the twilightwaters, whose lucid mirror was only broken by the dripping oars.  As therest of the party conversed gaily with each other, Glaucus lay at thefeet of Ione, and he would have looked up in her face, but he did notdare.  Ione broke the pause between them.\'My poor brother,\' said she, sighing, \'how once he would have enjoyedthis hour!\'\'Your brother!\' said Glaucus; \'I have not seen him.  Occupied with you,I have thought of nothing else, or I should have asked if that was notyour brother for whose companionship you left me at the Temple ofMinerva, in Neapolis?\'\'It was.\'\'And is he here?\'\'He is.\'At Pompeii! and not constantly with you?  Impossible!\'\'He has other duties,\' answered Ione, sadly; \'he is a priest of Isis.\'\'So young, too; and that priesthood, in its laws at least, so severe!\'said the warm and bright-hearted Greek, in surprise and pity. \'Whatcould have been his inducement?\'\'He was always enthusiastic and fervent in religious devotion: and theeloquence of an Egyptian--our friend and guardian--kindled in him thepious desire to consecrate his life to the most mystic of our deities.Perhaps in the intenseness of his zeal, he found in the severity of thatpeculiar priesthood its peculiar attraction.\'\'And he does not repent his choice?--I trust he is happy.\'Ione sighed deeply, and lowered her veil over her eyes.\'I wish,\' said she, after a pause, \'that he had not been so hasty.Perhaps, like all who expect too much, he is revolted too easily!\'\'Then he is not happy in his new condition.  And this Egyptian, was he apriest himself? was he interested in recruits to the sacred band?\'No.  His main interest was in our happiness.  He thought he promotedthat of my brother.  We were left orphans.\'\'Like myself,\' said Glaucus, with a deep meaning in his voice.Ione cast down her eyes as she resumed:\'And Arbaces sought to supply the place of our parent.  You must knowhim. He loves genius.\'\'Arbaces! I know him already; at least, we speak when we meet.  But foryour praise I would not seek to know more of him.  My heart inclinesreadily to most of my kind.  But that dark Egyptian, with his gloomybrow and icy smiles, seems to me to sadden the very sun. One would thinkthat, like Epimenides, the Cretan, he had spent forty years in a cave,and had found something unnatural in the daylight ever afterwards.\'\'Yet, like Epimenides, he is kind, and wise, and gentle,\' answered Ione.\'Oh, happy that he has thy praise!  He needs no other virtues to makehim dear to me.\'\'His calm, his coldness,\' said Ione, evasively pursuing the subject,\'are perhaps but the exhaustion of past sufferings; as yonder mountain(and she pointed to Vesuvius), which we see dark and tranquil in thedistance, once nursed the fires for ever quenched.\'They both gazed on the mountain as Ione said these words; the rest ofthe sky was bathed in rosy and tender hues, but over that grey summit,rising amidst the woods and vineyards that then clomb half-way up theascent, there hung a black and ominous cloud, the single frown of thelandscape.  A sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each as they thusgazed; and in that sympathy which love had already taught them, andwhich bade them, in the slightest shadows of emotion, the faintestpresentiment of evil, turn for refuge to each other, their gaze at thesame moment left the mountain, and full of unimaginable tenderness, met.What need had they of words to say they loved?Chapter VITHE FOWLER SNARES AGAIN THE BIRD THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED, AND SETS HISNETS FOR A NEW VICTIM.IN the history I relate, the events are crowded and rapid as those ofthe drama.  I write of an epoch in which days sufficed to ripen theordinary fruits of years.Meanwhile, Arbaces had not of late much frequented the house of Ione;and when he had visited her he had not encountered Glaucus, nor knew he,as yet, of that love which had so suddenly sprung up between himself andhis designs.  In his interest for the brother of Ione, he had beenforced, too, a little while, to suspend his interest in Ione herself.His pride and his selfishness were aroused and alarmed at the suddenchange which had come over the spirit of the youth.  He trembled lest hehimself should lose a docile pupil, and Isis an enthusiastic servant.Apaecides had ceased to seek or to consult him.  He was rarely to befound; he turned sullenly from the Egyptian--nay, he fled when heperceived him in the distance. Arbaces was one of those haughty andpowerful spirits accustomed to master others; he chafed at the notionthat one once his own should ever elude his grasp. He swore inly thatApaecides should not escape him.It was with this resolution that he passed through a thick grove in thecity, which lay between his house and that of Ione, in his way to thelatter; and there, leaning against a tree, and gazing on the ground, hecame unawares on the young priest of Isis.\'Apaecides!\' said he--and he laid his hand affectionately on the youngman\'s shoulder.The priest started; and his first instinct seemed to be that of flight.\'My son,\' said the Egyptian, \'what has chanced that you desire to shunme?\'Apaecides remained silent and sullen, looking down on the earth, as hislips quivered, and his breast heaved with emotion.\'Speak to me, my friend,\' continued the Egyptian.  \'Speak. Somethingburdens thy spirit.  What hast thou to reveal?\'\'To thee--nothing.\'\'And why is it to me thou art thus unconfidential?\'\'Because thou hast been my enemy.\'\'Let us confer,\' said Arbaces, in a low voice; and drawing the reluctantarm of the priest in his own, he led him to one of the seats which werescattered within the grove.  They sat down--and in those gloomy formsthere was something congenial to the shade and solitude of the place.Apaecides was in the spring of his years, yet he seemed to haveexhausted even more of life than the Egyptian; his delicate and regularfeatures were worn and colorless; his eyes were hollow, and shone with abrilliant and feverish glare: his frame bowed prematurely, and in hishands, which were small to effeminacy, the blue and swollen veinsindicated the lassitude and weakness of the relaxed fibres.  You saw inhis face a strong resemblance to Ione, but the expression was altogetherdifferent from that majestic and spiritual calm which breathed so divineand classical a repose over his sister\'s beauty.  In her, enthusiasm wasvisible, but it seemed always suppressed and restrained; this made thecharm and sentiment of her countenance; you longed to awaken a spiritwhich reposed, but evidently did not sleep.  In Apaecides the wholeaspect betokened the fervor and passion of his temperament, and theintellectual portion of his nature seemed, by the wild fire of the eyes,the great breadth of the temples when compared with the height of thebrow, the trembling restlessness of the lips, to be swayed andtyrannized over by the imaginative and ideal.  Fancy, with the sister,had stopped short at the golden goal of poetry; with the brother, lesshappy and less restrained, it had wandered into visions more intangibleand unembodied; and the faculties which gave genius to the onethreatened madness to the other.\'You say I have been your enemy,\' said Arbaces, \'I know the cause ofthat unjust accusation: I have placed you amidst the priests ofIsis--you are revolted at their trickeries and imposture--you think thatI too have deceived you--the purity of your mind is offended--youimagine that I am one of the deceitful...\'\'You knew the jugglings of that impious craft,\' answered Apaecides; \'whydid you disguise them from me?--When you excited my desire to devotemyself to the office whose garb I bear, you spoke to me of the holy lifeof men resigning themselves to knowledge--you have given me forcompanions an ignorant and sensual herd, who have no knowledge but thatof the grossest frauds; you spoke to me of men sacrificing the earthlierpleasures to the sublime cultivation of virtue--you place me amongst menreeking with all the filthiness of vice; you spoke to me of the friends,the enlighteners of our common kind--I see but their cheats anddeluders!  Oh!  it was basely done!--you have robbed me of the glory ofyouth, of the convictions of virtue, of the sanctifying thirst afterwisdom.  Young as I was, rich, fervent, the sunny pleasures of earthbefore me, I resigned all without a sign, nay, with happiness andexultation, in the thought that I resigned them for the abstrusemysteries of diviner wisdom, for the companionship of gods--for therevelations of Heaven--and now--now...\'Convulsive sobs checked the priest\'s voice; he covered his face with hishands, and large tears forced themselves through the wasted fingers, andran profusely down his vest.\'What I promised to thee, that will I give, my friend, my pupil: thesehave been but trials to thy virtue--it comes forth the brighter for thynovitiate--think no more of those dull cheats--assort no more with thosemenials of the goddess, the atrienses of her hall--you are worthy toenter into the penetralia.  I henceforth will be your priest, yourguide, and you who now curse my friendship shall live to bless it.\'The young man lifted up his head, and gazed with a vacant and wonderingstare upon the Egyptian.\'Listen to me,\' continued Arbaces, in an earnest and solemn voice,casting first his searching eyes around to see that they were stillalone.  \'From Egypt came all the knowledge of the world; from Egypt camethe lore of Athens, and the profound policy of Crete; from Egypt camethose early and mysterious tribes which (long before the hordes ofRomulus swept over the plains of Italy, and in the eternal cycle ofevents drove back civilization into barbarism and darkness) possessedall the arts of wisdom and the graces of intellectual life.  From Egyptcame the rites and the grandeur of that solemn Caere, whose inhabitantstaught their iron vanquishers of Rome all that they yet know of elevatedin religion and sublime in worship.  And how deemest thou, young man,that that Egypt, the mother of countless nations, achieved hergreatness, and soared to her cloud-capt eminence of wisdom?--It was theresult of a profound and holy policy.  Your modern nations owe theirgreatness to Egypt--Egypt her greatness to her priests.  Rapt inthemselves, coveting a sway over the nobler part of man, his soul andhis belief, those ancient ministers of God were inspired with thegrandest thought that ever exalted mortals.  From the revolutions of thestars, from the seasons of the earth, from the round and unvaryingcircle of human destinies, they devised an august allegory; they made itgross and palpable to the vulgar by the signs of gods and goddesses, andthat which in reality was Government they named Religion.  Isis is afable--start not!--that for which Isis is a type is a reality, animmortal being; Isis is nothing.  Nature, which she represents, is themother of all things--dark, ancient, inscrutable, save to the giftedfew.  ""None among mortals hath ever lifted up my veil,"" so saith theIsis that you adore; but to the wise that veil hath been removed, and wehave stood face to face with the solemn loveliness of Nature.  Thepriests then were the benefactors, the civilizers of mankind; true, theywere also cheats, impostors if you will.  But think you, young man, thatif they had not deceived their kind they could have served them?  Theignorant and servile vulgar must be blinded to attain to their propergood; they would not believe a maxim--they revere an oracle.  TheEmperor of Rome sways the vast and various tribes of earth, andharmonizes the conflicting and disunited elements; thence come peace,order, law, the blessings of life. Think you it is the man, the emperor,that thus sways?--no, it is the pomp, the awe, the majesty that surroundhim--these are his impostures, his delusions; our oracles and ourdivinations, our rites and our ceremonies, are the means of oursovereignty and the engines of our power.  They are the same means tothe same end, the welfare and harmony of mankind.  You listen to me raptand intent--the light begins to dawn upon you.\'Apaecides remained silent, but the changes rapidly passing over hisspeaking countenance betrayed the effect produced upon him by the wordsof the Egyptian--words made tenfold more eloquent by the voice, theaspect, and the manner of the man.\'While, then,\' resumed Arbaces, \'our fathers of the Nile thus achievedthe first elements by whose life chaos is destroyed, namely, theobedience and reverence of the multitude for the few, they drew fromtheir majestic and starred meditations that wisdom which was nodelusion: they invented the codes and regularities of law--the arts andglories of existence.  They asked belief; they returned the gift bycivilization.  Were not their very cheats a virtue!  Trust me, whosoeverin yon far heavens of a diviner and more beneficent nature look downupon our world, smile approvingly on the wisdom which has worked suchends.  But you wish me to apply these generalities to yourself; I hastento obey the wish.  The altars of the goddess of our ancient faith mustbe served, and served too by others than the stolid and soulless thingsthat are but as pegs and hooks whereon to hang the fillet and the robe.Remember two sayings of Sextus the Pythagorean, sayings borrowed fromthe lore of Egypt.  The first is, ""Speak not of God to the multitude"";the second is, ""The man worthy of God is a god among men."" As Geniusgave to the ministers of Egypt worship, that empire in late ages sofearfully decayed, thus by Genius only can the dominion be restored.  Isaw in you, Apaecides, a pupil worthy of my lessons--a minister worthyof the great ends which may yet be wrought; your energy, your talents,your purity of faith, your earnestness of enthusiasm, all fitted you forthat calling which demands so imperiously high and ardent qualities: Ifanned, therefore, your sacred desires; I stimulated you to the step youhave taken. But you blame me that I did not reveal to you the littlesouls and the juggling tricks of your companions.  Had I done so,Apaecides, I had defeated my own object; your noble nature would have atonce revolted, and Isis would have lost her priest.\'Apaecides groaned aloud.  The Egyptian continued, without heeding theinterruption.\'I placed you, therefore, without preparation, in the temple; I left yousuddenly to discover and to be sickened by all those mummeries whichdazzle the herd.  I desired that you should perceive how those enginesare moved by which the fountain that refreshes the world casts itswaters in the air.  It was the trial ordained of old to all our priests.They who accustom themselves to the impostures of the vulgar, are leftto practise them--for those like you, whose higher natures demand higherpursuit, religion opens more god-like secrets.  I am pleased to find inyou the character I had expected.  You have taken the vows; you cannotrecede.  Advance--I will be your guide.\'\'And what wilt thou teach me, O singular and fearful man?  Newcheats--new...\'\'No--I have thrown thee into the abyss of disbelief; I will lead theenow to the eminence of faith.  Thou hast seen the false types: thoushalt learn now the realities they represent.  There is no shadow,Apaecides, without its substance.  Come to me this night.  Your hand.\'Impressed, excited, bewildered by the language of the Egyptian,Apaecides gave him his hand, and master and pupil parted.It was true that for Apaecides there was no retreat.  He had taken thevows of celibacy: he had devoted himself to a life that at presentseemed to possess all the austerities of fanaticism, without any of theconsolations of belief It was natural that he should yet cling to ayearning desire to reconcile himself to an irrevocable career.  Thepowerful and profound mind of the Egyptian yet claimed an empire overhis young imagination; excited him with vague conjecture, and kept himalternately vibrating between hope and fear.Meanwhile Arbaces pursued his slow and stately way to the house of Ione.As he entered the tablinum, he heard a voice from the porticoes of theperistyle beyond, which, musical as it was, sounded displeasingly on hisear--it was the voice of the young and beautiful Glaucus, and for thefirst time an involuntary thrill of jealousy shot through the breast ofthe Egyptian.  On entering the peristyle, he found Glaucus seated by theside of Ione.  The fountain in the odorous garden cast up its silverspray in the air, and kept a delicious coolness in the midst of thesultry noon.  The handmaids, almost invariably attendant on Ione, whowith her freedom of life preserved the most delicate modesty, sat at alittle distance; by the feet of Glaucus lay the lyre on which he hadbeen playing to Ione one of the Lesbian airs.  The scene--the groupbefore Arbaces, was stamped by that peculiar and refined ideality ofpoesy which we yet, not erroneously, imagine to be the distinction ofthe ancients--the marble columns, the vases of flowers, the statue,white and tranquil, closing every vista; and, above all, the two livingforms, from which a sculptor might have caught either inspiration ordespair!Arbaces, pausing for a moment, gazed on the pair with a brow from whichall the usual stern serenity had fled; he recovered himself by aneffort, and slowly approached them, but with a step so soft andecholess, that even the attendants heard him not; much less Ione and herlover.\'And yet,\' said Glaucus, \'it is only before we love that we imagine thatour poets have truly described the passion; the instant the sun rises,all the stars that had shone in his absence vanish into air.  The poetsexist only in the night of the heart; they are nothing to us when wefeel the full glory of the god.\'\'A gentle and most glowing image, noble Glaucus.\'Both started, and recognized behind the seat of Ione the cold andsarcastic face of the Egyptian.\'You are a sudden guest,\' said Glaucus, rising, and with a forced smile.\'So ought all to be who know they are welcome,\' returned Arbaces,seating himself, and motioning to Glaucus to do the same.\'I am glad,\' said Ione, \'to see you at length together; for you aresuited to each other, and you are formed to be friends.\'\'Give me back some fifteen years of life,\' replied the Egyptian, \'beforeyou can place me on an equality with Glaucus.  Happy should I be toreceive his friendship; but what can I give him in return?  Can I maketo him the same confidences that he would repose in me--of banquets andgarlands--of Parthian steeds, and the chances of the dice? thesepleasures suit his age, his nature, his career: they are not for mine.\'So saying, the artful Egyptian looked down and sighed; but from thecorner of his eye he stole a glance towards Ione, to see how shereceived these insinuations of the pursuits of her visitor.  Hercountenance did not satisfy him.  Glaucus, slightly coloring, hastenedgaily to reply.  Nor was he, perhaps, without the wish in his turn todisconcert and abash the Egyptian.\'You are right, wise Arbaces,\' said he; \'we can esteem each other, butwe cannot be friends.  My banquets lack the secret salt which, accordingto rumor, gives such zest to your own.  And, by Hercules! when I havereached your age, if I, like you, may think it wise to pursue thepleasures of manhood, like you, I shall be doubtless sarcastic on thegallantries of youth.\'The Egyptian raised his eyes to Glaucus with a sudden and piercingglance.\'I do not understand you,\' said he, coldly; \'but it is the custom toconsider that wit lies in obscurity.\' He turned from Glaucus as hespoke, with a scarcely perceptible sneer of contempt, and after amoment\'s pause addressed himself to Ione.\'I have not, beautiful Ione,\' said he, \'been fortunate enough to findyou within doors the last two or three times that I have visited yourvestibule.\'\'The smoothness of the sea has tempted me much from home,\' replied Ione,with a little embarrassment.The embarrassment did not escape Arbaces; but without seeming to heedit, he replied with a smile: \'You know the old poet says, that ""Womenshould keep within doors, and there converse.""\'\'The poet was a cynic,\' said Glaucus, \'and hated women.\'\'He spoke according to the customs of his country, and that country isyour boasted Greece.\'\'To different periods different customs.  Had our forefathers knownIone, they had made a different law.\'\'Did you learn these pretty gallantries at Rome?\' said Arbaces, withill-suppressed emotion.\'One certainly would not go for gallantries to Egypt,\' retorted Glaucus,playing carelessly with his chain.\'Come, come,\' said Ione, hastening to interrupt a conversation which shesaw, to her great distress, was so little likely to cement the intimacyshe had desired to effect between Glaucus and her friend, \'Arbaces mustnot be so hard upon his poor pupil.  An orphan, and without a mother\'scare, I may be to blame for the independent and almost masculine libertyof life that I have chosen: yet it is not greater than the Roman womenare accustomed to--it is not greater than the Grecian ought to be.Alas! is it only to be among men that freedom and virtue are to bedeemed united?  Why should the slavery that destroys you be consideredthe only method to preserve us?  Ah! believe me, it has been the greaterror of men--and one that has worked bitterly on their destinies--toimagine that the nature of women is (I will not say inferior, that maybe so, but) so different from their own, in making laws unfavorable tothe intellectual advancement of women.  Have they not, in so doing, madelaws against their children, whom women are to rear?--against thehusbands, of whom women are to be the friends, nay, sometimes theadvisers?\' Ione stopped short suddenly, and her face was suffused withthe most enchanting blushes.  She feared lest her enthusiasm had led hertoo far; yet she feared the austere Arbaces less than the courteousGlaucus, for she loved the last, and it was not the custom of the Greeksto allow their women (at least such of their women as they most honored)the same liberty and the same station as those of Italy enjoyed. Shefelt, therefore, a thrill of delight as Glaucus earnestly replied:\'Ever mayst thou think thus, Ione--ever be your pure heart your unerringguide!  Happy it had been for Greece if she had given to the chaste thesame intellectual charms that are so celebrated amongst the less worthyof her women.  No state falls from freedom--from knowledge, while yoursex smile only on the free, and by appreciating, encourage the wise.\'Arbaces was silent, for it was neither his part to sanction thesentiment of Glaucus, nor to condemn that of Ione, and, after a shortand embarrassed conversation, Glaucus took his leave of Ione.When he was gone, Arbaces, drawing his seat nearer to the fairNeapolitan\'s, said in those bland and subdued tones, in which he knew sowell how to veil the mingled art and fierceness of his character:\'Think not, my sweet pupil, if so I may call you, that I wish to shacklethat liberty you adorn while you assume: but which, if not greater, asyou rightly observe, than that possessed by the Roman women, must atleast be accompanied by great circumspection, when arrogated by oneunmarried. Continue to draw crowds of the gay, the brilliant, the wisethemselves, to your feet--continue to charm them with the conversationof an Aspasia, the music of an Erinna--but reflect, at least, on thosecensorious tongues which can so easily blight the tender reputation of amaiden; and while you provoke admiration, give, I beseech you, novictory to envy.\'\'What mean you, Arbaces?\' said Ione, in an alarmed and trembling voice:\'I know you are my friend, that you desire only my honour and mywelfare.  What is it you would say?\'\'Your friend--ah, how sincerely!  May I speak then as a friend, withoutreserve and without offence?\'\'I beseech you do so.\'\'This young profligate, this Glaucus, how didst thou know him? Hast thouseen him often?\' And as Arbaces spoke, he fixed his gaze steadfastlyupon Ione, as if he sought to penetrate into her soul.Recoiling before that gaze, with a strange fear which she could notexplain, the Neapolitan answered with confusion and hesitation: \'He wasbrought to my house as a countryman of my father\'s, and I may say ofmine.  I have known him only within this last week or so: but why thesequestions?\'\'Forgive me,\' said Arbaces; \'I thought you might have known him longer.Base insinuator that he is!\'\'How! what mean you?  Why that term?\'\'It matters not: let me not rouse your indignation against one who doesnot deserve so grave an honour.\'\'I implore you speak.  What has Glaucus insinuated? or rather, in whatdo you suppose he has offended?\'Smothering his resentment at the last part of Ione\'s question, Arbacescontinued: \'You know his pursuits, his companions his habits; thecomissatio and the alea (the revel and the dice) make his occupation;and amongst the associates of vice how can he dream of virtue?\'\'Still you speak riddles.  By the gods!  I entreat you, say the worst atonce.\'\'Well, then, it must be so.  Know, my Ione, that it was but yesterdaythat Glaucus boasted openly--yes, in the public baths--of your love tohim.  He said it amused him to take advantage of it. Nay, I will do himjustice, he praised your beauty.  Who could deny it? But he laughedscornfully when his Clodius, or his Lepidus, asked him if he loved youenough for marriage, and when he purposed to adorn his door-posts withflowers?\'\'Impossible!  How heard you this base slander?\'\'Nay, would you have me relate to you all the comments of the insolentcoxcombs with which the story has circled through the town? Be assuredthat I myself disbelieved at first, and that I have now painfully beenconvinced by several ear-witnesses of the truth of what I havereluctantly told thee.\'Ione sank back, and her face was whiter than the pillar against whichshe leaned for support.\'I own it vexed--it irritated me, to hear your name thus lightly pitchedfrom lip to lip, like some mere dancing-girl\'s fame.  I hastened thismorning to seek and to warn you.  I found Glaucus here.  I was stungfrom my self-possession.  I could not conceal my feelings; nay, I wasuncourteous in thy presence.  Canst thou forgive thy friend, Ione?\'Ione placed her hand in his, but replied not.\'Think no more of this,\' said he; \'but let it be a warning voice, totell thee how much prudence thy lot requires.  It cannot hurt thee,Ione, for a moment; for a gay thing like this could never have beenhonored by even a serious thought from Ione.  These insults only woundwhen they come from one we love; far different indeed is he whom thelofty Ione shall stoop to love.\'\'Love!\' muttered Ione, with an hysterical laugh.  \'Ay, indeed.\'It is not without interest to observe in those remote times, and under asocial system so widely different from the modern, the same small causesthat ruffle and interrupt the \'course of love\', which operate socommonly at this day--the same inventive jealousy, the same cunningslander, the same crafty and fabricated retailings of petty gossip,which so often now suffice to break the ties of the truest love, andcounteract the tenor of circumstances most apparently propitious.  Whenthe bark sails on over the smoothest wave, the fable tells us of thediminutive fish that can cling to the keel and arrest its progress: sois it ever with the great passions of mankind; and we should paint lifebut ill if, even in times the most prodigal of romance, and of theromance of which we most largely avail ourselves, we did not alsodescribe the mechanism of those trivial and household springs ofmischief which we see every day at work in our chambers and at ourhearths.  It is in these, the lesser intrigues of life, that we mostlyfind ourselves at home with the past.Most cunningly had the Egyptian appealed to Ione\'s ruling foible--mostdexterously had he applied the poisoned dart to her pride.  He fanciedhe had arrested what he hoped, from the shortness of the time she hadknown Glaucus, was, at most, but an incipient fancy; and hastening tochange the subject, he now led her to talk of her brother.  Theirconversation did not last long.  He left her, resolved not again totrust so much to absence, but to visit--to watch her--every day.No sooner had his shadow glided from her presence, than woman\'spride--her sex\'s dissimulation--deserted his intended victim, and thehaughty Ione burst into passionate tears.Chapter VIITHE GAY LIFE OF THE POMPEIAN LOUNGER.  A MINIATURE LIKENESS OF THE ROMANBATHS.WHEN Glaucus left Ione, he felt as if he trod upon air.  In theinterview with which he had just been blessed, he had for the first timegathered from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome to, andwould not be unrewarded by, her.  This hope filled him with a rapturefor which earth and heaven seemed too narrow to afford a vent.Unconscious of the sudden enemy he had left behind, and forgetting notonly his taunts but his very existence, Glaucus passed through the gaystreets, repeating to himself, in the wantonness of joy, the music ofthe soft air to which Ione had listened with such intentness; and now heentered the Street of Fortune, with its raised footpath--its housespainted without, and the open doors admitting the view of the glowingfrescoes within.  Each end of the street was adorned with a triumphalarch: and as Glaucus now came before the Temple of Fortune, the juttingportico of that beautiful fane (which is supposed to have been built byone of the family of Cicero, perhaps by the orator himself) imparted adignified and venerable feature to a scene otherwise more brilliant thanlofty in its character.  That temple was one of the most gracefulspecimens of Roman architecture. It was raised on a somewhat loftypodium; and between two flights of steps ascending to a platform stoodthe altar of the goddess.  From this platform another flight of broadstairs led to the portico, from the height of whose fluted columns hungfestoons of the richest flowers.  On either side the extremities of thetemple were placed statues of Grecian workmanship; and at a littledistance from the temple rose the triumphal arch crowned with anequestrian statue of Caligula, which was flanked by trophies of bronze.In the space before the temple a lively throng were assembled--someseated on benches and discussing the politics of the empire, someconversing on the approaching spectacle of the amphitheatre.  One knotof young men were lauding a new beauty, another discussing the merits ofthe last play; a third group, more stricken in age, were speculating onthe chance of the trade with Alexandria, and amidst these were manymerchants in the Eastern costume, whose loose and peculiar robes,painted and gemmed slippers, and composed and serious countenances,formed a striking contrast to the tunicked forms and animated gesturesof the Italians.  For that impatient and lively people had, as now, alanguage distinct from speech--a language of signs and motions,inexpressibly significant and vivacious: their descendants retain it,and the learned Jorio hath written a most entertaining work upon thatspecies of hieroglyphical gesticulation.Sauntering through the crowd, Glaucus soon found himself amidst a groupof his merry and dissipated friends.\'Ah!\' said Sallust, \'it is a lustrum since I saw you.\'\'And how have you spent the lustrum?  What new dishes have youdiscovered?\'\'I have been scientific,\' returned Sallust, \'and have made someexperiments in the feeding of lampreys: I confess I despair of bringingthem to the perfection which our Roman ancestors attained.\'\'Miserable man! and why?\'\'Because,\' returned Sallust, with a sigh, \'it is no longer lawful togive them a slave to eat.  I am very often tempted to make away with avery fat carptor (butler) whom I possess, and pop him slily into thereservoir.  He would give the fish a most oleaginous flavor!  But slavesare not slaves nowadays, and have no sympathy with their masters\'interest--or Davus would destroy himself to oblige me!\'\'What news from Rome?\' said Lepidus, as he languidly joined the group.\'The emperor has been giving a splendid supper to the senators,\'answered Sallust.\'He is a good creature,\' quoth Lepidus; \'they say he never sends a manaway without granting his request.\'\'Perhaps he would let me kill a slave for my reservoir?\' returnedSallust, eagerly.\'Not unlikely,\' said Glaucus; \'for he who grants a favor to one Roman,must always do it at the expense of another.  Be sure, that for everysmile Titus has caused, a hundred eyes have wept.\'\'Long live Titus!\' cried Pansa, overhearing the emperor\'s name, as heswept patronizingly through the crowd; \'he has promised my brother aquaestorship, because he had run through his fortune.\'\'And wishes now to enrich himself among the people, my Pansa,\' saidGlaucus.\'Exactly so,\' said Pansa.\'That is putting the people to some use,\' said Glaucus.\'To be sure, returned Pansa.  \'Well, I must go and look after theaerarium--it is a little out of repair\'; and followed by a long train ofclients, distinguished from the rest of the throng by the togas theywore (for togas, once the sign of freedom in a citizen, were now thebadge of servility to a patron), the aedile fidgeted fussily away.\'Poor Pansa!\' said Lepidus: \'he never has time for pleasure.  ThankHeaven I am not an aedile!\'\'Ah, Glaucus! how are you? gay as ever?\' said Clodius, joining thegroup.\'Are you come to sacrifice to Fortune?\' said Sallust.\'I sacrifice to her every night,\' returned the gamester.\'I do not doubt it.  No man has made more victims!\'\'By Hercules, a biting speech!\' cried Glaucus, laughing.\'The dog\'s letter is never out of your mouth, Sallust,\' said Clodius,angrily: \'you are always snarling.\'\'I may well have the dog\'s letter in my mouth, since, whenever I playwith you, I have the dog\'s throw in my hand,\' returned Sallust.\'Hist!\' said Glaucus, taking a rose from a flower-girl, who stoodbeside.\'The rose is the token of silence,\' replied Sallust, \'but I love only tosee it at the supper-table.\'\'Talking of that, Diomed gives a grand feast next week,\' said Sallust:\'are you invited, Glaucus?\'\'Yes, I received an invitation this morning.\'\'And I, too,\' said Sallust, drawing a square piece of papyrus from hisgirdle: \'I see that he asks us an hour earlier than usual: an earnest ofsomething sumptuous.\'\'Oh! he is rich as Croesus,\' said Clodius; \'and his bill of fare is aslong as an epic.\'\'Well, let us to the baths,\' said Glaucus: \'this is the time when allthe world is there; and Fulvius, whom you admire so much, is going toread us his last ode.\'The young men assented readily to the proposal, and they strolled to thebaths.Although the public thermae, or baths, were instituted rather for thepoorer citizens than the wealthy (for the last had baths in their ownhouses), yet, to the crowds of all ranks who resorted to them, it was afavorite place for conversation, and for that indolent lounging so dearto a gay and thoughtless people.  The baths at Pompeii differed, ofcourse, in plan and construction from the vast and complicated thermaeof Rome; and, indeed, it seems that in each city of the empire there wasalways some slight modification of arrangement in the generalarchitecture of the public baths. This mightily puzzles the learned--asif architects and fashion were not capricious before the nineteenthcentury!  Our party entered by the principal porch in the Street ofFortune.  At the wing of the portico sat the keeper of the baths, withhis two boxes before him, one for the money he received, one for thetickets he dispensed.  Round the walls of the portico were seats crowdedwith persons of all ranks; while others, as the regimen of thephysicians prescribed, were walking briskly to and fro the portico,stopping every now and then to gaze on the innumerable notices of shows,games, sales, exhibitions, which were painted or inscribed upon thewalls. The general subject of conversation was, however, the spectacleannounced in the amphitheatre; and each new-comer was fastened upon by agroup eager to know if Pompeii had been so fortunate as to produce somemonstrous criminal, some happy case of sacrilege or of murder, whichwould allow the aediles to provide a man for the jaws of the lion: allother more common exhibitions seemed dull and tame, when compared withthe possibility of this fortunate occurrence.\'For my part,\' said one jolly-looking man, who was a goldsmith, \'I thinkthe emperor, if he is as good as they say, might have sent us a Jew.\'\'Why not take one of the new sect of Nazarenes?\' said a philosopher.  \'Iam not cruel: but an atheist, one who denies Jupiter himself, deservesno mercy.\'\'I care not how many gods a man likes to believe in,\' said thegoldsmith; \'but to deny all gods is something monstrous.\'\'Yet I fancy,\' said Glaucus, \'that these people are not absolutelyatheists. I am told that they believe in a God--nay, in a future state.\'\'Quite a mistake, my dear Glaucus,\' said the philosopher.  \'I haveconferred with them--they laughed in my face when I talked of Pluto andHades.\'\'O ye gods!\' exclaimed the goldsmith, in horror; \'are there any of thesewretches in Pompeii?\'\'I know there are a few: but they meet so privately that it isimpossible to discover who they are.\'As Glaucus turned away, a sculptor, who was a great enthusiast in hisart, looked after him admiringly.\'Ah!\' said he, \'if we could get him on the arena--there would be a modelfor you! What limbs! what a head! he ought to have been a gladiator!  Asubject--a subject--worthy of our art!  Why don\'t they give him to thelion?\'Meanwhile Fulvius, the Roman poet, whom his contemporaries declaredimmortal, and who, but for this history, would never have been heard ofin our neglectful age, came eagerly up to Glaucus. \'Oh, my Athenian, myGlaucus, you have come to hear my ode!  That is indeed an honour; you, aGreek--to whom the very language of common life is poetry.  How I thankyou. It is but a trifle; but if I secure your approbation, perhaps I mayget an introduction to Titus.  Oh, Glaucus! a poet without a patron isan amphora without a label; the wine may be good, but nobody will laudit!  And what says Pythagoras?--""Frankincense to the gods, but praise toman."" A patron, then, is the poet\'s priest: he procures him the incense,and obtains him his believers.\'\'But all Pompeii is your patron, and every portico an altar in yourpraise.\'\'Ah! the poor Pompeians are very civil--they love to honour merit. Butthey are only the inhabitants of a petty town--spero meliora! Shall wewithin?\'\'Certainly; we lose time till we hear your poem.\'At this instant there was a rush of some twenty persons from the bathsinto the portico; and a slave stationed at the door of a small corridornow admitted the poet, Glaucus, Clodius, and a troop of the bard\'s otherfriends, into the passage.\'A poor place this, compared with the Roman thermae!\' said Lepidus,disdainfully.\'Yet is there some taste in the ceiling,\' said Glaucus, who was in amood to be pleased with everything; pointing to the stars which studdedthe roof.Lepidus shrugged his shoulders, but was too languid to reply.They now entered a somewhat spacious chamber, which served for thepurposes of the apodyterium (that is, a place where the bathers preparedthemselves for their luxurious ablutions).  The vaulted ceiling wasraised from a cornice, glowingly colored with motley and grotesquepaintings; the ceiling itself was paneled in white compartments borderedwith rich crimson; the unsullied and shining floor was paved with whitemosaics, and along the walls were ranged benches for the accommodationof the loiterers.  This chamber did not possess the numerous andspacious windows which Vitruvius attributes to his more magnificentfrigidarium.  The Pompeians, as all the southern Italians, were fond ofbanishing the light of their sultry skies, and combined in theirvoluptuous associations the idea of luxury with darkness.  Two windowsof glass alone admitted the soft and shaded ray; and the compartment inwhich one of these casements was placed was adorned with a large reliefof the destruction of the Titans.In this apartment Fulvius seated himself with a magisterial air, and hisaudience gathering round him, encouraged him to commence his recital.The poet did not require much pressing.  He drew forth from his vest aroll of papyrus, and after hemming three times, as much to commandsilence as to clear his voice, he began that wonderful ode, of which, tothe great mortification of the author of this history, no single versecan be discovered.By the plaudits he received, it was doubtless worthy of his fame; andGlaucus was the only listener who did not find it excel the best odes ofHorace.The poem concluded, those who took only the cold bath began to undress;they suspended their garments on hooks fastened in the wall, andreceiving, according to their condition, either from their own slaves orthose of the thermae, loose robes in exchange, withdrew into thatgraceful circular building which yet exists, to shame the unlavingposterity of the south.The more luxurious departed by another door to the tepidarium, a placewhich was heated to a voluptuous warmth, partly by a movable fireplace,principally by a suspended pavement, beneath which was conducted thecaloric of the laconicum.Here this portion of the intended bathers, after unrobing themselves,remained for some time enjoying the artificial warmth of the luxuriousair. And this room, as befitted its important rank in the long processof ablution, was more richly and elaborately decorated than the rest;the arched roof was beautifully carved and painted; the windows above,of ground glass, admitted but wandering and uncertain rays; below themassive cornices were rows of figures in massive and bold relief; thewalls glowed with crimson, the pavement was skillfully tessellated inwhite mosaics.  Here the habituated bathers, men who bathed seven timesa day, would remain in a state of enervate and speechless lassitude,either before or (mostly) after the water-bath; and many of thesevictims of the pursuit of health turned their listless eyes on thenewcomers, recognizing their friends with a nod, but dreading thefatigue of conversation.From this place the party again diverged, according to their severalfancies, some to the sudatorium, which answered the purpose of ourvapor-baths, and thence to the warm-bath itself; those more accustomedto exercise, and capable of dispensing with so cheap a purchase offatigue, resorted at once to the calidarium, or water-bath.In order to complete this sketch, and give to the reader an adequatenotion of this, the main luxury of the ancients, we will accompanyLepidus, who regularly underwent the whole process, save only the coldbath, which had gone lately out of fashion.  Being then gradually warmedin the tepidarium, which has just been described, the delicate steps ofthe Pompeian elegant were conducted to the sudatorium.  Here let thereader depict to himself the gradual process of the vapor-bath,accompanied by an exhalation of spicy perfumes.  After our bather hadundergone this operation, he was seized by his slaves, who alwaysawaited him at the baths, and the dews of heat were removed by a kind ofscraper, which (by the way) a modern traveler has gravely declared to beused only to remove the dirt, not one particle of which could eversettle on the polished skin of the practised bather. Thence, somewhatcooled, he passed into the water-bath, over which fresh perfumes wereprofusely scattered, and on emerging from the opposite part of the room,a cooling shower played over his head and form.  Then wrapping himselfin a light robe, he returned once more to the tepidarium, where he foundGlaucus, who had not encountered the sudatorium; and now, the maindelight and extravagance of the bath commenced.  Their slaves anointedthe bathers from vials of gold, of alabaster, or of crystal, studdedwith profusest gems, and containing the rarest unguents gathered fromall quarters of the world.  The number of these smegmata used by thewealthy would fill a modern volume--especially if the volume wereprinted by a fashionable publisher; Amaracinum, Megalium, Nardum--omnequod exit in um--while soft music played in an adjacent chamber, andsuch as used the bath in moderation, refreshed and restored by thegrateful ceremony, conversed with all the zest and freshness ofrejuvenated life.\'Blessed be he who invented baths!\' said Glaucus, stretching himselfalong one of those bronze seats (then covered with soft cushions) whichthe visitor to Pompeii sees at this day in that same tepidarium.\'Whether he were Hercules or Bacchus, he deserved deification.\'\'But tell me,\' said a corpulent citizen, who was groaning and wheezingunder the operation of being rubbed down, \'tell me, O Glaucus!--evilchance to thy hands, O slave! why so rough?--tell me--ugh--ugh!--are thebaths at Rome really so magnificent?\' Glaucus turned, and recognizedDiomed, though not without some difficulty, so red and so inflamed werethe good man\'s cheeks by the sudatory and the scraping he had so latelyundergone.  \'I fancy they must be a great deal finer than these.  Eh?\'Suppressing a smile, Glaucus replied:\'Imagine all Pompeii converted into baths, and you will then form anotion of the size of the imperial thermae of Rome.  But a notion of thesize only. Imagine every entertainment for mind and body--enumerate allthe gymnastic games our fathers invented--repeat all the books Italy andGreece have produced--suppose places for all these games, admirers forall these works--add to this, baths of the vastest size, the mostcomplicated construction--intersperse the whole with gardens, withtheatres, with porticoes, with schools--suppose, in one word, a city ofthe gods, composed but of palaces and public edifices, and you may formsome faint idea of the glories of the great baths of Rome.\'\'By Hercules!\' said Diomed, opening his eyes, \'why, it would take aman\'s whole life to bathe!\'\'At Rome, it often does so,\' replied Glaucus, gravely.  \'There are manywho live only at the baths.  They repair there the first hour in whichthe doors are opened, and remain till that in which the doors areclosed.  They seem as if they knew nothing of the rest of Rome, as ifthey despised all other existence.\'\'By Pollux! you amaze me.\'\'Even those who bathe only thrice a day contrive to consume their livesin this occupation.  They take their exercise in the tennis-court or theporticoes, to prepare them for the first bath; they lounge into thetheatre, to refresh themselves after it.  They take their prandium underthe trees, and think over their second bath. By the time it is prepared,the prandium is digested.  From the second bath they stroll into one ofthe peristyles, to hear some new poet recite: or into the library, tosleep over an old one. Then comes the supper, which they still considerbut a part of the bath: and then a third time they bathe again, as thebest place to converse with their friends.\'\'Per Hercle! but we have their imitators at Pompeii.\'\'Yes, and without their excuse.  The magnificent voluptuaries of theRoman baths are happy: they see nothing but gorgeousness and splendor;they visit not the squalid parts of the city; they know not that thereis poverty in the world.  All Nature smiles for them, and her only frownis the last one which sends them to bathe in Cocytus. Believe me, theyare your only true philosophers.\'While Glaucus was thus conversing, Lepidus, with closed eyes and scarceperceptible breath, was undergoing all the mystic operations, not one ofwhich he ever suffered his attendants to omit.  After the perfumes andthe unguents, they scattered over him the luxurious powder whichprevented any further accession of heat: and this being rubbed away bythe smooth surface of the pumice, he began to indue, not the garments hehad put off, but those more festive ones termed \'the synthesis\', withwhich the Romans marked their respect for the coming ceremony of supper,if rather, from its hour (three o\'clock in our measurement of time), itmight not be more fitly denominated dinner.  This done, he at lengthopened his eyes and gave signs of returning life.At the same time, too, Sallust betokened by a long yawn the evidence ofexistence.\'It is supper time,\' said the epicure; \'you, Glaucus and Lepidus, comeand sup with me.\'\'Recollect you are all three engaged to my house next week,\' criedDiomed, who was mightily proud of the acquaintance of men of fashion.\'Ah, ah! we recollect,\' said Sallust; \'the seat of memory, my Diomed, iscertainly in the stomach.\'Passing now once again into the cooler air, and so into the street, ourgallants of that day concluded the ceremony of a Pompeian bath.Chapter VIIIARBACES COGS HIS DICE WITH PLEASURE AND WINS THE GAME.THE evening darkened over the restless city as Apaecides took his way tothe house of the Egyptian.  He avoided the more lighted and populousstreets; and as he strode onward with his head buried in his bosom, andhis arms folded within his robe, there was something startling in thecontrast, which his solemn mien and wasted form presented to thethoughtless brows and animated air of those who occasionally crossed hispath.At length, however, a man of a more sober and staid demeanor, and whohad twice passed him with a curious but doubting look, touched him onthe shoulder.\'Apaecides!\' said he, and he made a rapid sign with his hands: it wasthe sign of the cross.\'Well, Nazarene,\' replied the priest, and his face grew paler; \'whatwouldst thou?\'\'Nay,\' returned the stranger, \'I would not interrupt thy meditations;but the last time we met, I seemed not to be so unwelcome.\'\'You are not unwelcome, Olinthus; but I am sad and weary: nor am I ablethis evening to discuss with you those themes which are most acceptableto you.\'\'O backward of heart!\' said Olinthus, with bitter fervor; and art thousad and weary, and wilt thou turn from the very springs that refresh andheal?\'\'O earth!\' cried the young priest, striking his breast passionately,\'from what regions shall my eyes open to the true Olympus, where thygods really dwell?  Am I to believe with this man, that none whom for somany centuries my fathers worshipped have a being or a name?  Am I tobreak down, as something blasphemous and profane, the very altars whichI have deemed most sacred? or am I to think with Arbaces--what?\' Hepaused, and strode rapidly away in the impatience of a man who strivesto get rid of himself.  But the Nazarene was one of those hardy,vigorous, and enthusiastic men, by whom God in all times has worked therevolutions of earth, and those, above all, in the establishment and inthe reformation of His own religion--men who were formed to convert,because formed to endure.  It is men of this mould whom nothingdiscourages, nothing dismays; in the fervor of belief they are inspiredand they inspire.  Their reason first kindles their passion, but thepassion is the instrument they use; they force themselves into men\'shearts, while they appear only to appeal to their judgment.  Nothing isso contagious as enthusiasm; it is the real allegory of the tale ofOrpheus--it moves stones, it charms brutes.  Enthusiasm is the genius ofsincerity, and truth accomplishes no victories without it.Olinthus did not then suffer Apaecides thus easily to escape him.  Heovertook and addressed him thus:\'I do not wonder, Apaecides, that I distress you; that I shake all theelements of your mind: that you are lost in doubt; that you drift hereand there in the vast ocean of uncertain and benighted thought.  Iwonder not at this, but bear with me a little; watch and pray--thedarkness shall vanish, the storm sleep, and God Himself, as He came ofyore on the seas of Samaria, shall walk over the lulled billows, to thedelivery of your soul.  Ours is a religion jealous in its demands, buthow infinitely prodigal in its gifts! It troubles you for an hour, itrepays you by immortality.\'\'Such promises,\' said Apaecides, sullenly, \'are the tricks by which manis ever gulled.  Oh, glorious were the promises which led me to theshrine of Isis!\'\'But,\' answered the Nazarene, \'ask thy reason, can that religion besound which outrages all morality?  You are told to worship your gods.What are those gods, even according to yourselves?  What their actions,what their attributes?  Are they not all represented to you as theblackest of criminals? yet you are asked to serve them as the holiest ofdivinities. Jupiter himself is a parricide and an adulterer.  What arethe meaner deities but imitators of his vices?  You are told not tomurder, but you worship murderers; you are told not to commit adultery,and you make your prayers to an adulterer!  Oh!  what is this but amockery of the holiest part of man\'s nature, which is faith?  Turn nowto the God, the one, the true God, to whose shrine I would lead you.  IfHe seem to you too sublime, two shadowy, for those human associations,those touching connections between Creator and creature, to which theweak heart clings--contemplate Him in His Son, who put on mortality likeourselves.  His mortality is not indeed declared, like that of yourfabled gods, by the vices of our nature, but by the practice of all itsvirtues.  In Him are united the austerest morals with the tenderestaffections.  If He were but a mere man, He had been worthy to become agod.  You honour Socrates--he has his sect, his disciples, his schools.But what are the doubtful virtues of the Athenian, to the bright, theundisputed, the active, the unceasing, the devoted holiness of Christ?I speak to you now only of His human character.  He came in that as thepattern of future ages, to show us the form of virtue which Platothirsted to see embodied. This was the true sacrifice that He made forman; but the halo that encircled His dying hour not only brightenedearth, but opened to us the sight of heaven!  You are touched--you aremoved.  God works in your heart.  His Spirit is with you.  Come, resistnot the holy impulse; come at once--unhesitatingly.  A few of us are nowassembled to expound the word of God.  Come, let me guide you to them.You are sad, you are weary.  Listen, then, to the words of God: ""Come tome"", saith He, ""all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest!""\'\'I cannot now,\' said Apaecides; \'another time.\'\'Now--now!\' exclaimed Olinthus, earnestly, and clasping him by the arm.But Apaecides, yet unprepared for the renunciation of that faith--thatlife, for which he had sacrificed so much, and still haunted by thepromises of the Egyptian, extricated himself forcibly from the grasp;and feeling an effort necessary to conquer the irresolution which theeloquence of the Christian had begun to effect in his heated andfeverish mind, he gathered up his robes and fled away with a speed thatdefied pursuit.Breathless and exhausted, he arrived at last in a remote and sequesteredpart of the city, and the lone house of the Egyptian stood before him.As he paused to recover himself, the moon emerged from a silver cloud,and shone full upon the walls of that mysterious habitation.No other house was near--the darksome vines clustered far and wide infront of the building and behind it rose a copse of lofty forest trees,sleeping in the melancholy moonlight; beyond stretched the dim outlineof the distant hills, and amongst them the quiet crest of Vesuvius, notthen so lofty as the traveler beholds it now.Apaecides passed through the arching vines, and arrived at the broad andspacious portico.  Before it, on either side of the steps, reposed theimage of the Egyptian sphinx, and the moonlight gave an additional andyet more solemn calm to those large, and harmonious, and passionlessfeatures, in which the sculptors of that type of wisdom united so muchof loveliness with awe; half way up the extremities of the stepsdarkened the green and massive foliage of the aloe, and the shadow ofthe eastern palm cast its long and unwaving boughs partially over themarble surface of the stairs.Something there was in the stillness of the place, and the strangeaspect of the sculptured sphinxes, which thrilled the blood of thepriest with a nameless and ghostly fear, and he longed even for an echoto his noiseless steps as he ascended to the threshold.He knocked at the door, over which was wrought an inscription incharacters unfamiliar to his eyes; it opened without a sound, and a tallEthiopian slave, without question or salutation, motioned to him toproceed.The wide hall was lighted by lofty candelabra of elaborate bronze, andround the walls were wrought vast hieroglyphics, in dark and solemncolors, which contrasted strangely with the bright hues and gracefulshapes with which the inhabitants of Italy decorated their abodes.  Atthe extremity of the hall, a slave, whose countenance, though notAfrican, was darker by many shades than the usual color of the south,advanced to meet him.\'I seek Arbaces,\' said the priest; but his voice trembled even in hisown ear.  The slave bowed his head in silence, and leading Apaecides toa wing without the hall, conducted him up a narrow staircase, and thentraversing several rooms, in which the stern and thoughtful beauty ofthe sphinx still made the chief and most impressive object of thepriest\'s notice, Apaecides found himself in a dim and half-lightedchamber, in the presence of the Egyptian.Arbaces was seated before a small table, on which lay unfolded severalscrolls of papyrus, impressed with the same character as that on thethreshold of the mansion.  A small tripod stood at a little distance,from the incense in which the smoke slowly rose.  Near this was a vastglobe, depicting the signs of heaven; and upon another table lay severalinstruments, of curious and quaint shape, whose uses were unknown toApaecides.  The farther extremity of the room was concealed by acurtain, and the oblong window in the roof admitted the rays of themoon, mingling sadly with the single lamp which burned in the apartment.\'Seat yourself, Apaecides,\' said the Egyptian, without rising.The young man obeyed.\'You ask me,\' resumed Arbaces, after a short pause, in which he seemedabsorbed in thought--\'You ask me, or would do so, the mightiest secretswhich the soul of man is fitted to receive; it is the enigma of lifeitself that you desire me to solve.  Placed like children in the dark,and but for a little while, in this dim and confined existence, we shapeour spectres in the obscurity; our thoughts now sink back into ourselvesin terror, now wildly plunge themselves into the guideless gloom,guessing what it may contain; stretching our helpless hands here andthere, lest, blindly, we stumble upon some hidden danger; not knowingthe limits of our boundary, now feeling them suffocate us withcompression, now seeing them extend far away till they vanish intoeternity.  In this state all wisdom consists necessarily in the solutionof two questions: ""What are we to believe? and What are we to reject?""These questions you desire me to decide.\'Apaecides bowed his head in assent.\'Man must have some belief,\' continued the Egyptian, in a tone ofsadness. \'He must fasten his hope to something: is our common naturethat you inherit when, aghast and terrified to see that in which youhave been taught to place your faith swept away, you float over a drearyand shoreless sea of incertitude, you cry for help, you ask for someplank to cling to, some land, however dim and distant, to attain.  Well,then, have not forgotten our conversation of to-day?\'\'Forgotten!\'\'I confessed to you that those deities for whom smoke so many altarswere but inventions.  I confessed to you that our rites and ceremonieswere but mummeries, to delude and lure the herd to their proper good.  Iexplained to you that from those delusions came the bonds of society,the harmony of the world, the power of the wise; that power is in theobedience of the vulgar. Continue we then these salutary delusions--ifman must have some belief, continue to him that which his fathers havemade dear to him, and which custom sanctifies and strengthens.  Inseeking a subtler faith for us, whose senses are too spiritual for thegross one, let us leave others that support which crumbles fromourselves.  This is wise--it is benevolent.\'\'Proceed.\'\'This being settled,\' resumed the Egyptian, \'the old landmarks beingleft uninjured for those whom we are about to desert, we gird up ourloins and depart to new climes of faith.  Dismiss at once from yourrecollection, from your thought, all that you have believed before.Suppose the mind a blank, an unwritten scroll, fit to receiveimpressions for the first time.  Look round the world--observe itsorder--its regularity--its design.  Something must have created it--thedesign speaks a designer: in that certainty we first touch land.  Butwhat is that something?--A god, you cry.  Stay--no confusedand confusing names.  Of that which created the world, we know,we can know, nothing, save these attributes--power and unvaryingregularity--stern, crushing, relentless regularity--heeding noindividual cases--rolling--sweeping--burning on; no matter whatscattered hearts, severed from the general mass, fall ground andscorched beneath its wheels. The mixture of evil with good--theexistence of suffering and of crime--in all times have perplexed thewise.  They created a god--they supposed him benevolent.  How then camethis evil? why did he permit it--nay, why invent, why perpetuate it?  Toaccount for this, the Persian creates a second spirit, whose nature isevil, and supposes a continual war between that and the god of good.  Inour own shadowy and tremendous Typhon, the Egyptians image a similardemon.  Perplexing blunder that yet more bewilders us!--folly that arosefrom the vain delusion that makes a palpable, a corporeal, a humanbeing, of this unknown power--that clothes the Invisible with attributesand a nature similar to the Seen.  No: to this designer let us give aname that does not command our bewildering associations, and the mysterybecomes more clear--that name is NECESSITY.  Necessity, say the Greeks,compels the gods.  Then why the gods?--their agency becomesunnecessary--dismiss them at once. Necessity is the ruler of all wesee--power, regularity--these two qualities make its nature.  Would youask more?--you can learn nothing: whether it be eternal--whether itcompel us, its creatures, to new careers after that darkness which wecall death--we cannot tell.  There leave we this ancient, unseen,unfathomable power, and come to that which, to our eyes, is the greatminister of its functions. This we can task more, from this we can learnmore: its evidence is around us--its name is NATURE.  The error of thesages has been to direct their researches to the attributes ofnecessity, where all is gloom and blindness. Had they confined theirresearches to Nature--what of knowledge might we not already haveachieved?  Here patience, examination, are never directed in vain.  Wesee what we explore; our minds ascend a palpable ladder of causes andeffects. Nature is the great agent of the external universe, andNecessity imposes upon it the laws by which it acts, and imparts to usthe powers by which we examine; those powers are curiosity andmemory--their union is reason, their perfection is wisdom.  Well, then,I examine by the help of these powers this inexhaustible Nature.  Iexamine the earth, the air, the ocean, the heaven: I find that all havea mystic sympathy with each other--that the moon sways the tides--thatthe air maintains the earth, and is the medium of the life and sense ofthings--that by the knowledge of the stars we measure the limits of theearth--that we portion out the epochs of time--that by their pale lightwe are guided into the abyss of the past--that in their solemn lore wediscern the destinies of the future. And thus, while we know not thatwhich Necessity is, we learn, at least, her decrees.  And now, whatmorality do we glean from this religion?--for religion it is.  I believein two deities--Nature and Necessity; I worship the last by reverence,the first by investigation.  What is the morality my religion teaches?This--all things are subject but to general rules; the sun shines forthe joy of the many--it may bring sorrow to the few; the night shedssleep on the multitude--but it harbors murder as well as rest; theforests adorn the earth--but shelter the serpent and the lion; the oceansupports a thousand barks--but it engulfs the one. It is only thus forthe general, and not for the universal benefit, that Nature acts, andNecessity speeds on her awful course.  This is the morality of the dreadagents of the world--it is mine, who am their creature.  I wouldpreserve the delusions of priestcraft, for they are serviceable to themultitude; I would impart to man the arts I discover, the sciences Iperfect; I would speed the vast career of civilizing lore: in this Iserve the mass, I fulfill the general law, I execute the great moralthat Nature preaches.  For myself I claim the individual exception; Iclaim it for the wise--satisfied that my individual actions are nothingin the great balance of good and evil; satisfied that the product of myknowledge can give greater blessings to the mass than my desires canoperate evil on the few (for the first can extend to remotest regionsand humanize nations yet unborn), I give to the world wisdom, to myselffreedom. I enlighten the lives of others, and I enjoy my own.  Yes; ourwisdom is eternal, but our life is short: make the most of it while itlasts. Surrender thy youth to pleasure, and thy senses to delight.  Sooncomes the hour when the wine-cup is shattered, and the garlands shallcease to bloom.  Enjoy while you may.  Be still, O Apaecides, my pupiland my follower!  I will teach thee the mechanism of Nature, her darkestand her wildest secrets--the lore which fools call magic--and the mightymysteries of the stars. By this shalt thou discharge thy duty to themass; by this shalt thou enlighten thy race.  But I will lead thee alsoto pleasures of which the vulgar do not dream; and the day which thougivest to men shall be followed by the sweet night which thousurrenderest to thyself.\'As the Egyptian ceased there rose about, around, beneath, the softestmusic that Lydia ever taught, or Iona ever perfected.  It came like astream of sound, bathing the senses unawares; enervating, subduing withdelight.  It seemed the melodies of invisible spirits, such as theshepherd might have heard in the golden age, floating through the valesof Thessaly, or in the noontide glades of Paphos.  The words which hadrushed to the lip of Apaecides, in answer to the sophistries of theEgyptian, died tremblingly away.  He felt it as a profanation to breakupon that enchanted strain--the susceptibility of his excited nature,the Greek softness and ardour of his secret soul, were swayed andcaptured by surprise.  He sank on the seat with parted lips andthirsting ear; while in a chorus of voices, bland and melting as thosewhich waked Psyche in the halls of love, rose the following song:                THE HYMN OF EROS       By the cool banks where soft Cephisus flows,         A voice sail\'d trembling down the waves of air;        The leaves blushed brighter in the Teian\'s rose,         The doves couch\'d breathless in their summer lair;       While from their hands the purple flowerets fell,         The laughing Hours stood listening in the sky;--       From Pan\'s green cave to AEgle\'s haunted cell,         Heaved the charm\'d earth in one delicious sigh.       Love, sons of earth!  I am the Power of Love!         Eldest of all the gods, with Chaos born;        My smile sheds light along the courts above,         My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn.       Mine are the stars--there, ever as ye gaze,         Ye meet the deep spell of my haunting eyes;        Mine is the moon--and, mournful if her rays,         \'Tis that she lingers where her Carian lies.       The flowers are mine--the blushes of the rose,         The violet--charming Zephyr to the shade;        Mine the quick light that in the Maybeam glows,         And mine the day-dream in the lonely glade.       Love, sons of earth--for love is earth\'s soft lore,         Look where ye will--earth overflows with ME;        Learn from the waves that ever kiss the shore,         And the winds nestling on the heaving sea.       \'All teaches love!\'--The sweet voice, like a dream,         Melted in light; yet still the airs above,        The waving sedges, and the whispering stream,         And the green forest rustling, murmur\'d \'LOVE!\'As the voices died away, the Egyptian seized the hand of Apaecides, andled him, wandering, intoxicated, yet half-reluctant, across the chambertowards the curtain at the far end; and now, from behind that curtain,there seemed to burst a thousand sparkling stars; the veil itself,hitherto dark, was now lighted by these fires behind into the tenderestblue of heaven.  It represented heaven itself--such a heaven, as in thenights of June might have shone down over the streams of Castaly.  Hereand there were painted rosy and aerial clouds, from which smiled, by thelimner\'s art, faces of divinest beauty, and on which reposed the shapesof which Phidias and Apelles dreamed.  And the stars which studded thetransparent azure rolled rapidly as they shone, while the music, thatagain woke with a livelier and lighter sound, seemed to imitate themelody of the joyous spheres.\'Oh! what miracle is this, Arbaces,\' said Apaecides in falteringaccents. \'After having denied the gods, art thou about to reveal tome...\'\'Their pleasures!\' interrupted Arbaces, in a tone so different from itsusual cold and tranquil harmony that Apaecides started, and thought theEgyptian himself transformed; and now, as they neared the curtain, awild--a loud--an exulting melody burst from behind its concealment.With that sound the veil was rent in twain--it parted--it seemed tovanish into air: and a scene, which no Sybarite ever more than rivalled,broke upon the dazzled gaze of the youthful priest.  A vast banquet-roomstretched beyond, blazing with countless lights, which filled the warmair with the scents of frankincense, of jasmine, of violets, of myrrh;all that the most odorous flowers, all that the most costly spices coulddistil, seemed gathered into one ineffable and ambrosial essence: fromthe light columns that sprang upwards to the airy roof, hung draperiesof white, studded with golden stars.  At the extremities of the room twofountains cast up a spray, which, catching the rays of the roseatelight, glittered like countless diamonds. In the centre of the room asthey entered there rose slowly from the floor, to the sound of unseenminstrelsy, a table spread with all the viands which sense ever devotedto fancy, and vases of that lost Myrrhine fabric, so glowing in itscolors, so transparent in its material, were crowned with the exotics ofthe East.  The couches, to which this table was the centre, were coveredwith tapestries of azure and gold; and from invisible tubes the vaultedroof descended showers of fragrant waters, that cooled the deliciousair, and contended with the lamps, as if the spirits of wave and firedisputed which element could furnish forth the most delicious odorous.And now, from behind the snowy draperies, trooped such forms as Adonisbeheld when he lay on the lap of Venus.  They came, some with garlands,others with lyres; they surrounded the youth, they led his steps to thebanquet.  They flung the chaplets round him in rosy chains.  Theearth--the thought of earth, vanished from his soul.  He imaginedhimself in a dream, and suppressed his breath lest he should wake toosoon; the senses, to which he had never yielded as yet, beat in hisburning pulse, and confused his dizzy and reeling sight.  And while thusamazed and lost, once again, but in brisk and Bacchic measures, rose themagic strain:                ANACREONTIC       In the veins of the calix foams and glows          The blood of the mantling vine,        But oh! in the bowl of Youth there glows          A Lesbian, more divine!              Bright, bright,             As the liquid light,         Its waves through thine eyelids shine!       Fill up, fill up, to the sparkling brim,          The juice of the young Lyaeus;        The grape is the key that we owe to him          From the gaol of the world to free us.              Drink, drink!             What need to shrink,         When the lambs alone can see us?       Drink, drink, as I quaff from thine eyes          The wine of a softer tree;        Give the smiles to the god of the grape--thy sighs,          Beloved one, give to me.              Turn, turn,             My glances burn,         And thirst for a look from thee!As the song ended, a group of three maidens, entwined with a chain ofstarred flowers, and who, while they imitated, might have shamed theGraces, advanced towards him in the gliding measures of the Ioniandance: such as the Nereids wreathed in moonlight on the yellow sands ofthe AEgean wave--such as Cytherea taught her handmaids in themarriage-feast of Psyche and her son.Now approaching, they wreathed their chaplet round his head; nowkneeling, the youngest of the three proffered him the bowl, from whichthe wine of Lesbos foamed and sparkled.  The youth resisted no more, hegrasped the intoxicating cup, the blood mantled fiercely through hisveins.  He sank upon the breast of the nymph who sat beside him, andturning with swimming eyes to seek for Arbaces, whom he had lost in thewhirl of his emotions, he beheld him seated beneath a canopy at theupper end of the table, and gazing upon him with a smile that encouragedhim to pleasure.  He beheld him, but not as he had hitherto seen, withdark and sable garments, with a brooding and solemn brow: a robe thatdazzled the sight, so studded was its whitest surface with gold andgems, blazed upon his majestic form; white roses, alternated with theemerald and the ruby, and shaped tiara-like, crowned his raven locks.He appeared, like Ulysses, to have gained the glory of a secondyouth--his features seemed to have exchanged thought for beauty, and hetowered amidst the loveliness that surrounded him, in all the beamingand relaxing benignity of the Olympian god.\'Drink, feast, love, my pupil!\' said he, \'blush not that thou artpassionate and young.  That which thou art, thou feelest in thy veins:that which thou shalt be, survey!\'With this he pointed to a recess, and the eyes of Apaecides, followingthe gesture, beheld on a pedestal, placed between the statues of Bacchusand Idalia, the form of a skeleton.\'Start not,\' resumed the Egyptian; \'that friendly guest admonishes usbut of the shortness of life.  From its jaws I hear a voice that summonsus to ENJOY.\'As he spoke, a group of nymphs surrounded the statue; they laid chapletson its pedestal, and, while the cups were emptied and refilled at thatglowing board, they sang the following strain:         BACCHIC HYMNS TO THE IMAGE OF DEATH                    I        Thou art in the land of the shadowy Host,           Thou that didst drink and love:         By the Solemn River, a gliding ghost,           But thy thought is ours above!                If memory yet can fly,                Back to the golden sky,           And mourn the pleasures lost!         By the ruin\'d hall these flowers we lay,           Where thy soul once held its palace;         When the rose to thy scent and sight was gay,           And the smile was in the chalice,                And the cithara\'s voice                Could bid thy heart rejoice           When night eclipsed the day.Here a new group advancing, turned the tide of the music into a quickerand more joyous strain.                    II        Death, death is the gloomy shore           Where we all sail--        Soft, soft, thou gliding oar;           Blow soft, sweet gale!         Chain with bright wreaths the Hours;           Victims if all         Ever, \'mid song and flowers,           Victims should fall!Pausing for a moment, yet quicker and quicker danced the silver-footedmusic:        Since Life\'s so short, we\'ll live to laugh,           Ah! wherefore waste a minute!         If youth\'s the cup we yet can quaff,           Be love the pearl within it!A third band now approached with brimming cups, which they poured inlibation upon that strange altar; and once more, slow and solemn, rosethe changeful melody:                  III        Thou art welcome, Guest of gloom,           From the far and fearful sea!         When the last rose sheds its bloom,           Our board shall be spread with thee!              All hail, dark Guest!           Who hath so fair a plea           Our welcome Guest to be,           As thou, whose solemn hall           At last shall feast us all           In the dim and dismal coast?           Long yet be we the Host!           And thou, Dead Shadow, thou,           All joyless though thy brow,               Thou--but our passing GUEST!At this moment, she who sat beside Apaecides suddenly took up the song:                    IV        Happy is yet our doom,           The earth and the sun are ours!         And far from the dreary tomb           Speed the wings of the rosy Hours--          Sweet is for thee the bowl,              Sweet are thy looks, my love;           I fly to thy tender soul,              As bird to its mated dove!                Take me, ah, take!           Clasp\'d to thy guardian breast,           Soft let me sink to rest:                But wake me--ah, wake!           And tell me with words and sighs,           But more with thy melting eyes,                That my sun is not set--         That the Torch is not quench\'d at the Urn           That we love, and we breathe, and burn,                Tell me--thou lov\'st me yet!BOOK THE SECONDChapter IA FLASH HOUSE IN POMPEII, AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CLASSIC RING.TO one of those parts of Pompeii, which were tenanted not by the lordsof pleasure, but by its minions and its victims; the haunt of gladiatorsand prize-fighters; of the vicious and the penniless; of the savage andthe obscene; the Alsatia of an ancient city--we are now transported.It was a large room, that opened at once on the confined and crowdedlane. Before the threshold was a group of men, whose iron andwell-strung muscles, whose short and Herculean necks, whose hardy andreckless countenances, indicated the champions of the arena. On a shelf,without the shop, were ranged jars of wine and oil; and right over thiswas inserted in the wall a coarse painting, which exhibited gladiatorsdrinking--so ancient and so venerable is the custom of signs!  Withinthe room were placed several small tables, arranged somewhat in themodern fashion of \'boxes\', and round these were seated several knots ofmen, some drinking, some playing at dice, some at that more skilful gamecalled \'duodecim scriptae\', which certain of the blundering learned havemistaken for chess, though it rather, perhaps, resembled backgammon ofthe two, and was usually, though not always, played by the assistance ofdice.  The hour was in the early forenoon, and nothing better, perhaps,than that unseasonable time itself denoted the habitual indolence ofthese tavern loungers.Yet, despite the situation of the house and the character of itsinmates, it indicated none of that sordid squalor which would havecharacterized a similar haunt in a modern city.  The gay disposition ofall the Pompeians, who sought, at least, to gratify the sense even wherethey neglected the mind, was typified by the gaudy colors whichdecorated the walls, and the shapes, fantastic but not inelegant, inwhich the lamps, the drinking-cups, the commonest household utensils,were wrought.\'By Pollux!\' said one of the gladiators, as he leaned against the wallof the threshold, \'the wine thou sellest us, old Silenus\'--and as hespoke he slapped a portly personage on the back--\'is enough to thin thebest blood in one\'s veins.\'The man thus caressingly saluted, and whose bared arms, white apron, andkeys and napkin tucked carelessly within his girdle, indicated him to bethe host of the tavern, was already passed into the autumn of his years;but his form was still so robust and athletic, that he might have shamedeven the sinewy shapes beside him, save that the muscles had seeded, asit were, into flesh, that the cheeks were swelled and bloated, and theincreasing stomach threw into shade the vast and massive chest whichrose above it.\'None of thy scurrilous blusterings with me,\' growled the giganticlandlord, in the gentle semi-roar of an insulted tiger; \'my wine is goodenough for a carcass which shall so soon soak the dust of thespoliarium.\'\'Croakest thou thus, old raven!\' returned the gladiator, laughingscornfully; \'thou shalt live to hang thyself with despite when thouseest me win the palm crown; and when I get the purse at theamphitheatre, as I certainly shall, my first vow to Hercules shall be toforswear thee and thy vile potations evermore.\'\'Hear to him--hear to this modest Pyrgopolinices!  He has certainlyserved under Bombochides Cluninstaridysarchides,\' cried the host.\'Sporus, Niger, Tetraides, he declares he shall win the purse from you.Why, by the gods! each of your muscles is strong enough to stifle allhis body, or I know nothing of the arena!\'\'Ha!\' said the gladiator, coloring with rising fury, \'our lanista wouldtell a different story.\'\'What story could he tell against me, vain Lydon?\' said Tetraides,frowning.\'Or me, who have conquered in fifteen fights?\' said the gigantic Niger,stalking up to the gladiator.\'Or me?\' grunted Sporus, with eyes of fire.\'Tush!\' said Lydon, folding his arms, and regarding his rivals with areckless air of defiance.  \'The time of trial will soon come; keep yourvalor till then.\'\'Ay, do,\' said the surly host; \'and if I press down my thumb to saveyou, may the Fates cut my thread!\'\'Your rope, you mean,\' said Lydon, sneeringly: \'here is a sesterce tobuy one.\'The Titan wine-vender seized the hand extended to him, and griped it inso stern a vice that the blood spirted from the fingers\' ends over thegarments of the bystanders.They set up a savage laugh.\'I will teach thee, young braggart, to play the Macedonian with me!  Iam no puny Persian, I warrant thee!  What, man!  have I not foughttwenty years in the ring, and never lowered my arms once?  And have Inot received the rod from the editor\'s own hand as a sign of victory,and as a grace to retirement on my laurels?  And am I now to be lecturedby a boy?\' So saying, he flung the hand from him in scorn.Without changing a muscle, but with the same smiling face with which hehad previously taunted mine host, did the gladiator brave the painfulgrasp he had undergone.  But no sooner was his hand released, than,crouching for one moment as a wild cat crouches, you might see his hairbristle on his head and beard, and with a fierce and shrill yell hesprang on the throat of the giant, with an impetus that threw him, vastand sturdy as he was, from his balance--and down, with the crash of afalling rock, he fell--while over him fell also his ferocious foe.Our host, perhaps, had had no need of the rope so kindly recommended tohim by Lydon, had he remained three minutes longer in that position.But, summoned to his assistance by the noise of his fall, a woman, whohad hitherto kept in an inner apartment, rushed to the scene of battle.This new ally was in herself a match for the gladiator; she was tall,lean, and with arms that could give other than soft embraces.  In fact,the gentle helpmate of Burbo the wine-seller had, like himself, foughtin the lists--nay under the emperor\'s eye.  And Burbo himself--Burbo,the unconquered in the field, according to report, now and then yieldedthe palm to his soft Stratonice.  This sweet creature no sooner saw theimminent peril that awaited her worse half, than without other weaponsthan those with which Nature had provided her, she darted upon theincumbent gladiator, and, clasping him round the waist with her long andsnakelike arms, lifted him by a sudden wrench from the body of herhusband, leaving only his hands still clinging to the throat of his foe.So have we seen a dog snatched by the hind legs from the strife with afallen rival in the arms of some envious groom; so have we seen one halfof him high in air--passive and offenceless--while the other half, head,teeth, eyes, claws, seemed buried and engulfed in the mangled andprostrate enemy.  Meanwhile, the gladiators, lapped, and pampered, andglutted upon blood, crowded delightedly round the combatants--theirnostrils distended--their lips grinning--their eyes gloatingly fixed onthe bloody throat of the one and the indented talons of the other.\'Habet! (he has got it!) habet!\' cried they, with a sort of yell,rubbing their nervous hands.\'Non habeo, ye liars; I have not got it!\' shouted the host, as with amighty effort he wrenched himself from those deadly hands, and rose tohis feet, breathless, panting, lacerated, bloody; and fronting, withreeling eyes, the glaring look and grinning teeth of his baffled foe,now struggling (but struggling with disdain) in the gripe of the sturdyamazon.\'Fair play!\' cried the gladiators: \'one to one\'; and, crowding roundLydon and the woman, they separated our pleasing host from his courteousguest.But Lydon, feeling ashamed at his present position, and endeavoring invain to shake off the grasp of the virago, slipped his hand into hisgirdle, and drew forth a short knife.  So menacing was his look, sobrightly gleamed the blade, that Stratonice, who was used only to thatfashion of battle which we moderns call the pugilistic, started back inalarm.\'O gods!\' cried she, \'the ruffian!--he has concealed weapons!  Is thatfair? Is that like a gentleman and a gladiator?  No, indeed, I scornsuch fellows.\' With that she contemptuously turned her back on thegladiator, and hastened to examine the condition of her husband.But he, as much inured to the constitutional exercises as an Englishbull-dog is to a contest with a more gentle antagonist, had alreadyrecovered himself.  The purple hues receded from the crimson surface ofhis cheek, the veins of the forehead retired into their wonted size.  Heshook himself with a complacent grunt, satisfied that he was stillalive, and then looking at his foe from head to foot with an air of moreapprobation than he had ever bestowed upon him before:\'By Castor!\' said he, \'thou art a stronger fellow than I took thee for!I see thou art a man of merit and virtue; give me thy hand, my hero!\'\'Jolly old Burbo!\' cried the gladiators, applauding, \'staunch to thebackbone.  Give him thy hand, Lydon.\'\'Oh, to be sure,\' said the gladiator: \'but now I have tasted his blood,I long to lap the whole.\'\'By Hercules!\' returned the host, quite unmoved, \'that is the truegladiator feeling.  Pollux! to think what good training may make a man;why, a beast could not be fiercer!\'\'A beast!  O dullard! we beat the beasts hollow!\' cried Tetraides.\'Well, well,\' said Stratonice, who was now employed in smoothing her hairand adjusting her dress, \'if ye are all good friends again, I recommendyou to be quiet and orderly; for some young noblemen, your patrons andbackers, have sent to say they will come here to pay you a visit: theywish to see you more at their ease than at the schools, before they makeup their bets on the great fight at the amphitheatre. So they alwayscome to my house for that purpose: they know we only receive the bestgladiators in Pompeii--our society is very select--praised be the gods!\'\'Yes,\' continued Burbo, drinking off a bowl, or rather a pail of wine,\'a man who has won my laurels can only encourage the brave. Lydon,drink, my boy; may you have an honorable old age like mine!\'\'Come here,\' said Stratonice, drawing her husband to her affectionatelyby the ears, in that caress which Tibullus has so prettilydescribed--\'Come here!\'\'Not so hard, she-wolf! thou art worse than the gladiator,\' murmured thehuge jaws of Burbo.\'Hist!\' said she, whispering him; \'Calenus has just stole in, disguised,by the back way.  I hope he has brought the sesterces.\'\'Ho! ho! I will join him,\' said Burbo; \'meanwhile, I say, keep a sharpeye on the cups--attend to the score.  Let them not cheat thee, wife;they are heroes, to be sure, but then they are arrant rogues: Cacus wasnothing to them.\'\'Never fear me, fool!\' was the conjugal reply; and Burbo, satisfied withthe dear assurance, strode through the apartment, and sought thepenetralia of his house.\'So those soft patrons are coming to look at our muscles,\' said Niger.\'Who sent to previse thee of it, my mistress?\'\'Lepidus.  He brings with him Clodius, the surest better in Pompeii, andthe young Greek, Glaucus.\'\'A wager on a wager,\' cried Tetraides; \'Clodius bets on me, for twentysesterces!  What say you, Lydon?\'\'He bets on me!\' said Lydon.\'No, on me!\' grunted Sporus.\'Dolts! do you think he would prefer any of you to Niger?\' said theathletic, thus modestly naming himself.\'Well, well,\' said Stratonice, as she pierced a huge amphora for herguests, who had now seated themselves before one of the tables, \'greatmen and brave, as ye all think yourselves, which of you will fight theNumidian lion in case no malefactor should be found to deprive you ofthe option?\'\'I who have escaped your arms, stout Stratonice,\' said Lydon, \'mightsafely, I think, encounter the lion.\'\'But tell me,\' said Tetraides, \'where is that pretty young slave ofyours--the blind girl, with bright eyes?  I have not seen her a longtime.\'\'Oh! she is too delicate for you, my son of Neptune,\' said the hostess,\'and too nice even for us, I think.  We send her into the town to sellflowers and sing to the ladies: she makes us more money so than shewould by waiting on you.  Besides, she has often other employments whichlie under the rose.\'\'Other employments!\' said Niger; \'why, she is too young for them.\'\'Silence, beast!\' said Stratonice; \'you think there is no play but theCorinthian.  If Nydia were twice the age she is at present, she would beequally fit for Vesta--poor girl!\'\'But, hark ye, Stratonice,\' said Lydon; \'how didst thou come by sogentle and delicate a slave?  She were more meet for the handmaid ofsome rich matron of Rome than for thee.\'\'That is true,\' returned Stratonice; \'and some day or other I shall makemy fortune by selling her.  How came I by Nydia, thou askest.\'\'Ay!\'\'Why, thou seest, my slave Staphyla--thou rememberest Staphyla, Niger?\'\'Ay, a large-handed wench, with a face like a comic mask.  How should Iforget her, by Pluto, whose handmaid she doubtless is at this moment!\'\'Tush, brute!--Well, Staphyla died one day, and a great loss she was tome, and I went into the market to buy me another slave.  But, by thegods! they were all grown so dear since I had bought poor Staphyla, andmoney was so scarce, that I was about to leave the place in despair,when a merchant plucked me by the robe.  ""Mistress,"" said he, ""dost thouwant a slave cheap I have a child to sell--a bargain. She is but little,and almost an infant, it is true; but she is quick and quiet, docile andclever, sings well, and is of good blood, I assure you."" ""Of whatcountry?"" said I.  ""Thessalian."" Now I knew the Thessalians were acuteand gentle; so I said I would see the girl.  I found her just as you seeher now, scarcely smaller and scarcely younger in appearance.  Shelooked patient and resigned enough, with her hands crossed on her bosom,and her eyes downcast. I asked the merchant his price: it was moderate,and I bought her at once.  The merchant brought her to my house, anddisappeared in an instant.  Well, my friends, guess my astonishment whenI found she was blind!  Ha! ha! a clever fellow that merchant!  I ran atonce to the magistrates, but the rogue was already gone from Pompeii. SoI was forced to go home in a very ill humor, I assure you; and the poorgirl felt the effects of it too.  But it was not her fault that she wasblind, for she had been so from her birth.  By degrees, we gotreconciled to our purchase.  True, she had not the strength of Staphyla,and was of very little use in the house, but she could soon find her wayabout the town, as well as if she had the eyes of Argus; and when onemorning she brought us home a handful of sesterces, which she said shehad got from selling some flowers she had gathered in our poor littlegarden, we thought the gods had sent her to us.  So from that time welet her go out as she likes, filling her basket with flowers, which shewreathes into garlands after the Thessalian fashion, which pleases thegallants; and the great people seem to take a fancy to her, for theyalways pay her more than they do any other flower-girl, and she bringsall of it home to us, which is more than any other slave would do.  So Iwork for myself, but I shall soon afford from her earnings to buy me asecond Staphyla; doubtless, the Thessalian kidnapper had stolen theblind girl from gentle parents.  Besides her skill in the garlands, shesings and plays on the cithara, which also brings money, and lately--butthat is a secret.\'\'That is a secret! What!\' cried Lydon, \'art thou turned sphinx?\'\'Sphinx, no!--why sphinx?\'\'Cease thy gabble, good mistress, and bring us our meat--I am hungry,\'said Sporus, impatiently.\'And I, too,\' echoed the grim Niger, whetting his knife on the palm ofhis hand.The amazon stalked away to the kitchen, and soon returned with a trayladen with large pieces of meat half-raw: for so, as now, did the heroesof the prize-fight imagine they best sustained their hardihood andferocity: they drew round the table with the eyes of famishedwolves--the meat vanished, the wine flowed.  So leave we those importantpersonages of classic life to follow the steps of Burbo.Chapter IITWO WORTHIES.IN the earlier times of Rome the priesthood was a profession, not oflucre but of honour.  It was embraced by the noblest citizens--it wasforbidden to the plebeians.  Afterwards, and long previous to thepresent date, it was equally open to all ranks; at least, that part ofthe profession which embraced the flamens, or priests--not of religiongenerally but of peculiar gods.  Even the priest of Jupiter (the FlamenDialis) preceded by a lictor, and entitled by his office to the entranceof the senate, at first the especial dignitary of the patricians, wassubsequently the choice of the people.  The less national and lesshonored deities were usually served by plebeian ministers; and manyembraced the profession, as now the Roman Catholic Christians enter themonastic fraternity, less from the impulse of devotion than thesuggestions of a calculating poverty.  Thus Calenus, the priest of Isis,was of the lowest origin.  His relations, though not his parents, werefreedmen.  He had received from them a liberal education, and from hisfather a small patrimony, which he had soon exhausted.  He embraced thepriesthood as a last resource from distress.  Whatever the stateemoluments of the sacred profession, which at that time were probablysmall, the officers of a popular temple could never complain of theprofits of their calling.  There is no profession so lucrative as thatwhich practises on the superstition of the multitude.Calenus had but one surviving relative at Pompeii, and that was Burbo.Various dark and disreputable ties, stronger than those of blood, unitedtogether their hearts and interests; and often the minister of Isisstole disguised and furtively from the supposed austerity of hisdevotions; and gliding through the back door of the retired gladiator, aman infamous alike by vices and by profession, rejoiced to throw off thelast rag of an hypocrisy which, but for the dictates of avarice, hisruling passion, would at all time have sat clumsily upon a nature toobrutal for even the mimicry of virtue.Wrapped in one of those large mantles which came in use among the Romansin proportion as they dismissed the toga, whose ample folds wellconcealed the form, and in which a sort of hood (attached to it)afforded no less a security to the features, Calenus now sat in thesmall and private chamber of the wine-cellar, whence a small passage ranat once to that back entrance, with which nearly all the houses ofPompeii were furnished.Opposite to him sat the sturdy Burbo, carefully counting on a tablebetween them a little pile of coins which the priest had just pouredfrom his purse--for purses were as common then as now, with thisdifference--they were usually better furnished!\'You see,\' said Calenus, \'that we pay you handsomely, and you ought tothank me for recommending you to so advantageous a market.\'\'I do, my cousin, I do,\' replied Burbo, affectionately, as he swept thecoins into a leathern receptacle, which he then deposited in his girdle,drawing the buckle round his capacious waist more closely than he waswont to do in the lax hours of his domestic avocations.  \'And by Isis,Pisis, and Nisis, or whatever other gods there may be in Egypt, mylittle Nydia is a very Hesperides--a garden of gold to me.\'\'She sings well, and plays like a muse,\' returned Calenus; \'those arevirtues that he who employs me always pays liberally.\'\'He is a god,\' cried Burbo, enthusiastically; \'every rich man who isgenerous deserves to be worshipped.  But come, a cup of wine, oldfriend: tell me more about it.  What does she do? she is frightened,talks of her oath, and reveals nothing.\'\'Nor will I, by my right hand!  I, too, have taken that terrible oath ofsecrecy.\'\'Oath! what are oaths to men like us?\'\'True oaths of a common fashion; but this!\'--and the stalwart priestshuddered as he spoke.  \'Yet,\' he continued, in emptying a huge cup ofunmixed wine, \'I own to thee, that it is not so much the oath that Idread as the vengeance of him who proposed it.  By the gods! he is amighty sorcerer, and could draw my confession from the moon, did I dareto make it to her.  Talk no more of this.  By Pollux! wild as thosebanquets are which I enjoy with him, I am never quite at my ease there.I love, my boy, one jolly hour with thee, and one of the plain,unsophisticated, laughing girls that I meet in this chamber, allsmoke-dried though it be, better than whole nights of those magnificentdebauches.\'\'Ho! sayest thou so!  To-morrow night, please the gods, we will havethen a snug carousal.\'\'With all my heart,\' said the priest, rubbing his hands, and drawinghimself nearer to the table.At this moment they heard a slight noise at the door, as of one feelingthe handle.  The priest lowered the hood over his head.\'Tush!\' whispered the host, \'it is but the blind girl,\' as Nydia openedthe door, and entered the apartment.\'Ho! girl, and how durst thou? thou lookest pale--thou hast kept laterevels?  No matter, the young must be always the young,\' said Burbo,encouragingly.The girl made no answer, but she dropped on one of the seats with an airof lassitude.  Her color went and came rapidly: she beat the floorimpatiently with her small feet, then she suddenly raised her face, andsaid with a determined voice:\'Master, you may starve me if you will--you may beat me--you maythreaten me with death--but I will go no more to that unholy place!\'\'How, fool!\' said Burbo, in a savage voice, and his heavy brows metdarkly over his fierce and bloodshot eyes; \'how, rebellious! Take care.\'\'I have said it,\' said the poor girl, crossing her hands on her breast.\'What! my modest one, sweet vestal, thou wilt go no more!  Very well,thou shalt be carried.\'\'I will raise the city with my cries,\' said she, passionately; and thecolor mounted to her brow.\'We will take care of that too; thou shalt go gagged.\'\'Then may the gods help me!\' said Nydia, rising; \'I will appeal to themagistrates.\'\'Thine oath remember!\' said a hollow voice, as for the first timeCalenus joined in the dialogue.At these words a trembling shook the frame of the unfortunate girl; sheclasped her hands imploringly.  \'Wretch that I am!\' she cried, and burstviolently into sobs.Whether or not it was the sound of that vehement sorrow which broughtthe gentle Stratonice to the spot, her grisly form at this momentappeared in the chamber.\'How now? what hast thou been doing with my slave, brute?\' said she,angrily, to Burbo.\'Be quiet, wife,\' said he, in a tone half-sullen, half-timid; \'you wantnew girdles and fine clothes, do you?  Well then, take care of yourslave, or you may want them long.  Voe capiti tuo--vengeance on thyhead, wretched one!\'\'What is this?\' said the hag, looking from one to the other.Nydia started as by a sudden impulse from the wall against which she hadleaned: she threw herself at the feet of Stratonice; she embraced herknees, and looking up at her with those sightless but touching eyes:\'O my mistress!\' sobbed she, \'you are a woman--you have had sisters--youhave been young like me, feel for me--save me!  I will go to thosehorrible feasts no more!\'\'Stuff!\' said the hag, dragging her up rudely by one of those delicatehands, fit for no harsher labor than that of weaving the flowers whichmade her pleasure or her trade; \'stuff! these fine scruples are not forslaves.\'\'Hark ye,\' said Burbo, drawing forth his purse, and chinking itscontents: \'you hear this music, wife; by Pollux! if you do not break inyon colt with a tight rein, you will hear it no more.\'\'The girl is tired,\' said Stratonice, nodding to Calenus; \'she will bemore docile when you next want her.\'\'You! you! who is here?\' cried Nydia, casting her eyes round theapartment with so fearful and straining a survey, that Calenus rose inalarm from his seat.\'She must see with those eyes!\' muttered he.\'Who is here!  Speak, in heaven\'s name!  Ah, if you were blind like me,you would be less cruel,\' said she; and she again burst into tears.\'Take her away,\' said Burbo, impatiently; \'I hate these whimperings.\'\'Come!\' said Stratonice, pushing the poor child by the shoulders.  Nydiadrew herself aside, with an air to which resolution gave dignity.\'Hear me,\' she said; \'I have served you faithfully--I who was broughtup--Ah! my mother, my poor mother! didst thou dream I should come tothis?\' She dashed the tear from her eyes, and proceeded: \'Command me inaught else, and I will obey; but I tell you now, hard, stern, inexorableas you are--I tell you that I will go there no more; or, if I am forcedthere, that I will implore the mercy of the praetor himself--I have saidit.  Hear me, ye gods, I swear!\'The hag\'s eyes glowed with fire; she seized the child by the hair withone hand, and raised on high the other--that formidable right hand, theleast blow of which seemed capable to crush the frail and delicate formthat trembled in her grasp.  That thought itself appeared to strike her,for she suspended the blow, changed her purpose, and dragging Nydia tothe wall, seized from a hook a rope, often, alas! applied to a similarpurpose, and the next moment the shrill, the agonized shrieks of theblind girl, rang piercingly through the house.Chapter IIIGLAUCUS MAKES A PURCHASE THAT AFTERWARDS COSTS HIM DEAR.\'HOLLA, my brave fellows!\' said Lepidus, stooping his head as he enteredthe low doorway of the house of Burbo.  \'We have come to see which ofyou most honors your lanista.\' The gladiators rose from the table inrespect to three gallants known to be among the gayest and richestyouths of Pompeii, and whose voices were therefore the dispensers ofamphitheatrical reputation.\'What fine animals!\' said Clodius to Glaucus: \'worthy to be gladiators!\'\'It is a pity they are not warriors,\' returned Glaucus.A singular thing it was to see the dainty and fastidious Lepidus, whomin a banquet a ray of daylight seemed to blind--whom in the bath abreeze of air seemed to blast--in whom Nature seemed twisted andperverted from every natural impulse, and curdled into one dubious thingof effeminacy and art--a singular thing was it to see this Lepidus, nowall eagerness, and energy, and life, patting the vast shoulders of thegladiators with a blanched and girlish hand, feeling with a mincinggripe their great brawn and iron muscles, all lost in calculatingadmiration at that manhood which he had spent his life in carefullybanishing from himself.So have we seen at this day the beardless flutterers of the saloons ofLondon thronging round the heroes of the Fives-court--so have we seenthem admire, and gaze, and calculate a bet--so have we seen them meettogether, in ludicrous yet in melancholy assemblage, the two extremes ofcivilized society--the patrons of pleasure and its slaves--vilest of allslaves--at once ferocious and mercenary; male prostitutes, who selltheir strength as women their beauty; beasts in act, but baser thanbeasts in motive, for the last, at least, do not mangle themselves formoney!\'Ha! Niger, how will you fight?\' said Lepidus: \'and with whom?\'\'Sporus challenges me,\' said the grim giant; \'we shall fight to thedeath, I hope.\'\'Ah! to be sure,\' grunted Sporus, with a twinkle of his small eye.\'He takes the sword, I the net and the trident: it will be rare sport. Ihope the survivor will have enough to keep up the dignity of the crown.\'\'Never fear, we\'ll fill the purse, my Hector,\' said Clodius:\'let me see--you fight against Niger?  Glaucus, a bet--I back Niger.\'\'I told you so,\' cried Niger exultingly.  \'The noble Clodius knows me;count yourself dead already, my Sporus.\'Clodius took out his tablet.  \'A bet--ten sestertia.  What say you?\'\'So be it,\' said Glaucus.  \'But whom have we here?  I never saw thishero before\'; and he glanced at Lydon, whose limbs were slighter thanthose of his companions, and who had something of grace, and somethingeven of nobleness, in his face, which his profession had not yet whollydestroyed.\'It is Lydon, a youngster, practised only with the wooden sword as yet,\'answered Niger, condescendingly.  \'But he has the true blood in him, andhas challenged Tetraides.\'\'He challenged me,\' said Lydon: \'I accept the offer.\'\'And how do you fight?\' asked Lepidus.  \'Chut, my boy, wait a whilebefore you contend with Tetraides.\' Lydon smiled disdainfully.\'Is he a citizen or a slave?\' said Clodius.\'A citizen--we are all citizens here,\' quoth Niger.\'Stretch out your arm, my Lydon,\' said Lepidus, with the air of aconnoisseur.The gladiator, with a significant glance at his companions, extended anarm which, if not so huge in its girth as those of his comrades, was sofirm in its muscles, so beautifully symmetrical in its proportions, thatthe three visitors uttered simultaneously an admiring exclamation.\'Well, man, what is your weapon?\' said Clodius, tablet in hand.\'We are to fight first with the cestus; afterwards, if both survive,with swords,\' returned Tetraides, sharply, and with an envious scowl.\'With the cestus!\' cried Glaucus; \'there you are wrong, Lydon; thecestus is the Greek fashion: I know it well.  You should have encouragedflesh for that contest: you are far too thin for it--avoid the cestus.\'\'I cannot,\' said Lydon.\'And why?\'\'I have said--because he has challenged me.\'\'But he will not hold you to the precise weapon.\'\'My honour holds me!\' returned Lydon, proudly.\'I bet on Tetraides, two to one, at the cestus,\' said Clodius; shall itbe, Lepidus?--even betting, with swords.\'\'If you give me three to one, I will not take the odds, said Lepidus:\'Lydon will never come to the swords.  You are mighty courteous.\'\'What say you, Glaucus?\' said Clodius.\'I will take the odds three to one.\'\'Ten sestertia to thirty.\'\'Yes.\'Clodius wrote the bet in his book.\'Pardon me, noble sponsor mine,\' said Lydon, in a low voice to Glaucus:\'but how much think you the victor will gain?\'\'How much? why, perhaps seven sestertia.\'\'You are sure it will be as much?\'\'At least.  But out on you!--a Greek would have thought of the honour,and not the money.  O Italians! everywhere ye are Italians!\'A blush mantled over the bronzed cheek of the gladiator.\'Do not wrong me, noble Glaucus; I think of both, but I should neverhave been a gladiator but for the money.\'\'Base! mayest thou fall!  A miser never was a hero.\'\'I am not a miser,\' said Lydon, haughtily, and he withdrew to the otherend of the room.\'But I don\'t see Burbo; where is Burbo?  I must talk with Burbo,\' criedClodius.\'He is within,\' said Niger, pointing to the door at the extremity of theroom.\'And Stratonice, the brave old lass, where is she?\' quoth Lepidus.\'Why, she was here just before you entered; but she heard something thatdispleased her yonder, and vanished.  Pollux! old Burbo had perhapscaught hold of some girl in the back room.  I heard a female\'s voicecrying out; the old dame is as jealous as Juno.\'\'Ho! excellent!\' cried Lepidus, laughing.  \'Come, Clodius, let us goshares with Jupiter; perhaps he has caught a Leda.\'At this moment a loud cry of pain and terror startled the group.\'Oh, spare me! spare me!  I am but a child, I am blind--is not thatpunishment enough?\'\'O Pallas!  I know that voice, it is my poor flower-girl!\' exclaimedGlaucus, and he darted at once into the quarter whence the cry rose.He burst the door; he beheld Nydia writhing in the grasp of theinfuriate hag; the cord, already dabbled with blood, was raised in theair--it was suddenly arrested.\'Fury!\' said Glaucus, and with his left hand he caught Nydia from hergrasp; \'how dare you use thus a girl--one of your own sex, a child!  MyNydia, my poor infant!\'\'Oh? is that you--is that Glaucus?\' exclaimed the flower-girl, in a tonealmost of transport; the tears stood arrested on her cheek; she smiled,she clung to his breast, she kissed his robe as she clung.\'And how dare you, pert stranger! interfere between a free woman and herslave.  By the gods! despite your fine tunic and your filthy perfumes, Idoubt whether you are even a Roman citizen, my mannikin.\'\'Fair words, mistress--fair words!\' said Clodius, now entering withLepidus. \'This is my friend and sworn brother; he must be put undershelter of your tongue, sweet one; it rains stones!\'\'Give me my slave!\' shrieked the virago, placing her mighty grasp on thebreast of the Greek.\'Not if all your sister Furies could help you,\' answered Glaucus.  \'Fearnot, sweet Nydia; an Athenian never forsook distress!\'\'Holla!\' said Burbo, rising reluctantly, \'What turmoil is all this abouta slave?  Let go the young gentleman, wife--let him go: for his sake thepert thing shall be spared this once.\' So saying, he drew, or ratherdragged off, his ferocious help-mate.\'Methought when we entered,\' said Clodius, \'there was another manpresent?\'\'He is gone.\'For the priest of Isis had indeed thought it high time to vanish.\'Oh, a friend of mine! a brother cupman, a quiet dog, who does not lovethese snarlings,\' said Burbo, carelessly.  \'But go, child, you will tearthe gentleman\'s tunic if you cling to him so tight; go, you arepardoned.\'\'Oh, do not--do not forsake me!\' cried Nydia, clinging yet closer to theAthenian.Moved by her forlorn situation, her appeal to him, her own innumerableand touching graces, the Greek seated himself on one of the rude chairs.He held her on his knees--he wiped the blood from her shoulders with hislong hair--he kissed the tears from her cheeks--he whispered to her athousand of those soothing words with which we calm the grief of achild--and so beautiful did he seem in his gentle and consoling task,that even the fierce heart of Stratonice was touched.  His presenceseemed to shed light over that base and obscene haunt--young, beautiful,glorious, he was the emblem of all that earth made most happy,comforting one that earth had abandoned!\'Well, who could have thought our blind Nydia had been so honored!\' saidthe virago, wiping her heated brow.Glaucus looked up at Burbo.\'My good man,\' said he, \'this is your slave; she sings well, she isaccustomed to the care of flowers--I wish to make a present of such aslave to a lady.  Will you sell her to me?\' As he spoke he felt thewhole frame of the poor girl tremble with delight; she started up, sheput her disheveled hair from her eyes, she looked around, as if, alas,she had the power to see!\'Sell our Nydia! no, indeed,\' said Stratonice, gruffly.Nydia sank back with a long sigh, and again clasped the robe of herprotector.\'Nonsense!\' said Clodius, imperiously: \'you must oblige me. What, man!what, old dame! offend me, and your trade is ruined.  Is not Burbo mykinsman Pansa\'s client?  Am I not the oracle of the amphitheatre and itsheroes?  If I say the word, break up your wine-jars--you sell no more.Glaucus, the slave is yours.\'Burbo scratched his huge head, in evident embarrassment.\'The girl is worth her weight in gold to me.\'\'Name your price, I am rich,\' said Glaucus.The ancient Italians were like the modern, there was nothing they wouldnot sell, much less a poor blind girl.\'I paid six sestertia for her, she is worth twelve now,\' mutteredStratonice.\'You shall have twenty; come to the magistrates at once, and then to myhouse for your money.\'\'I would not have sold the dear girl for a hundred but to oblige nobleClodius,\' said Burbo, whiningly.  \'And you will speak to Pansa about theplace of designator at the amphitheatre, noble Clodius? it would justsuit me.\'\'Thou shalt have it,\' said Clodius; adding in a whisper to Burbo, \'YonGreek can make your fortune; money runs through him like a sieve: markto-day with white chalk, my Priam.\'\'An dabis?\' said Glaucus, in the formal question of sale and barter.\'Dabitur,\' answered Burbo.\'Then, then, I am to go with you--with you?  O happiness!\' murmuredNydia.\'Pretty one, yes; and thy hardest task henceforth shall be to sing thyGrecian hymns to the loveliest lady in Pompeii.\'The girl sprang from his clasp; a change came over her whole face,bright the instant before; she sighed heavily, and then once more takinghis hand, she said:\'I thought I was to go to your house?\'\'And so thou shalt for the present; come, we lose time.\'Chapter IVTHE RIVAL OF GLAUCUS PRESSES ONWARD IN THE RACE.IONE was one of those brilliant characters which, but once or twice,flash across our career.  She united in the highest perfection therarest of earthly gifts--Genius and Beauty.  No one ever possessedsuperior intellectual qualities without knowing them--the alliterationof modesty and merit is pretty enough, but where merit is great, theveil of that modesty you admire never disguises its extent from itspossessor.  It is the proud consciousness of certain qualities that itcannot reveal to the everyday world, that gives to genius that shy, andreserved, and troubled air, which puzzles and flatters you when youencounter it.Ione, then, knew her genius; but, with that charming versatility thatbelongs of right to women, she had the faculty so few of a kindredgenius in the less malleable sex can claim--the faculty to bend andmodel her graceful intellect to all whom it encountered. The sparklingfountain threw its waters alike upon the strand, the cavern, and theflowers; it refreshed, it smiled, it dazzled everywhere.  That pride,which is the necessary result of superiority, she wore easily--in herbreast it concentred itself in independence.  She pursued thus her ownbright and solitary path.  She asked no aged matron to direct and guideher--she walked alone by the torch of her own unflickering purity.  Sheobeyed no tyrannical and absolute custom.  She moulded custom to her ownwill, but this so delicately and with so feminine a grace, so perfect anexemption from error, that you could not say she outraged custom butcommanded it.  The wealth of her graces was inexhaustible--shebeautified the commonest action; a word, a look from her, seemed magic.Love her, and you entered into a new world, you passed from this triteand commonplace earth.  You were in a land in which your eyes saweverything through an enchanted medium.  In her presence you felt as iflistening to exquisite music; you were steeped in that sentiment whichhas so little of earth in it, and which music so well inspires--thatintoxication which refines and exalts, which seizes, it is true, thesenses, but gives them the character of the soul.She was peculiarly formed, then, to command and fascinate the lessordinary and the bolder natures of men; to love her was to unite twopassions, that of love and of ambition--you aspired when you adored her.It was no wonder that she had completely chained and subdued themysterious but burning soul of the Egyptian, a man in whom dwelt thefiercest passions.  Her beauty and her soul alike enthralled him.Set apart himself from the common world, he loved that daringness ofcharacter which also made itself, among common things, aloof and alone.He did not, or he would not see, that that very isolation put her yetmore from him than from the vulgar.  Far as the poles--far as the nightfrom day, his solitude was divided from hers.  He was solitary from hisdark and solemn vices--she from her beautiful fancies and her purity ofvirtue.If it was not strange that Ione thus enthralled the Egyptian, far lessstrange was it that she had captured, as suddenly as irrevocably,  thebright and sunny heart of the Athenian.  The gladness of a temperamentwhich seemed woven from the beams of light had led Glaucus intopleasure.  He obeyed no more vicious dictates when he wandered into thedissipations of his time, than the exhilarating voices of youth andhealth.  He threw the brightness of his nature over every abyss andcavern through which he strayed.  His imagination dazzled him, but hisheart never was corrupted. Of far more penetration than his companionsdeemed, he saw that they sought to prey upon his riches and his youth:but he despised wealth save as the means of enjoyment, and youth was thegreat sympathy that united him to them.  He felt, it is true, theimpulse of nobler thoughts and higher aims than in pleasure could beindulged: but the world was one vast prison, to which the Sovereign ofRome was the Imperial gaoler; and the very virtues, which in the freedays of Athens would have made him ambitious, in the slavery of earthmade him inactive and supine.  For in that unnatural and bloatedcivilization, all that was noble in emulation was forbidden. Ambition inthe regions of a despotic and luxurious court was but the contest offlattery and craft.  Avarice had become the sole ambition--men desiredpraetorships and provinces only as the license to pillage, andgovernment was but the excuse of rapine.  It is in small states thatglory is most active and pure--the more confined the limits of thecircle, the more ardent the patriotism.  In small states, opinion isconcentrated and strong--every eye reads your actions--your publicmotives are blended with your private ties--every spot in your narrowsphere is crowded with forms familiar since your childhood--the applauseof your citizens is like the caresses of your friends.  But in largestates, the city is but the court: the provinces--unknown to you,unfamiliar in customs, perhaps in language--have no claim on yourpatriotism, the ancestry of their inhabitants is not yours.  In thecourt you desire favor instead of glory; at a distance from the court,public opinion has vanished from you, and self-interest has nocounterpoise.Italy, Italy, while I write, your skies are over me--your seas flowbeneath my feet, listen not to the blind policy which would unite allyour crested cities, mourning for their republics, into one empire;false, pernicious delusion! your only hope of regeneration is indivision.  Florence, Milan, Venice, Genoa, may be free once more, ifeach is free.  But dream not of freedom for the whole while you enslavethe parts; the heart must be the centre of the system, the blood mustcirculate freely everywhere; and in vast communities you behold but abloated and feeble giant, whose brain is imbecile, whose limbs are dead,and who pays in disease and weakness the penalty of transcending thenatural proportions of health and vigour.Thus thrown back upon themselves, the more ardent qualities of Glaucusfound no vent, save in that overflowing imagination which gave grace topleasure, and poetry to thought.  Ease was less despicable thancontention with parasites and slaves, and luxury could yet be refinedthough ambition could not be ennobled.  But all that was best andbrightest in his soul woke at once when he knew Ione.  Here was anempire, worthy of demigods to attain; here was a glory, which thereeking smoke of a foul society could not soil or dim.  Love, in everytime, in every state, can thus find space for its golden altars. Andtell me if there ever, even in the ages most favorable to glory, couldbe a triumph more exalted and elating than the conquest of one nobleheart?And whether it was that this sentiment inspired him, his ideas glowedmore brightly, his soul seemed more awake and more visible, in Ione\'spresence. If natural to love her, it was natural that she should returnthe passion. Young, brilliant, eloquent, enamoured, and Athenian, he wasto her as the incarnation of the poetry of her father\'s land.  They werenot like creatures of a world in which strife and sorrow are theelements; they were like things to be seen only in the holiday ofnature, so glorious and so fresh were their youth, their beauty, andtheir love.  They seemed out of place in the harsh and every-day earth;they belonged of right to the Saturnian age, and the dreams of demigodand nymph.  It was as if the poetry of life gathered and fed itself inthem, and in their hearts were concentrated the last rays of the sun ofDelos and of Greece.But if Ione was independent in her choice of life, so was her modestpride proportionably vigilant and easily alarmed.  The falsehood of theEgyptian was invented by a deep knowledge of her nature.  The story ofcoarseness, of indelicacy, in Glaucus, stung her to the quick.  She feltit a reproach upon her character and her career, a punishment above allto her love; she felt, for the first time, how suddenly she had yieldedto that love; she blushed with shame at a weakness, the extent of whichshe was startled to perceive: she imagined it was that weakness whichhad incurred the contempt of Glaucus; she endured the bitterest curse ofnoble natures--humiliation!  Yet her love, perhaps, was no less alarmedthan her pride.  If one moment she murmured reproaches upon Glaucus--ifone moment she renounced, she almost hated him--at the next she burstinto passionate tears, her heart yielded to its softness, and she saidin the bitterness of anguish, \'He despises me--he does not love me.\'From the hour the Egyptian had left her she had retired to her mostsecluded chamber, she had shut out her handmaids, she had denied herselfto the crowds that besieged her door.  Glaucus was excluded with therest; he wondered, but he guessed not why!  He never attributed to hisIone--his queen--his goddess--that woman-like caprice of which thelove-poets of Italy so unceasingly complain.  He imagined her, in themajesty of her candour, above all the arts that torture.  He wastroubled, but his hopes were not dimmed, for he knew already that heloved and was beloved; what more could he desire as an amulet againstfear?At deepest night, then, when the streets were hushed, and the high moononly beheld his devotions, he stole to that temple of his heart--herhome; and wooed her after the beautiful fashion of his country.  Hecovered her threshold with the richest garlands, in which every flowerwas a volume of sweet passion; and he charmed the long summer night withthe sound of the Lydian lute: and verses, which the inspiration of themoment sufficed to weave.But the window above opened not; no smile made yet more holy the shiningair of night.  All was still and dark.  He knew not if his verse waswelcome and his suit was heard.Yet Ione slept not, nor disdained to hear.  Those soft strains ascendedto her chamber; they soothed, they subdued her.  While she listened, shebelieved nothing against her lover; but when they were stilled at last,and his step departed, the spell ceased; and, in the bitterness of hersoul, she almost conceived in that delicate flattery a new affront.I said she was denied to all; but there was one exception, there was oneperson who would not be denied, assuming over her actions and her housesomething like the authority of a parent; Arbaces, for himself, claimedan exemption from all the ceremonies observed by others.  He entered thethreshold with the license of one who feels that he is privileged and athome.  He made his way to her solitude and with that sort of quiet andunapologetic air which seemed to consider the right as a thing ofcourse. With all the independence of Ione\'s character, his heart hadenabled him to obtain a secret and powerful control over her mind.  Shecould not shake it off; sometimes she desired to do so; but she neveractively struggled against it.  She was fascinated by his serpent eye.He arrested, he commanded her, by the magic of a mind long accustomed toawe and to subdue. Utterly unaware of his real character or his hiddenlove, she felt for him the reverence which genius feels for wisdom, andvirtue for sanctity.  She regarded him as one of those mighty sages ofold, who attained to the mysteries of knowledge by an exemption from thepassions of their kind.  She scarcely considered him as a being, likeherself, of the earth, but as an oracle at once dark and sacred.  Shedid not love him, but she feared.  His presence was unwelcome to her; itdimmed her spirit even in its brightest mood; he seemed, with hischilling and lofty aspect, like some eminence which casts a shadow overthe sun.  But she never thought of forbidding his visits.  She waspassive under the influence which created in her breast, not therepugnance, but something of the stillness of terror.Arbaces himself now resolved to exert all his arts to possess himself ofthat treasure he so burningly coveted.  He was cheered and elated by hisconquests over her brother.  From the hour in which Apaecides fellbeneath the voluptuous sorcery of that fete which we have described, hefelt his empire over the young priest triumphant and insured.  He knewthat there is no victim so thoroughly subdued as a young and fervent manfor the first time delivered to the thraldom of the senses.When Apaecides recovered, with the morning light, from the profoundsleep which succeeded to the delirium of wonder and of pleasure, he was,it is true, ashamed--terrified--appalled.  His vows of austerity andcelibacy echoed in his ear; his thirst after holiness--had it beenquenched at so unhallowed a stream?  But Arbaces knew well the means bywhich to confirm his conquest.  From the arts of pleasure he led theyoung priest at once to those of his mysterious wisdom.  He bared to hisamazed eyes the initiatory secrets of the sombre philosophy of theNile--those secrets plucked from the stars, and the wild chemistry,which, in those days, when Reason herself was but the creature ofImagination, might well pass for the lore of a diviner magic.  He seemedto the young eyes of the priest as a being above mortality, and endowedwith supernatural gifts.  That yearning and intense desire for theknowledge which is not of earth--which had burned from his boyhood inthe heart of the priest--was dazzled, until it confused and mastered hisclearer sense. He gave himself to the art which thus addressed at oncethe two strongest of human passions, that of pleasure and that ofknowledge. He was loth to believe that one so wise could err, that oneso lofty could stoop to deceive.  Entangled in the dark web ofmetaphysical moralities, he caught at the excuse by which the Egyptianconverted vice into a virtue.  His pride was insensibly flattered thatArbaces had deigned to rank him with himself, to set him apart from thelaws which bound the vulgar, to make him an august participator, both inthe mystic studies and the magic fascinations of the Egyptian\'ssolitude.  The pure and stern lessons of that creed to which Olinthushad sought to make him convert, were swept away from his memory by thedeluge of new passions. And the Egyptian, who was versed in the articlesof that true faith, and who soon learned from his pupil the effect whichhad been produced upon him by its believers, sought, not unskilfully, toundo that effect, by a tone of reasoning, half-sarcastic andhalf-earnest.\'This faith,\' said he, \'is but a borrowed plagiarism from one of themany allegories invented by our priests of old.  Observe,\' he added,pointing to a hieroglyphical scroll--\'observe in these ancient figuresthe origin of the Christian\'s Trinity.  Here are also three gods--theDeity, the Spirit, and the Son.  Observe, that the epithet of the Son is""Saviour""--observe, that the sign by which his human qualities aredenoted is the cross.\' Note here, too, the mystic history of Osiris, howhe put on death; how he lay in the grave; and how, thus fulfilling asolemn atonement, he rose again from the dead!  In these stories we butdesign to paint an allegory from the operations of nature and theevolutions of the eternal heavens.  But the allegory unknown, the typesthemselves have furnished to credulous nations the materials of manycreeds.  They have travelled to the vast plains of India; they havemixed themselves up in the visionary speculations of the Greek; becomingmore and more gross and embodied, as they emerge farther from theshadows of their antique origin, they have assumed a human and palpableform in this novel faith; and the believers of Galilee are but theunconscious repeaters of one of the superstitions of the Nile!\'This was the last argument which completely subdued the priest.  It wasnecessary to him, as to all, to believe in something; and undivided and,at last, unreluctant, he surrendered himself to that belief whichArbaces inculcated, and which all that was human in passion--all thatwas flattering in vanity--all that was alluring in pleasure, served toinvite to, and contributed to confirm.This conquest, thus easily made, the Egyptian could now give himselfwholly up to the pursuit of a far dearer and mightier object; and hehailed, in his success with the brother, an omen of his triumph over thesister.He had seen Ione on the day following the revel we have witnessed; andwhich was also the day after he had poisoned her mind against his rival.The next day, and the next, he saw her also: and each time he laidhimself out with consummate art, partly to confirm her impressionagainst Glaucus, and principally to prepare her for the impressions hedesired her to receive. The proud Ione took care to conceal the anguishshe endured; and the pride of woman has an hypocrisy which can deceivethe most penetrating, and shame the most astute.  But Arbaces was noless cautious not to recur to a subject which he felt it was mostpolitic to treat as of the lightest importance. He knew that by dwellingmuch upon the fault of a rival, you only give him dignity in the eyes ofyour mistress: the wisest plan is, neither loudly to hate, nor bitterlyto contemn; the wisest plan is to lower him by an indifference of tone,as if you could not dream that he could be loved. Your safety is inconcealing the wound to your own pride, and imperceptibly alarming thatof the umpire, whose voice is fate!  Such, in all times, will be thepolicy of one who knows the science of the sex--it was now theEgyptian\'s.He recurred no more, then, to the presumption of Glaucus; he mentionedhis name, but not more often than that of Clodius or of Lepidus.  Heaffected to class them together as things of a low and ephemeralspecies; as things wanting nothing of the butterfly, save its innocenceand its grace. Sometimes he slightly alluded to some invented debauch,in which he declared them companions; sometimes he adverted to them asthe antipodes of those lofty and spiritual natures, to whose order thatof Ione belonged.  Blinded alike by the pride of Ione, and, perhaps, byhis own, he dreamed not that she already loved; but he dreaded lest shemight have formed for Glaucus the first fluttering prepossessions thatlead to love.  And, secretly, he ground his teeth in rage and jealousy,when he reflected on the youth, the fascinations, and the brilliancy ofthat formidable rival whom he pretended to undervalue.It was on the fourth day from the date of the close of the previousbook, that Arbaces and Ione sat together.\'You wear your veil at home,\' said the Egyptian; \'that is not fair tothose whom you honour with your friendship.\'\'But to Arbaces,\' answered Ione, who, indeed, had cast the veil over herfeatures to conceal eyes red with weeping--\'to Arbaces, who looks onlyto the mind, what matters it that the face is concealed?\'\'I do look only to the mind,\' replied the Egyptian: \'show me then yourface--for there I shall see it.\'\'You grow gallant in the air of Pompeii,\' said Ione, with a forced toneof gaiety.\'Do you think, fair Ione, that it is only at Pompeii that I have learnedto value you?\' The Egyptian\'s voice trembled--he paused for a moment,and then resumed.\'There is a love, beautiful Greek, which is not the love only of thethoughtless and the young--there is a love which sees not with the eyes,which hears not with the ears; but in which soul is enamoured of soul.The countryman of thy ancestors, the cave-nursed Plato, dreamed of sucha love--his followers have sought to imitate it; but it is a love thatis not for the herd to echo--it is a love that only high and noblenatures can conceive--it hath nothing in common with the sympathies andties of coarse affection--wrinkles do not revolt it--homeliness offeature does not deter; it asks youth, it is true, but it asks it onlyin the freshness of the emotions; it asks beauty, it is true, but it isthe beauty of the thought and of the spirit.  Such is the love, O Ione,which is a worthy offering to thee from the cold and the austere.Austere and cold thou deemest me--such is the love that I venture to layupon thy shrine--thou canst receive it without a blush.\'\'And its name is friendship!\' replied Ione: her answer was innocent, yetit sounded like the reproof of one conscious of the design of thespeaker.\'Friendship!\' said Arbaces, vehemently.  \'No; that is a word too oftenprofaned to apply to a sentiment so sacred.  Friendship! it is a tiethat binds fools and profligates! Friendship! it is the bond that unitesthe frivolous hearts of a Glaucus and a Clodius! Friendship! no, that isan affection of earth, of vulgar habits and sordid sympathies; thefeeling of which I speak is borrowed from the stars\'--it partakes ofthat mystic and ineffable yearning, which we feel when we gaze onthem--it burns, yet it purifies--it is the lamp of naphtha in thealabaster vase, glowing with fragrant odorous, but shining only throughthe purest vessels.  No; it is not love, and it is not friendship, thatArbaces feels for Ione.  Give it no name--earth has no name for it--itis not of earth--why debase it with earthly epithets and earthlyassociations?\'Never before had Arbaces ventured so far, yet he felt his ground step bystep: he knew that he uttered a language which, if at this day ofaffected platonisms it would speak unequivocally to the ears of beauty,was at that time strange and unfamiliar, to which no precise idea couldbe attached, from which he could imperceptibly advance or recede, asoccasion suited, as hope encouraged or fear deterred. Ione trembled,though she knew not why; her veil hid her features, and masked anexpression, which, if seen by the Egyptian, would have at once dampedand enraged him; in fact, he never was more displeasing to her--theharmonious modulation of the most suasive voice that ever disguisedunhallowed thought fell discordantly on her ear.  Her whole soul wasstill filled with the image of Glaucus; and the accent of tendernessfrom another only revolted and dismayed; yet she did not conceive thatany passion more ardent than that platonism which Arbaces expressedlurked beneath his words.  She thought that he, in truth, spoke only ofthe affection and sympathy of the soul; but was it not precisely thataffection and that sympathy which had made a part of those emotions shefelt for Glaucus; and could any other footstep than his approach thehaunted adytum of her heart?Anxious at once to change the conversation, she replied, therefore, witha cold and indifferent voice, \'Whomsoever Arbaces honors with thesentiment of esteem, it is natural that his elevated wisdom should colorthat sentiment with its own hues; it is natural that his friendshipshould be purer than that of others, whose pursuits and errors he doesnot deign to share.  But tell me, Arbaces, hast thou seen my brother oflate?  He has not visited me for several days; and when I last saw himhis manner disturbed and alarmed me much.  I fear lest he was tooprecipitate in the severe choice that he has adopted, and that herepents an irrevocable step.\'\'Be cheered, Ione,\' replied the Egyptian.  \'It is true that, some littletime since he was troubled and sad of spirit; those doubts beset himwhich were likely to haunt one of that fervent temperament, which everebbs and flows, and vibrates between excitement and exhaustion.  But he,Ione, he came to me his anxieties and his distress; he sought one whopitied me and loved him; I have calmed his mind--I have removed hisdoubts--I have taken him from the threshold of Wisdom into its temple;and before the majesty of the goddess his soul is hushed and soothed.Fear not, he will repent no more; they who trust themselves to Arbacesnever repent but for a moment.\'\'You rejoice me,\' answered Ione.  \'My dear brother! in his contentment Iam happy.\'The conversation then turned upon lighter subjects; the Egyptian exertedhimself to please, he condescended even to entertain; the vast varietyof his knowledge enabled him to adorn and light up every subject onwhich he touched; and Ione, forgetting the displeasing effect of hisformer words, was carried away, despite her sadness, by the magic of hisintellect.  Her manner became unrestrained and her language fluent; andArbaces, who had waited his opportunity, now hastened to seize it.\'You have never seen,\' said he, \'the interior of my home; it may amuseyou to do so: it contains some rooms that may explain to you what youhave often asked me to describe--the fashion of an Egyptian house; notindeed, that you will perceive in the poor and minute proportions ofRoman architecture the massive strength, the vast space, the giganticmagnificence, or even the domestic construction of the palaces of Thebesand Memphis; but something there is, here and there, that may serve toexpress to you some notion of that antique civilization which hashumanized the world.  Devote, then, to the austere friend of your youth,one of these bright summer evenings, and let me boast that my gloomymansion has been honored with the presence of the admired Ione.\'Unconscious of the pollutions of the mansion, of the danger that awaitedher, Ione readily assented to the proposal.  The next evening was fixedfor the visit; and the Egyptian, with a serene countenance, and a heartbeating with fierce and unholy joy, departed. Scarce had he gone, whenanother visitor claimed admission....  But now we return to Glaucus.Chapter VTHE POOR TORTOISE.  NEW CHANGES FOR NYDIA.THE morning sun shone over the small and odorous garden enclosed withinthe peristyle of the house of the Athenian.  He lay reclined, sad andlistlessly, on the smooth grass which intersected the viridarium; and aslight canopy stretched above, broke the fierce rays of the summer sun.When that fairy mansion was first disinterred from the earth they foundin the garden the shell of a tortoise that had been its inmate.  Thatanimal, so strange a link in the creation, to which Nature seems to havedenied all the pleasure of life, save life\'s passive and dream-likeperception, had been the guest of the place for years before Glaucuspurchased it; for years, indeed which went beyond the memory of man, andto which tradition assigned an almost incredible date.  The househad been built and rebuilt--its possessors had changed andfluctuated--generations had flourished and decayed--and still thetortoise dragged on its slow and unsympathizing existence.  In theearthquake, which sixteen years before had overthrown many of the publicbuildings of the city, and scared away the amazed inhabitants, the housenow inhabited by Glaucus had been terribly shattered.  The possessorsdeserted it for many days; on their return they cleared away the ruinswhich encumbered the viridarium, and found still the tortoise, unharmedand unconscious of the surrounding destruction.  It seemed to bear acharmed life in its languid blood and imperceptible motions; yet it wasnot so inactive as it seemed: it held a regular and monotonous course;inch by inch it traversed the little orbit of its domain, taking monthsto accomplish the whole gyration.  It was a restless voyager, thattortoise!--patiently, and with pain, did it perform its self-appointedjourneys, evincing no interest in the things around it--a philosopherconcentrated in itself.  There was something grand in its solitaryselfishness!--the sun in which it basked--the waters poured daily overit--the air, which it insensibly inhaled, were its sole and unfailingluxuries.  The mild changes of the season, in that lovely clime,affected it not.  It covered itself with its shell--as the saint in hispiety--as the sage in his wisdom--as the lover in his hope.It was impervious to the shocks and mutations of time--it was an emblemof time itself: slow, regular, perpetual; unwitting of the passions thatfret themselves around--of the wear and tear of mortality.  The poortortoise! nothing less than the bursting of volcanoes, the convulsionsof the riven world, could have quenched its sluggish spark!  Theinexorable Death, that spared not pomp or beauty, passed unheedingly bya thing to which death could bring so insignificant a change.For this animal the mercurial and vivid Greek felt all the wonder andaffection of contrast.  He could spend hours in surveying its creepingprogress, in moralizing over its mechanism.  He despised it in joy--heenvied it in sorrow.Regarding it now as he lay along the sward--its dull mass moving whileit seemed motionless, the Athenian murmured to himself:\'The eagle dropped a stone from his talons, thinking to break thy shell:the stone crushed the head of a poet.  This is the allegory of Fate!Dull thing!  Thou hadst a father and a mother; perhaps, ages ago, thouthyself hadst a mate.  Did thy parents love, or didst thou?  Did thyslow blood circulate more gladly when thou didst creep to the side ofthy wedded one? Wert thou capable of affection? Could it distress theeif she were away from thy side?  Couldst thou feel when she was present?What would I not give to know the history of thy mailed breast--to gazeupon the mechanism of thy faint desires--to mark what hair-breadthdifference separates thy sorrow from thy joy!  Yet, methinks, thouwouldst know if Ione were present!  Thou wouldst feel her coming like ahappier air--like a gladder sun.  I envy thee now, for thou knowest notthat she is absent; and I--would I could be like thee--between theintervals of seeing her!  What doubt, what presentiment, haunts me! whywill she not admit me?  Days have passed since I heard her voice.  Forthe first time, life grows flat to me.  I am as one who is left alone ata banquet, the lights dead, and the flowers faded.  Ah! Ione, couldstthou dream how I adore thee!\'From these enamoured reveries, Glaucus was interrupted by the entranceof Nydia.  She came with her light, though cautious step, along themarble tablinum.  She passed the portico, and paused at the flowerswhich bordered the garden.  She had her water-vase in her hand, and shesprinkled the thirsting plants, which seemed to brighten at herapproach.  She bent to inhale their odor.  She touched them timidly andcaressingly.  She felt, along their stems, if any withered leaf orcreeping insect marred their beauty.  And as she hovered from flower toflower, with her earnest and youthful countenance and graceful motions,you could not have imagined a fitter handmaid for the goddess of thegarden.\'Nydia, my child!\' said Glaucus.At the sound of his voice she paused at once--listening, blushing,breathless; with her lips parted, her face upturned to catch thedirection of the sound, she laid down the vase--she hastened to him; andwonderful it was to see how unerringly she threaded her dark way throughthe flowers, and came by the shortest path to the side of her new lord.\'Nydia,\' said Glaucus, tenderly stroking back her long and beautifulhair, \'it is now three days since thou hast been under the protection ofmy household gods.  Have they smiled on thee?  Art thou happy?\'\'Ah! so happy!\' sighed the slave.\'And now,\' continued Glaucus, \'that thou hast recovered somewhat fromthe hateful recollections of thy former state,--and now that they havefitted thee (touching her broidered tunic) with garments more meet forthy delicate shape--and now, sweet child, that thou hast accustomedthyself to a happiness, which may the gods grant thee ever! I am aboutto pray at thy hands a boon.\'\'Oh! what can I do for thee?\' said Nydia, clasping her hands.\'Listen,\' said Glaucus, \'and young as thou art, thou shalt be myconfidant. Hast thou ever heard the name of Ione?\'The blind girl gasped for breath, and turning pale as one of the statueswhich shone upon them from the peristyle, she answered with an effort,and after a moment\'s pause:\'Yes!  I have heard that she is of Neapolis, and beautiful.\'\'Beautiful! her beauty is a thing to dazzle the day!  Neapolis! nay, sheis Greek by origin; Greece only could furnish forth such shapes.  Nydia,I love her!\'\'I thought so,\' replied Nydia, calmly.\'I love, and thou shalt tell her so.  I am about to send thee to her.Happy Nydia, thou wilt be in her chamber--thou wilt drink the music ofher voice--thou wilt bask in the sunny air of her presence!\'\'What! what! wilt thou send me from thee?\'\'Thou wilt go to Ione,\' answered Glaucus, in a tone that said, \'Whatmore canst thou desire?\'Nydia burst into tears.Glaucus, raising himself, drew her towards him with the soothingcaresses of a brother.\'My child, my Nydia, thou weepest in ignorance of the happiness I bestowon thee.  She is gentle, and kind, and soft as the breeze of spring. Shewill be a sister to thy youth--she will appreciate thy winningtalents--she will love thy simple graces as none other could, for theyare like her own. Weepest thou still, fond fool?  I will not force thee,sweet. Wilt thou not do for me this kindness?\'\'Well, if I can serve thee, command.  See, I weep no longer--I am calm.\'\'That is my own Nydia,\' continued Glaucus, kissing her hand. \'Go, then,to her: if thou art disappointed in her kindness--if I have deceivedthee, return when thou wilt.  I do not give thee to another; I but lend.My home ever be thy refuge, sweet one.  Ah! would it could shelter allthe friendless and distressed!  But if my heart whispers truly, I shallclaim thee again soon, my child.  My home and Ione\'s will become thesame, and thou shalt dwell with both.\'A shiver passed through the slight frame of the blind girl, but she weptno more--she was resigned.\'Go, then, my Nydia, to Ione\'s house--they shall show thee the way. Takeher the fairest flowers thou canst pluck; the vase which contains them Iwill give thee: thou must excuse its unworthiness.  Thou shalt take,too, with thee the lute that I gave thee yesterday, and from which thouknowest so well to awaken the charming spirit.  Thou shalt give her,also, this letter, in which, after a hundred efforts, I have embodiedsomething of my thoughts. Let thy ear catch every accent, everymodulation of her voice, and tell me, when we meet again, if its musicshould flatter me or discourage.  It is now, Nydia, some days since Ihave been admitted to Ione; there is something mysterious in thisexclusion.  I am distracted with doubts and fears; learn--for thou artquick, and thy care for me will sharpen tenfold thy acuteness--learn thecause of this unkindness; speak of me as often as thou canst; let myname come ever to thy lips: insinuate how I love rather than proclaimit; watch if she sighs whilst thou speakest, if she answer thee; or, ifshe reproves, in what accents she reproves.  Be my friend, plead for me:and oh! how vastly wilt thou overpay the little I have done for thee!Thou comprehendest, Nydia; thou art yet a child--have I said more thanthou canst understand?\'\'No.\'\'And thou wilt serve me?\'\'Yes.\'\'Come to me when thou hast gathered the flowers, and I will give theethe vase I speak of; seek me in the chamber of Leda.  Pretty one, thoudost not grieve now?\'\'Glaucus, I am a slave; what business have I with grief or joy?\'\'Sayest thou so?  No, Nydia, be free.  I give thee freedom; enjoy it asthou wilt, and pardon me that I reckoned on thy desire to serve me.\'\'You are offended.  Oh! I would not, for that which no freedom can give,offend you, Glaucus.  My guardian, my saviour, my protector, forgive thepoor blind girl!  She does not grieve even in leaving thee, if she cancontribute to thy happiness.\'\'May the gods bless this grateful heart!\' said Glaucus, greatly moved;and, unconscious of the fires he excited, he repeatedly kissed herforehead.\'Thou forgivest me,\' said she, \'and thou wilt talk no more of freedom;my happiness is to be thy slave: thou hast promised thou wilt not giveme to another...\'\'I have promised.\'\'And now, then, I will gather the flowers.\'Silently, Nydia took from the hand of Glaucus the costly and jewelledvase, in which the flowers vied with each other in hue and fragrance;tearlessly she received his parting admonition.  She paused for a momentwhen his voice ceased--she did not trust herself to reply--she soughthis hand--she raised it to her lips, dropped her veil over her face, andpassed at once from his presence.  She paused again as she reached thethreshold; she stretched her hands towards it, and murmured:\'Three happy days--days of unspeakable delight, have I known since Ipassed thee--blessed threshold! may peace dwell ever with thee when I amgone!  And now, my heart tears itself from thee, and the only sound itutters bids me--die!\'Chapter VITHE HAPPY BEAUTY AND THE BLIND SLAVE.A SLAVE entered the chamber of Ione.  A messenger from Glaucus desiredto be admitted.Ione hesitated an instant.\'She is blind, that messenger,\' said the slave; \'she will do hercommission to none but thee.\'Base is that heart which does not respect affliction!  The moment sheheard the messenger was blind, Ione felt the impossibility of returninga chilling reply.  Glaucus had chosen a herald that was indeed sacred--aherald that could not be denied.\'What can he want with me? what message can he send?\' and the heart ofIone beat quick.  The curtain across the door was withdrawn; a soft andecholess step fell upon the marble; and Nydia, led by one of theattendants, entered with her precious gift.She stood still a moment, as if listening for some sound that mightdirect her.\'Will the noble Ione,\' said she, in a soft and low voice, \'deign tospeak, that I may know whither to steer these benighted steps, and thatI may lay my offerings at her feet?\'\'Fair child,\' said Ione, touched and soothingly, \'give not thyself thepain to cross these slippery floors, my attendant will bring to me whatthou hast to present\'; and she motioned to the handmaid to take thevase.\'I may give these flowers to none but thee,\' answered Nydia; and, guidedby her ear, she walked slowly to the place where Ione sat, and kneelingwhen she came before her, proffered the vase.Ione took it from her hand, and placed it on the table at her side.  Shethen raised her gently, and would have seated her on the couch, but thegirl modestly resisted.\'I have not yet discharged my office,\' said she; and she drew the letterof Glaucus from her vest.  \'This will, perhaps, explain why he who sentme chose so unworthy a messenger to Ione.\'The Neapolitan took the letter with a hand, the trembling of which Nydiaat once felt and sighed to feel.  With folded arms, and downcast looks,she stood before the proud and stately form of Ione--no less proud,perhaps, in her attitude of submission.  Ione waved her hand, and theattendants withdrew; she gazed again upon the form of the young slave insurprise and beautiful compassion; then, retiring a little from her, sheopened and read the following letter:\'Glaucus to Ione sends more than he dares to utter.  Is Ione ill? thyslaves tell me ""No"", and that assurance comforts me.  Has Glaucusoffended Ione?--ah! that question I may not ask from them.  For fivedays I have been banished from thy presence.  Has the sun shone?--I knowit not.  Has the sky smiled?--it has had no smile for me.  My sun and mysky are Ione.  Do I offend thee?  Am I too bold?  Do I say that on thetablet which my tongue has hesitated to breathe?  Alas! it is in thineabsence that I feel most the spells by which thou hast subdued me.  Andabsence, that deprives me of joy, brings me courage.  Thou wilt not seeme; thou hast banished also the common flatterers that flock aroundthee.  Canst thou confound me with them?  It is not possible! Thouknowest too well that I am not of them--that their clay is not mine. Foreven were I of the humblest mould, the fragrance of the rose haspenetrated me, and the spirit of thy nature hath passed within me, toembalm, to sanctify, to inspire.  Have they slandered me to thee, Ione?Thou wilt not believe them.  Did the Delphic oracle itself tell me thouwert unworthy, I would not believe it; and am I less incredulous thanthou I think of the last time we met--of the song which I sang tothee--of the look that thou gavest me in return. Disguise it as thou wilt,Ione, there is something kindred between us, and our eyes acknowledgedit, though our lips were silent.  Deign to see me, to listen to me, andafter that exclude me if thou wilt.  I meant not so soon to say I loved.But those words rush to my heart--they will have way.  Accept, then, myhomage and my vows.  We met first at the shrine of Pallas; shall we notmeet before a softer and a more ancient altar?\'Beautiful! adored Ione!  If my hot youth and my Athenian blood havemisguided and allured me, they have but taught my wanderings toappreciate the rest--the haven they have attained.  I hang up mydripping robes on the Sea-god\'s shrine.  I have escaped shipwreck.  Ihave found THEE.  Ione, deign to see me; thou art gentle to strangers,wilt thou be less merciful to those of thine own land?  I await thyreply.  Accept the flowers which I send--their sweet breath has alanguage more eloquent than words.  They take from the sun the odorousthey return--they are the emblem of the love that receives and repaystenfold--the emblem of the heart that drunk thy rays, and owes to theethe germ of the treasures that it proffers to thy smile.  I send theseby one whom thou wilt receive for her own sake, if not for mine. She,like us, is a stranger; her fathers\' ashes lie under brighter skies:but, less happy than we, she is blind and a slave.  Poor Nydia!  I seekas much as possible to repair to her the cruelties of Nature and ofFate, in asking permission to place her with thee.  She is gentle,quick, and docile. She is skilled in music and the song; and she is avery Chloris to the flowers.  She thinks, Ione, that thou wilt love her:if thou dost not, send her back to me.\'One word more--let me be bold, Ione.  Why thinkest thou so highly ofyon dark Egyptian? he hath not about him the air of honest men.  WeGreeks learn mankind from our cradle; we are not the less profound, inthat we affect no sombre mien; our lips smile, but our eyes aregrave--they observe--they note--they study.  Arbaces is not one to becredulously trusted: can it be that he hath wronged me to thee?  I thinkit, for I left him with thee; thou sawest how my presence stung him;since then thou hast not admitted me. Believe nothing that he can say tomy disfavor; if thou dost, tell me so at once; for this Ione owes toGlaucus.  Farewell! this letter touches thy hand; these characters meetthine eyes--shall they be more blessed than he who is their author. Oncemore, farewell!\'It seemed to Ione, as she read this letter, as if a mist had fallen fromher eyes.  What had been the supposed offence of Glaucus?--that he hadnot really loved!  And now, plainly, and in no dubious terms, heconfessed that love.  From that moment his power was fully restored.  Atevery tender word in that letter, so full of romantic and trustfulpassion, her heart smote her.  And had she doubted his faith, and hadshe believed another? and had she not, at least, allowed to him theculprit\'s right to know his crime, to plead in his defence?--the tearsrolled down her cheeks--she kissed the letter--she placed it in herbosom: and, turning to Nydia, who stood in the same place and in thesame posture:\'Wilt thou sit, my child,\' said she, \'while I write an answer to thisletter?\'\'You will answer it, then!\' said Nydia, coldly.  \'Well, the slave thataccompanied me will take back your answer.\'\'For you,\' said Ione, \'stay with me--trust me, your service shall belight.\'Nydia bowed her head.\'What is your name, fair girl?\'\'They call me Nydia.\'\'Your country?\'\'The land of Olympus--Thessaly.\'\'Thou shalt be to me a friend,\' said Ione, caressingly, \'as thou artalready half a countrywoman.  Meanwhile, I beseech thee, stand not onthese cold and glassy marbles.  There! now that thou art seated, I canleave thee for an instant.\'\'Ione to Glaucus greeting.  Come to me, Glaucus,\' wrote Ione, \'come tome to-morrow.  I may have been unjust to thee; but I will tell thee, atleast, the fault that has been imputed to thy charge.  Fear not,henceforth, the Egyptian--fear none.  Thou sayest thou hast expressedtoo much--alas! in these hasty words I have already done so. Farewell.\'As Ione reappeared with the letter, which she did not dare to read aftershe had written (Ah! common rashness, common timidity of love!)--Nydiastarted from her seat.\'You have written to Glaucus?\'\'I have.\'\'And will he thank the messenger who gives to him thy letter?\'Ione forgot that her companion was blind; she blushed from the brow tothe neck, and remained silent.\'I mean this,\' added Nydia, in a calmer tone; \'the lightest word ofcoldness from thee will sadden him--the lightest kindness will rejoice.If it be the first, let the slave take back thine answer; if it be thelast, let me--I will return this evening.\'\'And why, Nydia,\' asked Ione, evasively, \'Wouldst thou be the bearer ofmy letter?\'\'It is so, then!\' said Nydia.  \'Ah! how could it be otherwise; who couldbe unkind to Glaucus?\'\'My child,\' said Ione, a little more reservedly than before, \'thouspeakest warmly--Glaucus, then, is amiable in thine eyes?\'\'Noble Ione! Glaucus has been that to me which neither fortune nor thegods have been--a friend!\'The sadness mingled with dignity with which Nydia uttered these simplewords, affected the beautiful Ione: she bent down and kissed her.  \'Thouart grateful, and deservedly so; why should I blush to say that Glaucusis worthy of thy gratitude?  Go, my Nydia--take to him thyself thisletter--but return again.  If I am from home when thou returnest--asthis evening, perhaps, I shall be--thy chamber shall be prepared next myown.  Nydia, I have no sister--wilt thou be one to me?\' The Thessaliankissed the hand of Ione, and then said, with some embarrassment:\'One favor, fair Ione--may I dare to ask it?\'\'Thou canst not ask what I will not grant,\' replied the Neapolitan.\'They tell me,\' said Nydia, \'that thou art beautiful beyond theloveliness of earth.  Alas! I cannot see that which gladdens the world!Wilt thou suffer me, then, to pass my hand over thy face?--that is mysole criterion of beauty, and I usually guess aright.\'She did not wait for the answer of Ione, but, as she spoke, gently andslowly passed her hand over the bending and half-averted features of theGreek--features which but one image in the world can yet depicture andrecall--that image is the mutilated, but all-wondrous, statue in hernative city--her own Neapolis--that Parian face, before which all thebeauty of the Florentine Venus is poor and earthly--that aspect so fullof harmony--of youth--of genius--of the soul--which modern critics havesupposed the representation of Psyche.Her touch lingered over the braided hair and polished brow--over thedowny and damask cheek--over the dimpled lip--the swan-like and whitishneck.  \'I know now, that thou art beautiful,\' she said: \'and I canpicture thee to my darkness henceforth, and for ever!\'When Nydia left her, Ione sank into a deep but delicious reverie.Glaucus then loved her; he owned it--yes, he loved her.  She drew forthagain that dear confession; she paused over every word, she kissed everyline; she did not ask why he had been maligned, she only felt assuredthat he had been so. She wondered how she had ever believed a syllableagainst him; she wondered how the Egyptian had been enabled to exercisea power against Glaucus; she felt a chill creep over her as she againturned to his warning against Arbaces, and her secret fear of thatgloomy being darkened into awe.  She was awakened from these thoughts byher maidens, who came to announce to her that the hour appointed tovisit Arbaces was arrived; she started, she had forgotten the promise.Her first impression was to renounce it; her second, was to laugh at herown fears of her eldest surviving friend.  She hastened to add the usualornaments to her dress, and doubtful whether she should yet question theEgyptian more closely with respect to his accusation of Glaucus, orwhether she should wait till, without citing the authority, she shouldinsinuate to Glaucus the accusation itself, she took her way to thegloomy mansion of Arbaces.Chapter VIIIONE ENTRAPPED.  THE MOUSE TRIES TO GNAW THE NET.\'DEAREST Nydia!\' exclaimed Glaucus as he read the letter of Ione,\'whitest robed messenger that ever passed between earth and heaven--how,how shall I thank thee?\'\'I am rewarded,\' said the poor Thessalian.\'To-morrow--to-morrow! how shall I while the hours till then?\'The enamoured Greek would not let Nydia escape him, though she soughtseveral times to leave the chamber; he made her recite to him over andover again every syllable of the brief conversation that had taken placebetween her and Ione; a thousand times, forgetting her misfortune, hequestioned her of the looks, of the countenance of his beloved; and thenquickly again excusing his fault, he bade her recommence the wholerecital which he had thus interrupted.  The hours thus painful to Nydiapassed rapidly and delightfully to him, and the twilight had alreadydarkened ere he once more dismissed her to Ione with a fresh letter andwith new flowers.  Scarcely had she gone, than Clodius and several ofhis gay companions broke in upon him; they rallied him on his seclusionduring the whole day, and absence from his customary haunts; theyinvited him to accompany them to the various resorts in that livelycity, which night and day proffered diversity to pleasure.  Then, asnow, in the south (for no land, perhaps, losing more of greatness hasretained more of custom), it was the delight of the Italians to assembleat the evening; and, under the porticoes of temples or the shade of thegroves that interspersed the streets, listening to music or the recitalsof some inventive tale-teller, they hailed the rising moon withlibations of wine and the melodies of song.  Glaucus was too happy to beunsocial; he longed to cast off the exuberance of joy that oppressedhim. He willingly accepted the proposal of his comrades, and laughinglythey sallied out together down the populous and glittering streets.In the meantime Nydia once more gained the house of Ione, who had longleft it; she inquired indifferently whither Ione had gone.The answer arrested and appalled her.\'To the house of Arbaces--of the Egyptian?  Impossible!\'\'It is true, my little one,\' said the slave, who had replied to herquestion.  \'She has known the Egyptian long.\'\'Long! ye gods, yet Glaucus loves her?\' murmured Nydia to herself.\'And has,\' asked she aloud, \'has she often visited him before?\'\'Never till now,\' answered the slave.  \'If all the rumored scandal ofPompeii be true, it would be better, perhaps, if she had not venturedthere at present.  But she, poor mistress mine, hears nothing of thatwhich reaches us; the talk of the vestibulum reaches not to theperistyle.\'\'Never till now!\' repeated Nydia.  \'Art thou sure?\'\'Sure, pretty one: but what is that to thee or to us?\'Nydia hesitated a moment, and then, putting down the flowers with whichshe had been charged, she called to the slave who had accompanied her,and left the house without saying another word.Not till she had got half-way back to the house of Glaucus did she breaksilence, and even then she only murmured inly:\'She does not dream--she cannot--of the dangers into which she hasplunged. Fool that I am--shall I save her?--yes, for I love Glaucusbetter than myself.\'When she arrived at the house of the Athenian, she learnt that he hadgone out with a party of his friends, and none knew whither.  Heprobably would not be home before midnight.The Thessalian groaned; she sank upon a seat in the hall and covered herface with her hands as if to collect her thoughts. \'There is no time tobe lost,\' thought she, starting up.  She turned to the slave who hadaccompanied her.\'Knowest thou,\' said she, \'if Ione has any relative, any intimate friendat Pompeii?\'\'Why, by Jupiter!\' answered the slave, \'art thou silly enough to ask thequestion?  Every one in Pompeii knows that Ione has a brother who, youngand rich, has been--under the rose I speak--so foolish as to become apriest of Isis.\'\'A priest of Isis!  O Gods!  his name?\'\'Apaecides.\'\'I know it all,\' muttered Nydia: \'brother and sister, then, are to beboth victims! Apaecides! yes, that was the name I heard in...  Ha! hewell, then, knows the peril that surrounds his sister; I will go tohim.\'She sprang up at that thought, and taking the staff which always guidedher steps, she hastened to the neighboring shrine of Isis. Till she hadbeen under the guardianship of the kindly Greek, that staff had sufficedto conduct the poor blind girl from corner to corner of Pompeii.  Everystreet, every turning in the more frequented parts, was familiar to her;and as the inhabitants entertained a tender and half-superstitiousveneration for those subject to her infirmity, the passengers had alwaysgiven way to her timid steps.  Poor girl, she little dreamed that sheshould, ere many days were passed, find her blindness her protection,and a guide far safer than the keenest eyes!But since she had been under the roof of Glaucus, he had ordered a slaveto accompany her always; and the poor devil thus appointed, who wassomewhat of the fattest, and who, after having twice performed thejourney to Ione\'s house, now saw himself condemned to a third excursion(whither the gods only knew), hastened after her, deploring his fate,and solemnly assuring Castor and Pollux that he believed the blind girlhad the talaria of Mercury as well as the infirmity of Cupid.Nydia, however, required but little of his assistance to find her way tothe popular temple of Isis: the space before it was now deserted, andshe won without obstacle to the sacred rail.\'There is no one here,\' said the fat slave.  \'What dost thou want, orwhom Knowest thou not that the priests do not live in the temple?\'\'Call out,\' said she, impatiently; \'night and day there is always oneflamen, at least, watching in the shrine of Isis.\'The slave called--no one appeared.\'Seest thou no one?\'\'No one.\'\'Thou mistakest; I hear a sigh: look again.\'The slave, wondering and grumbling, cast round his heavy eyes, andbefore one of the altars, whose remains still crowd the narrow space, hebeheld a form bending as in meditation.\'I see a figure, said he; \'and by the white garments, it is a priest.\'\'O flamen of Isis!\' cried Nydia; \'servant of the Most Ancient, hear me!\'\'Who calls?\' said a low and melancholy voice.\'One who has no common tidings to impart to a member of your body: Icome to declare and not to ask oracles.\'\'With whom wouldst thou confer?  This is no hour for thy conference;depart, disturb me not; the night is sacred to the gods, the day tomen.\'\'Methinks I know thy voice? thou art he whom I seek; yet I have heardthee speak but once before.  Art thou not the priest Apaecides?\'\'I am that man,\' replied the priest, emerging from the altar, andapproaching the rail.\'Thou art! the gods be praised!\' Waving her hand to the slave, she badehim withdraw to a distance; and he, who naturally imagined somesuperstition connected, perhaps, with the safety of Ione, could alonelead her to the temple, obeyed, and seated himself on the ground, at alittle distance. \'Hush!\' said she, speaking quick and low; \'art thouindeed Apaecides?\'\'If thou knowest me, canst thou not recall my features?\'\'I am blind,\' answered Nydia; \'my eyes are in my ear, and thatrecognizes thee: yet swear that thou art he.\'\'By the gods I swear it, by my right hand, and by the moon!\'\'Hush! speak low--bend near--give me thy hand; knowest thou Arbaces?Hast thou laid flowers at the feet of the dead?  Ah! thy hand iscold--hark yet!--hast thou taken the awful vow?\'\'Who art thou, whence comest thou, pale maiden?\' said Apaecides,fearfully: \'I know thee not; thine is not the breast on which this headhath lain; I have never seen thee before.\'\'But thou hast heard my voice: no matter, those recollections it shouldshame us both to recall.  Listen, thou hast a sister.\'\'Speak! speak! what of her?\'\'Thou knowest the banquets of the dead, stranger--it pleases thee,perhaps, to share them--would it please thee to have thy sister apartaker?  Would it please thee that Arbaces was her host?\'\'O gods, he dare not!  Girl, if thou mockest me, tremble!  I will tearthee limb from limb!\'\'I speak the truth; and while I speak, Ione is in the halls ofArbaces--for the first time his guest.  Thou knowest if there be perilin that first time!  Farewell!  I have fulfilled my charge.\'\'Stay! stay!\' cried the priest, passing his wan hand over his brow.  \'Ifthis be true, what--what can be done to save her?  They may not admitme.  I know not all the mazes of that intricate mansion.  O Nemesis!justly am I punished!\'\'I will dismiss yon slave, be thou my guide and comrade; I will leadthee to the private door of the house: I will whisper to thee the wordwhich admits. Take some weapon: it may be needful!\'\'Wait an instant,\' said Apaecides, retiring into one of the cells thatflank the temple, and reappearing in a few moments wrapped in a largecloak, which was then much worn by all classes, and which concealed hissacred dress. \'Now,\' he said, grinding his teeth, \'if Arbaces hath daredto--but he dare not! he dare not!  Why should I suspect him?  Is he sobase a villain?  I will not think it--yet, sophist! dark bewilderer thathe is!  O gods protect--hush! are there gods?  Yes, there is onegoddess, at least, whose voice I can command; and that is--Vengeance!\'Muttering these disconnected thoughts, Apaecides, followed by his silentand sightless companion, hastened through the most solitary paths to thehouse of the Egyptian.The slave, abruptly dismissed by Nydia, shrugged his shoulders, mutteredan adjuration, and, nothing loath, rolled off to his cubiculum.Chapter VIIITHE SOLITUDE AND SOLILOQUY OF THE EGYPTIAN.  HIS CHARACTER ANALYSED.WE must go back a few hours in the progress of our story.  At the firstgrey dawn of the day, which Glaucus had already marked with white, theEgyptian was seated, sleepless and alone, on the summit of the lofty andpyramidal tower which flanked his house.  A tall parapet around itserved as a wall, and conspired, with the height of the edifice and thegloomy trees that girded the mansion, to defy the prying eyes ofcuriosity or observation.  A table, on which lay a scroll, filled withmystic figures, was before him. On high, the stars waxed dim and faint,and the shades of night melted from the sterile mountain-tops; onlyabove Vesuvius there rested a deep and massy cloud, which for severaldays past had gathered darker and more solid over its summit.  Thestruggle of night and day was more visible over the broad ocean, whichstretched calm, like a gigantic lake, bounded by the circling shoresthat, covered with vines and foliage, and gleaming here and there withthe white walls of sleeping cities, sloped to the scarce rippling waves.It was the hour above all others most sacred to the daring science ofthe Egyptian--the science which would read our changeful destinies inthe stars.He had filled his scroll, he had noted the moment and the sign; and,leaning upon his hand, he had surrendered himself to the thoughts whichhis calculation excited.\'Again do the stars forewarn me!  Some danger, then, assuredly awaitsme!\' said he, slowly; \'some danger, violent and sudden in its nature.The stars wear for me the same mocking menace which, if our chroniclesdo not err, they once wore for Pyrrhus--for him, doomed to strive forall things, to enjoy none--all attacking, nothing gaining--battleswithout fruit, laurels without triumph, fame without success; at lastmade craven by his own superstitions, and slain like a dog by a tilefrom the hand of an old woman! Verily, the stars flatter when they giveme a type in this fool of war--when they promise to the ardour of mywisdom the same results as to the madness of his ambition--perpetualexercise--no certain goal!--the Sisyphus task, the mountain and thestone!--the stone, a gloomy image!--it reminds me that I am threatenedwith somewhat of the same death as the Epirote.  Let me look again.""Beware,"" say the shining prophets, ""how thou passest under ancientroofs, or besieged walls, or overhanging cliffs--a stone hurled fromabove, is charged by the curses of destiny against thee!"" And, at nodistant date from this, comes the peril: but I cannot, of a certainty,read the day and hour.  Well! if my glass runs low, the sands shallsparkle to the last. Yet, if I escape this peril--ay, if Iescape--bright and clear as the moonlight track along the waters glowsthe rest of my existence.  I see honors, happiness, success, shiningupon every billow of the dark gulf beneath which I must sink at last.What, then, with such destinies beyond the peril, shall I succumb to theperil?  My soul whispers hope, it sweeps exultingly beyond the bodinghour, it revels in the future--its own courage is its fittest omen.  IfI were to perish so suddenly and so soon, the shadow of death woulddarken over me, and I should feel the icy presentiment of my doom.  Mysoul would express, in sadness and in gloom, its forecast of the drearyOrcus.  But it smiles--it assures me of deliverance.\'As he thus concluded his soliloquy, the Egyptian involuntarily rose.  Hepaced rapidly the narrow space of that star-roofed floor, and, pausingat the parapet, looked again upon the grey and melancholy heavens.  Thechills of the faint dawn came refreshingly upon his brow, and graduallyhis mind resumed its natural and collected calm.  He withdrew his gazefrom the stars, as, one after one, they receded into the depths ofheaven; and his eyes fell over the broad expanse below.  Dim in thesilenced port of the city rose the masts of the galleys; along that martof luxury and of labor was stilled the mighty hum.  No lights, save hereand there from before the columns of a temple, or in the porticoes ofthe voiceless forum, broke the wan and fluctuating light of thestruggling morn.  From the heart of the torpid city, so soon to vibratewith a thousand passions, there came no sound: the streams of lifecirculated not; they lay locked under the ice of sleep.  From the hugespace of the amphitheatre, with its stony seats rising one above theother--coiled and round as some slumbering monster--rose a thin andghastly mist, which gathered darker, and more dark, over the scatteredfoliage that gloomed in its vicinity.  The city seemed as, after theawful change of seventeen ages, it seems now to the traveler,--a City ofthe Dead.The ocean itself--that serene and tideless sea--lay scarce less hushed,save that from its deep bosom came, softened by the distance, a faintand regular murmur, like the breathing of its sleep; and curving far, aswith outstretched arms, into the green and beautiful land, it seemedunconsciously to clasp to its breast the cities sloping to itsmargin--Stabiae, and Herculaneum, and Pompeii--those children anddarlings of the deep.  \'Ye slumber,\' said the Egyptian, as he scowledover the cities, the boast and flower of Campania; \'ye slumber!--wouldit were the eternal repose of death! As ye now--jewels in the crown ofempire--so once were the cities of the Nile!  Their greatness hathperished from them, they sleep amidst ruins, their palaces and theirshrines are tombs, the serpent coils in the grass of their streets, thelizard basks in their solitary halls.  By that mysterious law of Nature,which humbles one to exalt the other, ye have thriven upon their ruins;thou, haughty Rome, hast usurped the glories of Sesostris andSemiramis--thou art a robber, clothing thyself with their spoils!  Andthese--slaves in thy triumph--that I (the last son of forgottenmonarchs) survey below, reservoirs of thine all-pervading power andluxury, I curse as I behold! The time shall come when Egypt shall beavenged! when the barbarian\'s steed shall make his manger in the GoldenHouse of Nero! and thou that hast sown the wind with conquest shalt reapthe harvest in the whirlwind of desolation!\'As the Egyptian uttered a prediction which fate so fearfully fulfilled,a more solemn and boding image of ill omen never occurred to the dreamsof painter or of poet.  The morning light, which can pale so wanly eventhe young cheek of beauty, gave his majestic and stately features almostthe colors of the grave, with the dark hair falling massively aroundthem, and the dark robes flowing long and loose, and the armoutstretched from that lofty eminence, and the glittering eyes, fiercewith a savage gladness--half prophet and half fiend!He turned his gaze from the city and the ocean; before him lay thevineyards and meadows of the rich Campania.  The gate and walls--ancient,half Pelasgic--of the city, seemed not to bound its extent. Villas andvillages stretched on every side up the ascent of Vesuvius, not nearlythen so steep or so lofty as at present.  For, as Rome itself is builton an exhausted volcano, so in similar security the inhabitants of theSouth tenanted the green and vine-clad places around a volcano whosefires they believed at rest for ever.  From the gate stretched the longstreet of tombs, various in size and architecture, by which, on thatside, the city is as yet approached. Above all, rode the cloud-cappedsummit of the Dread Mountain, with the shadows, now dark, now light,betraying the mossy caverns and ashy rocks, which testified the pastconflagrations, and might have prophesied--but man is blind--that whichwas to come!Difficult was it then and there to guess the causes why the tradition ofthe place wore so gloomy and stern a hue; why, in those smiling plains,for miles around--to Baiae and Misenum--the poets had imagined theentrance and thresholds of their hell--their Acheron, and their fabledStyx: why, in those Phlegrae, now laughing with the vine, they placedthe battles of the gods, and supposed the daring Titans to have soughtthe victory of heaven--save, indeed, that yet, in yon seared and blastedsummit, fancy might think to read the characters of the Olympianthunderbolt.But it was neither the rugged height of the still volcano, nor thefertility of the sloping fields, nor the melancholy avenue of tombs, northe glittering villas of a polished and luxurious people, that nowarrested the eye of the Egyptian.  On one part of the landscape, themountain of Vesuvius descended to the plain in a narrow and uncultivatedridge, broken here and there by jagged crags and copses of wild foliage.At the base of this lay a marshy and unwholesome pool; and the intentgaze of Arbaces caught the outline of some living form moving by themarshes, and stooping ever and anon as if to pluck its rank produce.\'Ho!\' said he, aloud, \'I have then, another companion in these unworldlynight-watches.  The witch of Vesuvius is abroad.  What! doth she, too,as the credulous imagine--doth she, too, learn the lore of the greatstars? Hath she been uttering foul magic to the moon, or culling (as herpauses betoken) foul herbs from the venomous marsh? Well, I must seethis fellow-laborer.  Whoever strives to know learns that no human loreis despicable.  Despicable only you--ye fat and bloated things--slavesof luxury--sluggards in thought--who, cultivating nothing but the barrensense, dream that its poor soil can produce alike the myrtle and thelaurel.  No, the wise only can enjoy--to us only true luxury is given,when mind, brain, invention, experience, thought, learning, imagination,all contribute like rivers to swell the seas of SENSE!--Ione!\'As Arbaces uttered that last and charmed word, his thoughts sunk at onceinto a more deep and profound channel.  His steps paused; he took nothis eyes from the ground; once or twice he smiled joyously, and then, ashe turned from his place of vigil, and sought his couch, he muttered,\'If death frowns so near, I will say at least that I have lived--Ioneshall be mine!\'The character of Arbaces was one of those intricate and varied webs, inwhich even the mind that sat within it was sometimes confused andperplexed. In him, the son of a fallen dynasty, the outcast of a sunkenpeople, was that spirit of discontented pride, which ever rankles in oneof a sterner mould, who feels himself inexorably shut from the sphere inwhich his fathers shone, and to which Nature as well as birth no lessentitles himself.  This sentiment hath no benevolence; it wars withsociety, it sees enemies in mankind.  But with this sentiment did not goits common companion, poverty. Arbaces possessed wealth which equalledthat of most of the Roman nobles; and this enabled him to gratify to theutmost the passions which had no outlet in business or ambition.Travelling from clime to clime, and beholding still Rome everywhere, heincreased both his hatred of society and his passion for pleasure.  Hewas in a vast prison, which, however, he could fill with the ministersof luxury.  He could not escape from the prison, and his only object,therefore, was to give it the character of the palace.  The Egyptians,from the earliest time, were devoted to the joys of sense; Arbacesinherited both their appetite for sensuality and the glow of imaginationwhich struck light from its rottenness.  But still, unsocial in hispleasures as in his graver pursuits, and brooking neither superior norequal, he admitted few to his companionship, save the willing slaves ofhis profligacy.  He was the solitary lord of a crowded harem; but, withall, he felt condemned to that satiety which is the constant curse ofmen whose intellect is above their pursuits, and that which once hadbeen the impulse of passion froze down to the ordinance of custom.From the disappointments of sense he sought to raise himself by thecultivation of knowledge; but as it was not his object to serve mankind,so he despised that knowledge which is practical and useful.  His darkimagination loved to exercise itself in those more visionary and obscureresearches which are ever the most delightful to a wayward and solitarymind, and to which he himself was invited by the daring pride of hisdisposition and the mysterious traditions of his clime. Dismissing faithin the confused creeds of the heathen world, he reposed the greatestfaith in the power of human wisdom. He did not know (perhaps no one inthat age distinctly did) the limits which Nature imposes upon ourdiscoveries.  Seeing that the higher we mount in knowledge the morewonders we behold, he imagined that Nature not only worked miracles inher ordinary course, but that she might, by the cabala of some mastersoul, be diverted from that course itself.  Thus he pursued science,across her appointed boundaries, into the land of perplexity and shadow.From the truths of astronomy he wandered into astrological fallacy; fromthe secrets of chemistry he passed into the spectral labyrinth of magic;and he who could be sceptical as to the power of the gods, wascredulously superstitious as to the power of man.The cultivation of magic, carried at that day to a singular height amongthe would-be wise, was especially Eastern in its origin; it was alien tothe early philosophy of the Greeks; nor had it been received by themwith favor until Ostanes, who accompanied the army of Xerxes,introduced, amongst the simple credulities of Hellas, the solemnsuperstitions of Zoroaster.  Under the Roman emperors it had become,however, naturalized at Rome (a meet subject for Juvenal\'s fiery wit).Intimately connected with magic was the worship of Isis, and theEgyptian religion was the means by which was extended the devotion toEgyptian sorcery.  The theurgic, or benevolent magic--the goetic, ordark and evil necromancy--were alike in pre-eminent repute during thefirst century of the Christian era; and the marvels of Faustus are notcomparable to those of Apollonius.  Kings, courtiers, and sages, alltrembled before the professors of the dread science.  And not the leastremarkable of his tribe was the most formidable and profound Arbaces.His fame and his discoveries were known to all the cultivators of magic;they even survived himself.  But it was not by his real name that he washonored by the sorcerer and the sage: his real name, indeed, was unknownin Italy, for \'Arbaces\' was not a genuinely Egyptian but a Medianappellation, which, in the admixture and unsettlement of the ancientraces, had become common in the country of the Nile; and there werevarious reasons, not only of pride, but of policy (for in youth he hadconspired against the majesty of Rome), which induced him to conceal histrue name and rank.  But neither by the name he had borrowed from theMede, nor by that which in the colleges of Egypt would have attested hisorigin from kings, did the cultivators of magic acknowledge the potentmaster.  He received from their homage a more mystic appellation, andwas long remembered in Magna Graecia and the Eastern plain by the nameof \'Hermes, the Lord of the Flaming Belt\'. His subtle speculations andboasted attributes of wisdom, recorded in various volumes, were amongthose tokens \'of the curious arts\' which the Christian converts mostjoyfully, yet most fearfully, burnt at Ephesus, depriving posterity ofthe proofs of the cunning of the fiend.The conscience of Arbaces was solely of the intellect--it was awed by nomoral laws.  If man imposed these checks upon the herd, so he believedthat man, by superior wisdom, could raise himself above them. \'If (hereasoned) I have the genius to impose laws, have I not the right tocommand my own creations?  Still more, have I not the right tocontrol--to evade--to scorn--the fabrications of yet meaner intellectsthan my own?\' Thus, if he were a villain, he justified his villainy bywhat ought to have made him virtuous--namely, the elevation of hiscapacities.Most men have more or less the passion for power; in Arbaces thatpassion corresponded exactly to his character.  It was not the passionfor an external and brute authority.  He desired not the purple and thefasces, the insignia of vulgar command.  His youthful ambition oncefoiled and defeated, scorn had supplied its place--his pride, hiscontempt for Rome--Rome, which had become the synonym of the world(Rome, whose haughty name he regarded with the same disdain as thatwhich Rome herself lavished upon the barbarian), did not permit him toaspire to sway over others, for that would render him at once the toolor creature of the emperor.  He, the Son of the Great Race ofRameses--he execute the orders of, and receive his power from,another!--the mere notion filled him with rage.  But in rejecting anambition that coveted nominal distinctions, he but indulged the more inthe ambition to rule the heart.  Honoring mental power as the greatestof earthly gifts, he loved to feel that power palpably in himself, byextending it over all whom he encountered.  Thus had he ever sought theyoung--thus had he ever fascinated and controlled them.  He loved tofind subjects in men\'s souls--to rule over an invisible and immaterialempire!--had he been less sensual and less wealthy, he might have soughtto become the founder of a new religion. As it was, his energies werechecked by his pleasures. Besides, however, the vague love of this moralsway (vanity so dear to sages!) he was influenced by a singular anddreamlike devotion to all that belonged to the mystic Land his ancestorshad swayed. Although he disbelieved in her deities, he believed in theallegories they represented (or rather he interpreted those allegoriesanew).  He loved to keep alive the worship of Egypt, because he thusmaintained the shadow and the recollection of her power.  He loaded,therefore, the altars of Osiris and of Isis with regal donations, andwas ever anxious to dignify their priesthood by new and wealthyconverts.  The vow taken--the priesthood embraced--he usually chose thecomrades of his pleasures from those whom he made his victims, partlybecause he thus secured to himself their secrecy--partly because he thusyet more confirmed to himself his peculiar power. Hence the motives ofhis conduct to Apaecides, strengthened as these were, in that instance,by his passion for Ione.He had seldom lived long in one place; but as he grew older, he grewmore wearied of the excitement of new scenes, and he had sojourned amongthe delightful cities of Campania for a period which surprised evenhimself.  In fact, his pride somewhat crippled his choice of residence.His unsuccessful conspiracy excluded him from those burning climes whichhe deemed of right his own hereditary possession, and which now cowered,supine and sunken, under the wings of the Roman eagle.  Rome herself washateful to his indignant soul; nor did he love to find his richesrivalled by the minions of the court, and cast into comparative povertyby the mighty magnificence of the court itself.  The Campanian citiesproffered to him all that his nature craved--the luxuries of anunequalled climate--the imaginative refinements of a voluptuouscivilization.  He was removed from the sight of a superior wealth; hewas without rivals to his riches; he was free from the spies of ajealous court.  As long as he was rich, none pried into his conduct.  Hepursued the dark tenour of his way undisturbed and secure.It is the curse of sensualists never to love till the pleasures of sensebegin to pall; their ardent youth is frittered away in countlessdesires--their hearts are exhausted.  So, ever chasing love, and taughtby a restless imagination to exaggerate, perhaps, its charms, theEgyptian had spent all the glory of his years without attaining theobject of his desires.  The beauty of to-morrow succeeded the beauty ofto-day, and the shadows bewildered him in his pursuit of the substance.When, two years before the present date, he beheld Ione, he saw, for thefirst time, one whom he imagined he could love.  He stood, then, uponthat bridge of life, from which man sees before him distinctly a wastedyouth on the one side, and the darkness of approaching age upon theother: a time in which we are more than ever anxious, perhaps, to secureto ourselves, ere it be yet too late, whatever we have been taught toconsider necessary to the enjoyment of a life of which the brighter halfis gone.With an earnestness and a patience which he had never before commandedfor his pleasures, Arbaces had devoted himself to win the heart of Ione.It did not content him to love, he desired to be loved. In this hope hehad watched the expanding youth of the beautiful Neapolitan; and,knowing the influence that the mind possesses over those who are taughtto cultivate the mind, he had contributed willingly to form the geniusand enlighten the intellect of Ione, in the hope that she would be thusable to appreciate what he felt would be his best claim to heraffection: viz, a character which, however criminal and perverted, wasrich in its original elements of strength and grandeur.  When he feltthat character to be acknowledged, he willingly allowed, nay, encouragedher, to mix among the idle votaries of pleasure, in the belief that hersoul, fitted for higher commune, would miss the companionship of hisown, and that, in comparison with others, she would learn to loveherself.  He had forgot, that as the sunflower to the sun, so youthturns to youth, until his jealousy of Glaucus suddenly apprised him ofhis error.  From that moment, though, as we have seen, he knew not theextent of his danger, a fiercer and more tumultuous direction was givento a passion long controlled.  Nothing kindles the fire of love like thesprinkling of the anxieties of jealousy; it takes then a wilder, a moreresistless flame; it forgets its softness; it ceases to be tender; itassumes something of the intensity--of the ferocity--of hate.Arbaces resolved to lose no further time upon cautious and perilouspreparations: he resolved to place an irrevocable barrier betweenhimself and his rivals: he resolved to possess himself of the person ofIone: not that in his present love, so long nursed and fed by hopespurer than those of passion alone, he would have been contented withthat mere possession. He desired the heart, the soul, no less than thebeauty, of Ione; but he imagined that once separated by a daring crimefrom the rest of mankind--once bound to Ione by a tie that memory couldnot break, she would be driven to concentrate her thoughts in him--thathis arts would complete his conquest, and that, according to the truemoral of the Roman and the Sabine, the empire obtained by force would becemented by gentler means. This resolution was yet more confirmed in himby his belief in the prophecies of the stars: they had long foretold tohim this year, and even the present month, as the epoch of some dreaddisaster, menacing life itself.  He was driven to a certain and limiteddate. He resolved to crowd, monarch-like, on his funeral pyre all thathis soul held most dear.  In his own words, if he were to die, heresolved to feel that he had lived, and that Ione should be his own.Chapter IXWHAT BECOMES OF IONE IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES. THE FIRST SIGNAL OF THEWRATH OF THE DREAD FOE.WHEN Ione entered the spacious hall of the Egyptian, the same awe whichhad crept over her brother impressed itself also upon her: there seemedto her as to him something ominous and warning in the still and mournfulfaces of those dread Theban monsters, whose majestic and passionlessfeatures the marble so well portrayed:  Their look, with the reach of past ages, was wise,  And the soul of eternity thought in their eyes.The tall AEthiopian slave grinned as he admitted her, and motioned toher to proceed.  Half-way up the hall she was met by Arbaces himself, infestive robes, which glittered with jewels.  Although it was broad daywithout, the mansion, according to the practice of the luxurious, wasartificially darkened, and the lamps cast their still and odor-givinglight over the rich floors and ivory roofs.\'Beautiful Ione,\' said Arbaces, as he bent to touch her hand, \'it is youthat have eclipsed the day--it is your eyes that light up the halls--itis your breath which fills them with perfumes.\'\'You must not talk to me thus,\' said Ione, smiling, \'you forget thatyour lore has sufficiently instructed my mind to render these gracefulflatteries to my person unwelcome.  It was you who taught me to disdainadulation: will you unteach your pupil?\'There was something so frank and charming in the manner of Ione, as shethus spoke, that the Egyptian was more than ever enamoured, and morethan ever disposed to renew the offence he had committed; he, however,answered quickly and gaily, and hastened to renew the conversation.He led her through the various chambers of a house, which seemed tocontain to her eyes, inexperienced to other splendor than the minuteelegance of Campanian cities, the treasures of the world.In the walls were set pictures of inestimable art, the lights shone overstatues of the noblest age of Greece.  Cabinets of gems, each cabinetitself a gem, filled up the interstices of the columns; the mostprecious woods lined the thresholds and composed the doors; gold andjewels seemed lavished all around.  Sometimes they were alone in theserooms--sometimes they passed through silent rows of slaves, who,kneeling as she passed, proffered to her offerings of bracelets, ofchains, of gems, which the Egyptian vainly entreated her to receive.\'I have often heard,\' said she, wonderingly, \'that you were rich; but Inever dreamed of the amount of your wealth.\'\'Would I could coin it all,\' replied the Egyptian, \'into one crown,which I might place upon that snowy brow!\'\'Alas! the weight would crush me; I should be a second Tarpeia,\'answered Ione, laughingly.\'But thou dost not disdain riches, O Ione! they know not what life iscapable of who are not wealthy.  Gold is the great magician of earth--itrealizes our dreams--it gives them the power of a god--there is agrandeur, a sublimity, in its possession; it is the mightiest, yet themost obedient of our slaves.\'The artful Arbaces sought to dazzle the young Neapolitan by histreasures and his eloquence; he sought to awaken in her the desire to bemistress of what she surveyed: he hoped that she would confound theowner with the possessions, and that the charms of his wealth would bereflected on himself.  Meanwhile, Ione was secretly somewhat uneasy atthe gallantries which escaped from those lips, which, till lately, hadseemed to disdain the common homage we pay to beauty; and with thatdelicate subtlety, which woman alone possesses, she sought to ward offshafts deliberately aimed, and to laugh or to talk away the meaning fromhis warming language.  Nothing in the world is more pretty than thatsame species of defence; it is the charm of the African necromancer whoprofessed with a feather to turn aside the winds.The Egyptian was intoxicated and subdued by her grace even more than byher beauty: it was with difficulty that he suppressed his emotions;alas! the feather was only powerful against the summer breezes--it wouldbe the sport of the storm.Suddenly, as they stood in one hall, which was surrounded by draperiesof silver and white, the Egyptian clapped his hands, and, as if byenchantment, a banquet rose from the floor--a couch or throne, with acrimson canopy, ascended simultaneously at the feet of Ione--and at thesame instant from behind the curtains swelled the invisible and softestmusic.Arbaces placed himself at the feet of Ione--and children, young andbeautiful as Loves, ministered to the feast.The feast was over, the music sank into a low and subdued strain, andArbaces thus addressed his beautiful guest:\'Hast thou never in this dark and uncertain world--hast thou neveraspired, my pupil, to look beyond--hast thou never wished to put asidethe veil of futurity, and to behold on the shores of Fate the shadowyimages of things to be?  For it is not the past alone that has itsghosts: each event to come has also its spectrum--its shade; when thehour arrives, life enters it, the shadow becomes corporeal, and walksthe world.  Thus, in the land beyond the grave, are ever two impalpableand spiritual hosts--the things to be, the things that have been! If byour wisdom we can penetrate that land, we see the one as the other, andlearn, as I have learned, not alone the mysteries of the dead, but alsothe destiny of the living.\'\'As thou hast learned!--Can wisdom attain so far?\'\'Wilt thou prove my knowledge, Ione, and behold the representation ofthine own fate?  It is a drama more striking than those of AEschylus: itis one I have prepared for thee, if thou wilt see the shadows performtheir part.\'The Neapolitan trembled; she thought of Glaucus, and sighed as well astrembled: were their destinies to be united?  Half incredulous, halfbelieving, half awed, half alarmed by the words of her strange host, sheremained for some moments silent, and then answered:\'It may revolt--it may terrify; the knowledge of the future will perhapsonly embitter the present!\'\'Not so, Ione.  I have myself looked upon thy future lot, and the ghostsof thy Future bask in the gardens of Elysium: amidst the asphodel andthe rose they prepare the garlands of thy sweet destiny, and the Fates,so harsh to others, weave only for thee the web of happiness and love.Wilt thou then come and behold thy doom, so that thou mayest enjoy itbeforehand?\'Again the heart of Ione murmured \'Glaucus\'; she uttered a half-audibleassent; the Egyptian rose, and taking her by the hand, he led her acrossthe banquet-room--the curtains withdrew as by magic hands, and the musicbroke forth in a louder and gladder strain; they passed a row ofcolumns, on either side of which fountains cast aloft their fragrantwaters; they descended by broad and easy steps into a garden.  The evehad commenced; the moon was already high in heaven, and those sweetflowers that sleep by day, and fill, with ineffable odorous, the airs ofnight, were thickly scattered amidst alleys cut through the star-litfoliage; or, gathered in baskets, lay like offerings at the feet of thefrequent statues that gleamed along their path.\'Whither wouldst thou lead me, Arbaces?\' said Ione, wonderingly.\'But yonder,\' said he, pointing to a small building which stood at theend of the vista.  \'It is a temple consecrated to the Fates--our ritesrequire such holy ground.\'They passed into a narrow hall, at the end of which hung a sablecurtain. Arbaces lifted it; Ione entered, and found herself in totaldarkness.\'Be not alarmed,\' said the Egyptian, \'the light will rise instantly.\'While he so spoke, a soft, and warm, and gradual light diffused itselfaround; as it spread over each object, Ione perceived that she was in anapartment of moderate size, hung everywhere with black; a couch withdraperies of the same hue was beside her.  In the centre of the room wasa small altar, on which stood a tripod of bronze.  At one side, upon alofty column of granite, was a colossal head of the blackest marble,which she perceived, by the crown of wheat-ears that encircled the brow,represented the great Egyptian goddess.  Arbaces stood before the altar:he had laid his garland on the shrine, and seemed occupied with pouringinto the tripod the contents of a brazen vase; suddenly from that tripodleaped into life a blue, quick, darting, irregular flame; the Egyptiandrew back to the side of Ione, and muttered some words in a languageunfamiliar to her ear; the curtain at the back of the altar wavedtremulously to and fro--it parted slowly, and in the aperture which wasthus made, Ione beheld an indistinct and pale landscape, which graduallygrew brighter and clearer as she gazed; at length she discovered plainlytrees, and rivers, and meadows, and all the beautiful diversity of therichest earth.  At length, before the landscape, a dim shadow glided; itrested opposite to Ione; slowly the same charm seemed to operate upon itas over the rest of the scene; it took form and shape, and lo!--in itsfeature and in its form Ione beheld herself!Then the scene behind the spectre faded away, and was succeeded by therepresentation of a gorgeous palace; a throne was raised in the centreof its hall, the dim forms of slaves and guards were ranged around it,and a pale hand held over the throne the likeness of a diadem.A new actor now appeared; he was clothed from head to foot in a darkrobe--his face was concealed--he knelt at the feet of the shadowyIone--he clasped her hand--he pointed to the throne, as if to invite herto ascend it.The Neapolitan\'s heart beat violently.  \'Shall the shadow discloseitself?\' whispered a voice beside her--the voice of Arbaces.\'Ah, yes!\' answered Ione, softly.Arbaces raised his hand--the spectre seemed to drop the mantle thatconcealed its form--and Ione shrieked--it was Arbaces himself that thusknelt before her.\'This is, indeed, thy fate!\' whispered again the Egyptian\'s voice in herear.  \'And thou art destined to be the bride of Arbaces.\'Ione started--the black curtain closed over the phantasmagoria: andArbaces himself--the real, the living Arbaces--was at her feet.\'Oh, Ione!\' said he, passionately gazing upon her, \'listen to one whohas long struggled vainly with his love.  I adore thee!  The Fates donot lie--thou art destined to be mine--I have sought the world around,and found none like thee.  From my youth upward, I have sighed for suchas thou art. I have dreamed till I saw thee--I wake, and I behold thee.Turn not away from me, Ione; think not of me as thou hast thought; I amnot that being--cold, insensate, and morose, which I have seemed tothee.  Never woman had lover so devoted--so passionate as I will be toIone.  Do not struggle in my clasp: see--I release thy hand.  Take itfrom me if thou wilt--well be it so!  But do not reject me, Ione--do notrashly reject--judge of thy power over him whom thou canst thustransform.  I, who never knelt to mortal being, kneel to thee.  I, whohave commanded fate, receive from thee my own.  Ione, tremble not, thouart my queen--my goddess--be my bride!  All the wishes thou canst formshall be fulfilled. The ends of the earth shall minister to thee--pomp,power, luxury, shall be thy slaves.  Arbaces shall have no ambition,save the pride of obeying thee. Ione, turn upon me those eyes--shed uponme thy smile. Dark is my soul when thy face is hid from it: shine overme, my sun--my heaven--my daylight!--Ione, Ione--do not reject my love!\'Alone, and in the power of this singular and fearful man, Ione was notyet terrified; the respect of his language, the softness of his voice,reassured her; and, in her own purity, she felt protection.  But she wasconfused--astonished: it was some moments before she could recover thepower of reply.\'Rise, Arbaces!\' said she at length; and she resigned to him once moreher hand, which she as quickly withdrew again, when she felt upon it theburning pressure of his lips.  \'Rise! and if thou art serious, if thylanguage be in earnest...\'\'If!\' said he tenderly.\'Well, then, listen to me: you have been my guardian, my friend, mymonitor; for this new character I was not prepared--think not,\' sheadded quickly, as she saw his dark eyes glitter with the fierceness ofhis passion--\'think not that I scorn--that I am untouched--that I am nothonored by this homage; but, say--canst thou hear me calmly?\'\'Ay, though thy words were lightning, and could blast me!\'\'I love another!\' said Ione, blushingly, but in a firm voice.\'By the gods--by hell!\' shouted Arbaces, rising to his fullest height;\'dare not tell me that--dare not mock me--it is impossible!--Whom hastthou seen--whom known?  Oh, Ione, it is thy woman\'s invention, thywoman\'s art that speaks--thou wouldst gain time; I have surprised--Ihave terrified thee.  Do with me as thou wilt--say that thou lovest notme; but say not that thou lovest another!\'\'Alas!\' began Ione; and then, appalled before his sudden andunlooked-for violence, she burst into tears.Arbaces came nearer to her--his breath glowed fiercely on her cheek; hewound his arms round her--she sprang from his embrace.  In the strugglea tablet fell from her bosom on the ground: Arbaces perceived, andseized it--it was the letter that morning received from Glaucus.  Ionesank upon the couch, half dead with terror.Rapidly the eyes of Arbaces ran over the writing; the Neapolitan did notdare to gaze upon him: she did not see the deadly paleness that cameover his countenance--she marked not his withering frown, nor thequivering of his lip, nor the convulsions that heaved his breast.  Heread it to the end, and then, as the letter fell from his hand, he said,in a voice of deceitful calmness:\'Is the writer of this the man thou lovest?\'Ione sobbed, but answered not.\'Speak!\' he rather shrieked than said.\'It is--it is!\'And his name--it is written here--his name is Glaucus!\'Ione, clasping her hands, looked round as for succour or escape.\'Then hear me,\' said Arbaces, sinking his voice into a whisper; \'thoushalt go to thy tomb rather than to his arms!  What! thinkest thouArbaces will brook a rival such as this puny Greek?  What! thinkest thouthat he has watched the fruit ripen, to yield it to another!  Prettyfool--no!  Thou art mine--all--only mine: and thus--thus I seize andclaim thee!\' As he spoke, he caught Ione in his arms; and, in thatferocious grasp, was all the energy--less of love than of revenge.But to Ione despair gave supernatural strength: she again tore herselffrom him--she rushed to that part of the room by which she hadentered--she half withdrew the curtain--he had seized her--again shebroke away from him--and fell, exhausted, and with a loud shriek, at thebase of the column which supported the head of the Egyptian goddess.Arbaces paused for a moment, as if to regain his breath; and thence oncemore darted upon his prey.At that instant the curtain was rudely torn aside, the Egyptian felt afierce and strong grasp upon his shoulder.  He turned--he beheld beforehim the flashing eyes of Glaucus, and the pale, worn, but menacing,countenance of Apaecides.  \'Ah,\' he muttered, as he glared from one tothe other, \'what Fury hath sent ye hither?\'\'Ate,\' answered Glaucus; and he closed at once with the Egyptian.Meanwhile, Apaecides raised his sister, now lifeless, from the ground;his strength, exhausted by a mind long overwrought, did not suffice tobear her away, light and delicate though her shape: he placed her,therefore, on the couch, and stood over her with a brandishing knife,watching the contest between Glaucus and the Egyptian, and ready toplunge his weapon in the bosom of Arbaces should he be victorious in thestruggle.  There is, perhaps, nothing on earth so terrible as the nakedand unarmed contest of animal strength, no weapon but those which Naturesupplies to rage.  Both the antagonists were now locked in each other\'sgrasp--the hand of each seeking the throat of the other--the face drawnback--the fierce eyes flashing--the muscles strained--the veinsswelled--the lips apart--the teeth set--both were strong beyond theordinary power of men, both animated by relentless wrath; they coiled,they wound, around each other; they rocked to and fro--they swayed fromend to end of their confined arena--they uttered cries of ire andrevenge--they were now before the altar--now at the base of the columnwhere the struggle had commenced: they drew back for breath--Arbacesleaning against the column--Glaucus a few paces apart.\'O ancient goddess!\' exclaimed Arbaces, clasping the column, and raisinghis eyes toward the sacred image it supported, \'protect thychosen--proclaim they vengeance against this thing of an upstart creed,who with sacrilegious violence profanes thy resting-place and assailsthy servant.\'As he spoke, the still and vast features of the goddess seemed suddenlyto glow with life; through the black marble, as through a transparentveil, flushed luminously a crimson and burning hue; around the headplayed and darted coruscations of livid lightning; the eyes became likeballs of lurid fire, and seemed fixed in withering and intolerable wrathupon the countenance of the Greek.  Awed and appalled by this sudden andmystic answer to the prayer of his foe, and not free from the hereditarysuperstitions of his race, the cheeks of Glaucus paled before thatstrange and ghastly animation of the marble--his knees knockedtogether--he stood, seized with a divine panic, dismayed, aghast, halfunmanned before his foe! Arbaces gave him not breathing time to recoverhis stupor: \'Die, wretch!\' he shouted, in a voice of thunder, as hesprang upon the Greek; \'the Mighty Mother claims thee as a livingsacrifice!\' Taken thus by surprise in the first consternation of hissuperstitious fears, the Greek lost his footing--the marble floor was assmooth as glass--he slid--he fell. Arbaces planted his foot on thebreast of his fallen foe.  Apaecides, taught by his sacred profession,as well as by his knowledge of Arbaces, to distrust all miraculousinterpositions, had not shared the dismay of his companion; he rushedforward--his knife gleamed in the air--the watchful Egyptian caught hisarm as it descended--one wrench of his powerful hand tore the weaponfrom the weak grasp of the priest--one sweeping blow stretched him tothe earth--with a loud and exulting yell Arbaces brandished the knife onhigh. Glaucus gazed upon his impending fate with unwinking eyes, and inthe stern and scornful resignation of a fallen gladiator, when, at thatawful instant, the floor shook under them with a rapid and convulsivethroe--a mightier spirit than that of the Egyptian was abroad!--a giantand crushing power, before which sunk into sudden impotence his passionand his arts. IT woke--it stirred--that Dread Demon of theEarthquake--laughing to scorn alike the magic of human guile and themalice of human wrath.  As a Titan, on whom the mountains are piled, itroused itself from the sleep of years, it moved on its torturedcouch--the caverns below groaned and trembled beneath the motion of itslimbs. In the moment of his vengeance and his power, the self-prizeddemigod was humbled to his real clay.  Far and wide along the soil wenta hoarse and rumbling sound--the curtains of the chamber shook as at theblast of a storm--the altar rocked--the tripod reeled, and high over theplace of contest, the column trembled and waved from side to side--thesable head of the goddess tottered and fell from its pedestal--and asthe Egyptian stooped above his intended victim, right upon his bendedform, right between the shoulder and the neck, struck the marble mass!The shock stretched him like the blow of death, at once, suddenly,without sound or motion, or semblance of life, upon the floor,apparently crushed by the very divinity he had impiously animated andinvoked!\'The Earth has preserved her children,\' said Glaucus, staggering to hisfeet.  \'Blessed be the dread convulsion!  Let us worship the providenceof the gods!\' He assisted Apaecides to rise, and then turned upward theface of Arbaces; it seemed locked as in death; blood gushed from theEgyptian\'s lips over his glittering robes; he fell heavily from the armsof Glaucus, and the red stream trickled slowly along the marble.  Againthe earth shook beneath their feet; they were forced to cling to eachother; the convulsion ceased as suddenly as it came; they tarried nolonger; Glaucus bore Ione lightly in his arms, and they fled from theunhallowed spot.  But scarce had they entered the garden than they weremet on all sides by flying and disordered groups of women and slaves,whose festive and glittering garments contrasted in mockery the solemnterror of the hour; they did not appear to heed the strangers--they wereoccupied only with their own fears.  After the tranquillity of sixteenyears, that burning and treacherous soil again menaced destruction; theyuttered but one cry, \'THE EARTHQUAKE!  THE EARTHQUAKE!\' and passingunmolested from the midst of them, Apaecides and his companions, withoutentering the house, hastened down one of the alleys, passed a small opengate, and there, sitting on a little mound over which spread the gloomof the dark green aloes, the moonlight fell on the bended figure of theblind girl--she was weeping bitterly.BOOK THE THIRDChapter ITHE FORUM OF THE POMPEIANS.  THE FIRST RUDE MACHINERY BY WHICH THE NEWERA OF THE WORLD WAS WROUGHT.IT was early noon, and the forum was crowded alike with the busy and theidle.  As at Paris at this day, so at that time in the cities of Italy,men lived almost wholly out of doors: the public buildings, the forum,the porticoes, the baths, the temples themselves, might be consideredtheir real homes; it was no wonder that they decorated so gorgeouslythese favorite places of resort--they felt for them a sort of domesticaffection as well as a public pride.  And animated was, indeed, theaspect of the forum of Pompeii at that time!  Along its broad pavement,composed of large flags of marble, were assembled various groups,conversing in that energetic fashion which appropriates a gesture toevery word, and which is still the characteristic of the people of thesouth.  Here, in seven stalls on one side the colonnade, sat themoney-changers, with their glittering heaps before them, and merchantsand seamen in various costumes crowding round their stalls.  On oneside, several men in long togas were seen bustling rapidly up to astately edifice, where the magistrates administered justice--these werethe lawyers, active, chattering, joking, and punning, as you may findthem at this day in Westminster.  In the centre of the space, pedestalssupported various statues, of which the most remarkable was the statelyform of Cicero.  Around the court ran a regular and symmetricalcolonnade of Doric architecture; and there several, whose business drewthem early to the place, were taking the slight morning repast whichmade an Italian breakfast, talking vehemently on the earthquake of thepreceding night as they dipped pieces of bread in their cups of dilutedwine.  In the open space, too, you might perceive various petty tradersexercising the arts of their calling.  Here one man was holding outribands to a fair dame from the country; another man was vaunting to astout farmer the excellence of his shoes; a third, a kind ofstall-restaurateur, still so common in the Italian cities, was supplyingmany a hungry mouth with hot messes from his small and itinerant stove,while--contrast strongly typical of the mingled bustle and intellect ofthe time--close by, a schoolmaster was expounding to his puzzled pupilsthe elements of the Latin grammar. A gallery above the portico, whichwas ascended by small wooden staircases, had also its throng; though, ashere the immediate business of the place was mainly carried on, itsgroups wore a more quiet and serious air.Every now and then the crowd below respectfully gave way as some senatorswept along to the Temple of Jupiter (which filled up one side of theforum, and was the senators\' hall of meeting), nodding with ostentatiouscondescension to such of his friends or clients as he distinguishedamongst the throng.  Mingling amidst the gay dresses of the betterorders you saw the hardy forms of the neighboring farmers, as they madetheir way to the public granaries.  Hard by the temple you caught a viewof the triumphal arch, and the long street beyond swarming withinhabitants; in one of the niches of the arch a fountain played,cheerily sparkling in the sunbeams; and above its cornice rose thebronzed and equestrian statue of Caligula, strongly contrasting the gaysummer skies.  Behind the stalls of the money-changers was that buildingnow called the Pantheon; and a crowd of the poorer Pompeians passedthrough the small vestibule which admitted to the interior, withpanniers under their arms, pressing on towards a platform, placedbetween two columns, where such provisions as the priests had rescuedfrom sacrifice were exposed for sale.At one of the public edifices appropriated to the business of the city,workmen were employed upon the columns, and you heard the noise of theirlabor every now and then rising above the hum of the multitude: thecolumns are unfinished to this day!All, then, united, nothing could exceed in variety the costumes, theranks, the manners, the occupations of the crowd--nothing could exceedthe bustle, the gaiety, the animation--where pleasure and commerce,idleness and labor, avarice and ambition, mingled in one gulf theirmotley rushing, yet harmonius, streams.Facing the steps of the Temple of Jupiter, with folded arms, and a knitand contemptuous brow, stood a man of about fifty years of age. Hisdress was remarkably plain--not so much from its material, as from theabsence of all those ornaments which were worn by the Pompeians of everyrank--partly from the love of show, partly, also, because they werechiefly wrought into those shapes deemed most efficacious in resistingthe assaults of magic and the influence of the evil eye.  His foreheadwas high and bald; the few locks that remained at the back of the headwere concealed by a sort of cowl, which made a part of his cloak, to beraised or lowered at pleasure, and was now drawn half-way over the head,as a protection from the rays of the sun. The color of his garments wasbrown, no popular hue with the Pompeians; all the usual admixtures ofscarlet or purple seemed carefully excluded.  His belt, or girdle,contained a small receptacle for ink, which hooked on to the girdle, astilus (or implement of writing), and tablets of no ordinary size.  Whatwas rather remarkable, the cincture held no purse, which was the almostindispensable appurtenance of the girdle, even when that purse had themisfortune to be empty!It was not often that the gay and egotistical Pompeians busiedthemselves with observing the countenances and actions of theirneighbors; but there was that in the lip and eye of this bystander soremarkably bitter and disdainful, as he surveyed the religiousprocession sweeping up the stairs of the temple, that it could not failto arrest the notice of many.\'Who is yon cynic?\' asked a merchant of his companion, a jeweller.\'It is Olinthus,\' replied the jeweller; \'a reputed Nazarene.\'The merchant shuddered.  \'A dread sect!\' said he, in a whispered andfearful voice.  \'It is said that when they meet at nights they alwayscommence their ceremonies by the murder of a new-born babe; they professa community of goods, too--the wretches!  A community of goods!  Whatwould become of merchants, or jewellers either, if such notions were infashion?\'\'That is very true,\' said the jeweller; \'besides, they wear nojewels--they mutter imprecations when they see a serpent; and at Pompeiiall our ornaments are serpentine.\'\'Do but observe,\' said a third, who was a fabricant of bronze, \'how yonNazarene scowls at the piety of the sacrificial procession. He ismurmuring curses on the temple, be sure.  Do you know, Celcinus, thatthis fellow, passing by my shop the other day, and seeing me employed ona statue of Minerva, told me with a frown that, had it been marble, hewould have broken it; but the bronze was too strong for him.  ""Break agoddess!"" said I.  ""A goddess!"" answered the atheist; ""it is a demon--anevil spirit!"" Then he passed on his way cursing.  Are such things to beborne?  What marvel that the earth heaved so fearfully last night,anxious to reject the atheist from her bosom?--An atheist, do I say?worse still--a scorner of the Fine Arts! Woe to us fabricants of bronze,if such fellows as this give the law to society!\'\'These are the incendiaries that burnt Rome under Nero,\' groaned thejeweller.While such were the friendly remarks provoked by the air and faith ofthe Nazarene, Olinthus himself became sensible of the effect he wasproducing; he turned his eyes round, and observed the intent faces ofthe accumulating throng, whispering as they gazed; and surveying themfor a moment with an expression, first of defiance and afterwards ofcompassion, he gathered his cloak round him and passed on, mutteringaudibly, \'Deluded idolaters!--did not last night\'s convulsion warn ye?Alas! how will ye meet the last day?\'The crowd that heard these boding words gave them differentinterpretations, according to their different shades of ignorance and offear; all, however, concurred in imagining them to convey some awfulimprecation.  They regarded the Christian as the enemy of mankind; theepithets they lavished upon him, of which \'Atheist\' was the most favoredand frequent, may serve, perhaps, to warn us, believers of that samecreed now triumphant, how we indulge the persecution of opinion Olinthusthen underwent, and how we apply to those whose notions differ from ourown the terms at that day lavished on the fathers of our faith.As Olinthus stalked through the crowd, and gained one of the moreprivate places of egress from the forum, he perceived gazing upon him apale and earnest countenance, which he was not slow to recognize.Wrapped in a pallium that partially concealed his sacred robes, theyoung Apaecides surveyed the disciple of that new and mysterious creed,to which at one time he had been half a convert.\'Is he, too, an impostor?  Does this man, so plain and simple in life,in garb, in mien--does he too, like Arbaces, make austerity the robe ofthe sensualist?  Does the veil of Vesta hide the vices of theprostitute?\'Olinthus, accustomed to men of all classes, and combining with theenthusiasm of his faith a profound experience of his kind, guessed,perhaps, by the index of the countenance, something of what passedwithin the breast of the priest.  He met the survey of Apaecides with asteady eye, and a brow of serene and open candour.\'Peace be with thee!\' said he, saluting Apaecides.\'Peace!\' echoed the priest, in so hollow a tone that it went at once tothe heart of the Nazarene.\'In that wish,\' continued Olinthus, \'all good things arecombined--without virtue thou canst not have peace.  Like the rainbow,Peace rests upon the earth, but its arch is lost in heaven.  Heavenbathes it in hues of light--it springs up amidst tears and clouds--it isa reflection of the Eternal Sun--it is an assurance of calm--it is thesign of a great covenant between Man and God.  Such peace, O young man!is the smile of the soul; it is an emanation from the distant orb ofimmortal light.  PEACE be with you!\'\'Alas!\' began Apaecides, when he caught the gaze of the curiousloiterers, inquisitive to know what could possibly be the theme ofconversation between a reputed Nazarene and a priest of Isis.  Hestopped short, and then added in a low tone: \'We cannot converse here, Iwill follow thee to the banks of the river; there is a walk which atthis time is usually deserted and solitary.\'Olinthus bowed assent.  He passed through the streets with a hasty step,but a quick and observant eye.  Every now and then he exchanged asignificant glance, a slight sign, with some passenger, whose garbusually betokened the wearer to belong to the humbler classes; forChristianity was in this the type of all other and less mightyrevolutions--the grain of mustard-seed was in the heart of the lowly.Amidst the huts of poverty and labor, the vast stream which afterwardspoured its broad waters beside the cities and palaces of earth took itsneglected source.Chapter IITHE NOONDAY EXCURSION ON THE CAMPANIAN SEAS.\'BUT tell me, Glaucus,\' said Ione, as they glided down the ripplingSarnus in their boat of pleasure, \'how camest thou with Apaecides to myrescue from that bad man?\'\'Ask Nydia yonder,\' answered the Athenian, pointing to the blind girl,who sat at a little distance from them, leaning pensively over her lyre;\'she must have thy thanks, not we.  It seems that she came to my house,and, finding me from home, sought thy brother in his temple; heaccompanied her to Arbaces; on their way they encountered me, with acompany of friends, whom thy kind letter had given me a spirit cheerfulenough to join.  Nydia\'s quick ear detected my voice--a few wordssufficed to make me the companion of Apaecides; I told not my associateswhy I left them--could I trust thy name to their light tongues andgossiping opinion?--Nydia led us to the garden gate, by which weafterwards bore thee--we entered, and were about to plunge into themysteries of that evil house, when we heard thy cry in anotherdirection.  Thou knowest the rest.\'Ione blushed deeply.  She then raised her eyes to those of Glaucus, andhe felt all the thanks she could not utter.  \'Come hither, my Nydia,\'said she, tenderly, to the Thessalian.\'Did I not tell thee that thou shouldst be my sister and friend? Hastthou not already been more?--my guardian, my preserver!\'\'It is nothing,\' answered Nydia coldly, and without stirring.\'Ah! I forgot,\' continued Ione, \'I should come to thee\'; and she movedalong the benches till she reached the place where Nydia sat, andflinging her arms caressingly round her, covered her cheeks with kisses.Nydia was that morning paler than her wont, and her countenance greweven more wan and colorless as she submitted to the embrace of thebeautiful Neapolitan.  \'But how camest thou, Nydia,\' whispered Ione, \'tosurmise so faithfully the danger I was exposed to?  Didst thou knowaught of the Egyptian?\'\'Yes, I knew of his vices.\'\'And how?\'\'Noble Ione, I have been a slave to the vicious--those whom I servedwere his minions.\'\'And thou hast entered his house since thou knewest so well that privateentrance?\'\'I have played on my lyre to Arbaces,\' answered the Thessalian, withembarrassment.\'And thou hast escaped the contagion from which thou hast saved Ione?\'returned the Neapolitan, in a voice too low for the ear of Glaucus.\'Noble Ione, I have neither beauty nor station; I am a child, and aslave, and blind.  The despicable are ever safe.\'It was with a pained, and proud, and indignant tone that Nydia made thishumble reply; and Ione felt that she only wounded Nydia by pursuing thesubject.  She remained silent, and the bark now floated into the sea.\'Confess that I was right, Ione,\' said Glaucus, \'in prevailing on theenot to waste this beautiful noon in thy chamber--confess that I wasright.\'\'Thou wert right, Glaucus,\' said Nydia, abruptly.\'The dear child speaks for thee,\' returned the Athenian.  \'But permit meto move opposite to thee, or our light boat will be over-balanced.\'So saying, he took his seat exactly opposite to Ione, and leaningforward, he fancied that it was her breath, and not the winds of summer,that flung fragrance over the sea.\'Thou wert to tell me,\' said Glaucus, \'why for so many days thy door wasclosed to me?\'\'Oh, think of it no more!\' answered Ione, quickly; \'I gave my ear towhat I now know was the malice of slander.\'\'And my slanderer was the Egyptian?\'Ione\'s silence assented to the question.\'His motives are sufficiently obvious.\'\'Talk not of him,\' said Ione, covering her face with her hands, as if toshut out his very thought.\'Perhaps he may be already by the banks of the slow Styx,\' resumedGlaucus; \'yet in that case we should probably have heard of his death.Thy brother, methinks, hath felt the dark influence of his gloomy soul.When we arrived last night at thy house he left me abruptly. Will heever vouchsafe to be my friend?\'\'He is consumed with some secret care,\' answered Ione, tearfully.\'Would that we could lure him from himself!  Let us join in that tenderoffice.\'\'He shall be my brother,\' returned the Greek.\'How calmly,\' said Ione, rousing herself from the gloom into which herthoughts of Apaecides had plunged her--\'how calmly the clouds seem torepose in heaven; and yet you tell me, for I knew it not myself, thatthe earth shook beneath us last night.\'\'It did, and more violently, they say, than it has done since the greatconvulsion sixteen years ago: the land we live in yet nurses mysteriousterror; and the reign of Pluto, which spreads beneath our burningfields, seems rent with unseen commotion.  Didst thou not feel the earthquake, Nydia, where thou wert seated last night?  and was it not thefear that it occasioned thee that made thee weep?\'\'I felt the soil creep and heave beneath me, like some monstrousserpent,\' answered Nydia; \'but as I saw nothing, I did not fear: Iimagined the convulsion to be a spell of the Egyptian\'s.  They say hehas power over the elements.\'\'Thou art a Thessalian, my Nydia,\' replied Glaucus, \'and hast a nationalright to believe in magic.\'Magic!--who doubts it?\' answered Nydia, simply: \'dost thou?\'\'Until last night (when a necromantic prodigy did indeed appal me),methinks I was not credulous in any other magic save that of love!\' saidGlaucus, in a tremulous voice, and fixing his eyes on Ione.\'Ah!\' said Nydia, with a sort of shiver, and she awoke mechanically afew pleasing notes from her lyre; the sound suited well the tranquilityof the waters, and the sunny stillness of the noon.\'Play to us, dear Nydia, said Glaucus--\'play and give us one of thineold Thessalian songs: whether it be of magic or not, as thou wilt--letit, at least, be of love!\'\'Of love!\' repeated Nydia, raising her large, wandering eyes, that everthrilled those who saw them with a mingled fear and pity; you couldnever familiarize yourself to their aspect: so strange did it seem thatthose dark wild orbs were ignorant of the day, and either so fixed wastheir deep mysterious gaze, or so restless and perturbed their glance,that you felt, when you encountered them, that same vague, and chilling,and half-preternatural impression, which comes over you in the presenceof the insane--of those who, having a life outwardly like your own, havea life within life--dissimilar--unsearchable--unguessed!\'Will you that I should sing of love?\' said she, fixing those eyes uponGlaucus.\'Yes,\' replied he, looking down.She moved a little way from the arm of Ione, still cast round her, as ifthat soft embrace embarrassed; and placing her light and gracefulinstrument on her knee, after a short prelude, she sang the followingstrain:               NYDIA\'S LOVE-SONG                     I         The Wind and the Beam loved the Rose,           And the Rose loved one;          For who recks the wind where it blows?          Or loves not the sun?                     II         None knew whence the humble Wind stole,           Poor sport of the skies--         None dreamt that the Wind had a soul,           In its mournful sighs!                    III         Oh, happy Beam! how canst thou prove           That bright love of thine?          In thy light is the proof of thy love.           Thou hast but--to shine!                     IV         How its love can the Wind reveal?           Unwelcome its sigh;          Mute--mute to its Rose let it steal--          Its proof is--to die!\'Thou singest but sadly, sweet girl,\' said Glaucus; \'thy youth onlyfeels as yet the dark shadow of Love; far other inspiration doth hewake, when he himself bursts and brightens upon us.\'I sing as I was taught,\' replied Nydia, sighing.\'Thy master was love-crossed, then--try thy hand at a gayer air. Nay,girl, give the instrument to me.\' As Nydia obeyed, her hand touched his,and, with that slight touch, her breast heaved--her cheek flushed.  Ioneand Glaucus, occupied with each other, perceived not those signs ofstrange and premature emotions, which preyed upon a heart that,nourished by imagination, dispensed with hope.And now, broad, blue, bright, before them, spread that halcyon sea, fairas at this moment, seventeen centuries from that date, I behold itrippling on the same divinest shores.  Clime that yet enervates with asoft and Circean spell--that moulds us insensibly, mysteriously, intoharmony with thyself, banishing the thought of austerer labor, thevoices of wild ambition, the contests and the roar of life; filling uswith gentle and subduing dreams, making necessary to our nature thatwhich is its least earthly portion, so that the very air inspires uswith the yearning and thirst of love. Whoever visits thee seems to leaveearth and its harsh cares behind--to enter by the Ivory gate into theLand of Dreams.  The young and laughing Hours of the PRESENT--the Hours,those children of Saturn, which he hungers ever to devour, seem snatchedfrom his grasp.  The past--the future--are forgotten; we enjoy but thebreathing time. Flower of the world\'s garden--Fountain of Delight--Italyof Italy--beautiful, benign Campania!--vain were, indeed, the Titans, ifon this spot they yet struggled for another heaven!  Here, if God meantthis working-day life for a perpetual holiday, who would not sigh todwell for ever--asking nothing, hoping nothing, fearing nothing, whilethy skies shine over him--while thy seas sparkle at his feet--whilethine air brought him sweet messages from the violet and the orange--andwhile the heart, resigned to--beating with--but one emotion, could findthe lips and the eyes, which flatter it (vanity of vanities!) that lovecan defy custom, and be eternal?It was then in this clime--on those seas, that the Athenian gazed upon aface that might have suited the nymph, the spirit of the place: feedinghis eyes on the changeful roses of that softest cheek, happy beyond thehappiness of common life, loving, and knowing himself beloved.In the tale of human passion, in past ages, there is something ofinterest even in the remoteness of the time.  We love to feel within usthe bond which unites the most distant era--men, nations, customsperish; THE AFFECTIONS ARE IMMORTAL!--they are the sympathies whichunite the ceaseless generations.  The past lives again, when we lookupon its emotions--it lives in our own!  That which was, ever is!  Themagician\'s gift, that revives the dead--that animates the dust offorgotten graves, is not in the author\'s skill--it is in the heart ofthe reader!Still vainly seeking the eyes of Ione, as, half downcast, half averted,they shunned his own, the Athenian, in a low and soft voice, thusexpressed the feelings inspired by happier thoughts than those which hadcolored the song of Nydia. THE SONG OF GLAUCUS                    I   As the bark floateth on o\'er the summer-lit sea,    Floats my heart o\'er the deeps of its passion for thee;    All lost in the space, without terror it glides,    For bright with thy soul is the face of the tides.    Now heaving, now hush\'d, is that passionate ocean,    As it catches thy smile or thy sighs;    And the twin-stars that shine on the wanderer\'s devotion    Its guide and its god--are thine eyes!                    II   The bark may go down, should the cloud sweep above,    For its being is bound to the light of thy love.    As thy faith and thy smile are its life and its joy,    So thy frown or thy change are the storms that destroy.    Ah! sweeter to sink while the sky is serene,     If time hath a change for thy heart!    If to live be to weep over what thou hast been,     Let me die while I know what thou art!As the last words of the song trembled over the sea, Ione raised herlooks--they met those of her lover.  Happy Nydia!--happy in thyaffliction, that thou couldst not see that fascinated and charmed gaze,that said so much--that made the eye the voice of the soul--thatpromised the impossibility of change!But, though the Thessalian could not detect that gaze, she divined itsmeaning by their silence--by their sighs.  She pressed her hands lightlyacross her breast, as if to keep down its bitter and jealous thoughts;and then she hastened to speak--for that silence was intolerable to her.\'After all, O Glaucus!\' said she, \'there is nothing very mirthful inyour strain!\'\'Yet I meant it to be so, when I took up thy lyre, pretty one. Perhapshappiness will not permit us to be mirthful.\'\'How strange is it,\' said Ione, changing a conversation which oppressedher while it charmed--\'that for the last several days yonder cloud hashung motionless over Vesuvius!  Yet not indeed motionless, for sometimesit changes its form; and now methinks it looks like some vast giant,with an arm outstretched over the city.  Dost thou see the likeness--oris it only to my fancy?\'\'Fair Ione!  I see it also.  It is astonishingly distinct.  The giantseems seated on the brow of the mountain, the different shades of thecloud appear to form a white robe that sweeps over its vast breast andlimbs; it seems to gaze with a steady face upon the city below, to pointwith one hand, as thou sayest, over its glittering streets, and to raisethe other (dost thou note it?) towards the higher heaven. It is like theghost of some huge Titan brooding over the beautiful world he lost;sorrowful for the past--yet with something of menace for the future.\'\'Could that mountain have any connection with the last night\'searthquake? They say that, ages ago, almost in the earliest era oftradition, it gave forth fires as AEtna still.  Perhaps the flames yetlurk and dart beneath.\'\'It is possible,\' said Glaucus, musingly.\'Thou sayest thou art slow to believe in magic,\' said Nydia, suddenly.\'I have heard that a potent witch dwells amongst the scorched caverns ofthe mountain, and yon cloud may be the dim shadow of the demon sheconfers with.\'\'Thou art full of the romance of thy native Thessaly,\' said Glaucus;\'and a strange mixture of sense and all conflicting superstitions.\'\'We are ever superstitious in the dark,\' replied Nydia.  \'Tell me,\' sheadded, after a slight pause, \'tell me, O Glaucus! do all that arebeautiful resemble each other?  They say you are beautiful, and Ionealso.  Are your faces then the same?  I fancy not, yet it ought to beso.\'\'Fancy no such grievous wrong to Ione,\' answered Glaucus, laughing.\'But we do not, alas! resemble each other, as the homely and thebeautiful sometimes do.  Ione\'s hair is dark, mine light; Ione\'s eyesare--what color, Ione?  I cannot see, turn them to me.  Oh, are theyblack? no, they are too soft. Are they blue? no, they are too deep: theychange with every ray of the sun--I know not their color: but mine,sweet Nydia, are grey, and bright only when Ione shines on them!  Ione\'scheek is...\'\'I do not understand one word of thy description,\' interrupted Nydia,peevishly.  \'I comprehend only that you do not resemble each other, andI am glad of it.\'\'Why, Nydia?\' said Ione.Nydia colored slightly.  \'Because,\' she replied, coldly, \'I have alwaysimagined you under different forms, and one likes to know one is right.\'\'And what hast thou imagined Glaucus to resemble?\' asked Ione, softly.\'Music!\' replied Nydia, looking down.\'Thou art right,\' thought Ione.\'And what likeness hast thou ascribed to Ione?\'\'I cannot tell yet,\' answered the blind girl; \'I have not yet known herlong enough to find a shape and sign for my guesses.\'\'I will tell thee, then,\' said Glaucus, passionately; \'she is like thesun that warms--like the wave that refreshes.\'\'The sun sometimes scorches, and the wave sometimes drowns,\' answeredNydia.\'Take then these roses,\' said Glaucus; \'let their fragrance suggest tothee Ione.\'\'Alas, the roses will fade!\' said the Neapolitan, archly.Thus conversing, they wore away the hours; the lovers, conscious only ofthe brightness and smiles of love; the blind girl feeling only itsdarkness--its tortures--the fierceness of jealousy and its woe!And now, as they drifted on, Glaucus once more resumed the lyre, andwoke its strings with a careless hand to a strain, so wildly and gladlybeautiful, that even Nydia was aroused from her reverie, and uttered acry of admiration.\'Thou seest, my child,\' cried Glaucus, \'that I can yet redeem thecharacter of love\'s music, and that I was wrong in saying happinesscould not be gay. Listen, Nydia! listen, dear Ione! and hear:             THE BIRTH OF LOVE                    I         Like a Star in the seas above,             Like a Dream to the waves of sleep--        Up--up--THE INCARNATE LOVE--            She rose from the charmed deep!          And over the Cyprian Isle          The skies shed their silent smile;          And the Forest\'s green heart was rife          With the stir of the gushing life--         The life that had leap\'d to birth,          In the veins of the happy earth!                Hail! oh, hail!          The dimmest sea-cave below thee,             The farthest sky-arch above,          In their innermost stillness know thee:             And heave with the Birth of Love!                Gale! soft Gale!          Thou comest on thy silver winglets,             From thy home in the tender west,          Now fanning her golden ringlets,             Now hush\'d on her heaving breast.          And afar on the murmuring sand,          The Seasons wait hand in hand          To welcome thee, Birth Divine,          To the earth which is henceforth thine.                    II         Behold! how she kneels in the shell,          Bright pearl in its floating cell!          Behold! how the shell\'s rose-hues,             The cheek and the breast of snow,          And the delicate limbs suffuse,             Like a blush, with a bashful glow.          Sailing on, slowly sailing             O\'er the wild water;          All hail! as the fond light is hailing             Her daughter,                   All hail!          We are thine, all thine evermore:          Not a leaf on the laughing shore,          Not a wave on the heaving sea,             Nor a single sigh             In the boundless sky,          But is vow\'d evermore to thee!                   III         And thou, my beloved one--thou,           As I gaze on thy soft eyes now,          Methinks from their depths I view          The Holy Birth born anew;          Thy lids are the gentle cell             Where the young Love blushing lies;          See! she breaks from the mystic shell,             She comes from thy tender eyes!                Hail! all hail!          She comes, as she came from the sea,          To my soul as it looks on thee;             She comes, she comes!          She comes, as she came from the sea,          To my soul as it looks on thee!                Hail! all hail!Chapter IIITHE CONGREGATION.FOLLOWED by Apaecides, the Nazarene gained the side of the Sarnus--thatriver, which now has shrunk into a petty stream, then rushed gaily intothe sea, covered with countless vessels, and reflecting on its waves thegardens, the vines, the palaces, and the temples of Pompeii.  From itsmore noisy and frequented banks, Olinthus directed his steps to a pathwhich ran amidst a shady vista of trees, at the distance of a few pacesfrom the river.  This walk was in the evening a favorite resort of thePompeians, but during the heat and business of the day was seldomvisited, save by some groups of playful children, some meditative poet,or some disputative philosophers.  At the side farthest from the river,frequent copses of box interspersed the more delicate and evanescentfoliage, and these were cut into a thousand quaint shapes, sometimesinto the forms of fauns and satyrs, sometimes into the mimicry ofEgyptian pyramids, sometimes into the letters that composed the name ofa popular or eminent citizen.  Thus the false taste is equally ancientas the pure; and the retired traders of Hackney and Paddington, acentury ago, were little aware, perhaps, that in their tortured yews andsculptured box, they found their models in the most polished period ofRoman antiquity, in the gardens of Pompeii, and the villas of thefastidious Pliny.This walk now, as the noonday sun shone perpendicularly through thechequered leaves, was entirely deserted; at least no other forms thanthose of Olinthus and the priest infringed upon the solitude. They satthemselves on one of the benches, placed at intervals between the trees,and facing the faint breeze that came languidly from the river, whosewaves danced and sparkled before them--a singular and contrasted pair;the believer in the latest--the priest of the most ancient--worship ofthe world!\'Since thou leftst me so abruptly,\' said Olinthus, \'hast thou beenhappy? has thy heart found contentment under these priestly robes? hastthou, still yearning for the voice of God, heard it whisper comfort tothee from the oracles of Isis?  That sigh, that averted countenance,give me the answer my soul predicted.\'\'Alas!\' answered Apaecides, sadly, \'thou seest before thee a wretchedand distracted man!  From my childhood upward I have idolized the dreamsof virtue!  I have envied the holiness of men who, in caves and lonelytemples, have been admitted to the companionship of beings above theworld; my days have been consumed with feverish and vague desires; mynights with mocking but solemn visions.  Seduced by the mysticprophecies of an impostor, I have indued these robes;--my nature (Iconfess it to thee frankly)--my nature has revolted at what I have seenand been doomed to share in! Searching after truth, I have become butthe minister of falsehoods. On the evening in which we last met, I wasbuoyed by hopes created by that same impostor, whom I ought already tohave better known.  I have--no matter--no matter! suffice it, I haveadded perjury and sin to rashness and to sorrow.  The veil is now rentfor ever from my eyes; I behold a villain where I obeyed a demigod; theearth darkens in my sight; I am in the deepest abyss of gloom; I knownot if there be gods above; if we are the things of chance; if beyondthe bounded and melancholy present there is annihilation or anhereafter--tell me, then, thy faith; solve me these doubts, if thou hastindeed the power!\'\'I do not marvel,\' answered the Nazarene, \'that thou hast thus erred, orthat thou art thus sceptic.  Eighty years ago there was no assurance toman of God, or of a certain and definite future beyond the grave.  Newlaws are declared to him who has ears--a heaven, a true Olympus, isrevealed to him who has eyes--heed then, and listen.\'And with all the earnestness of a man believing ardently himself, andzealous to convert, the Nazarene poured forth to Apaecides theassurances of Scriptural promise.  He spoke first of the sufferings andmiracles of Christ--he wept as he spoke: he turned next to the gloriesof the Saviour\'s Ascension--to the clear predictions of Revelation.  Hedescribed that pure and unsensual heaven destined to the virtuous--thosefires and torments that were the doom of guilt.The doubts which spring up to the mind of later reasoners, in theimmensity of the sacrifice of God to man, were not such as would occurto an early heathen.  He had been accustomed to believe that the godshad lived upon earth, and taken upon themselves the forms of men; hadshared in human passions, in human labours, and in human misfortunes.What was the travail of his own Alcmena\'s son, whose altars now smokedwith the incense of countless cities, but a toil for the human race?Had not the great Dorian Apollo expiated a mystic sin by descending tothe grave?  Those who were the deities of heaven had been the lawgiversor benefactors on earth, and gratitude had led to worship.  It seemedtherefore, to the heathen, a doctrine neither new nor strange, thatChrist had been sent from heaven, that an immortal had indued mortality,and tasted the bitterness of death. And the end for which He thus toiledand thus suffered--how far more glorious did it seem to Apaecides thanthat for which the deities of old had visited the nether world, andpassed through the gates of death!  Was it not worthy of a God todescend to these dim valleys, in order to clear up the clouds gatheredover the dark mount beyond--to satisfy the doubts of sages--to convertspeculation into certainty--by example to point out the rules oflife--by revelation to solve the enigma of the grave--and to prove thatthe soul did not yearn in vain when it dreamed of an immortality?  Inthis last was the great argument of those lowly men destined to convertthe earth.  As nothing is more flattering to the pride and the hopes ofman than the belief in a future state, so nothing could be more vagueand confused than the notions of the heathen sages upon that mysticsubject. Apaecides had already learned that the faith of thephilosophers was not that of the herd; that if they secretly professed acreed in some diviner power, it was not the creed which they thought itwise to impart to the community.  He had already learned, that even thepriest ridiculed what he preached to the people--that the notions of thefew and the many were never united.  But, in this new faith, it seemedto him that philosopher, priest, and people, the expounders of thereligion and its followers, were alike accordant: they did not speculateand debate upon immortality, they spoke of as a thing certain andassured; the magnificence of the promise dazzled him--its consolationssoothed. For the Christian faith made its early converts among sinners!many of its fathers and its martyrs were those who had felt thebitterness of vice, and who were therefore no longer tempted by itsfalse aspect from the paths of an austere and uncompromising virtue.All the assurances of this healing faith invited to repentance--theywere peculiarly adapted to the bruised and sore of spirit! the veryremorse which Apaecides felt for his late excesses, made him incline toone who found holiness in that remorse, and who whispered of the joy inheaven over one sinner that repenteth.\'Come,\' said the Nazarene, as he perceived the effect he had produced,\'come to the humble hall in which we meet--a select and a chosen few;listen there to our prayers; note the sincerity of our repentant tears;mingle in our simple sacrifice--not of victims, nor of garlands, butoffered by white-robed thoughts upon the altar of the heart.  Theflowers that we lay there are imperishable--they bloom over us when weare no more; nay, they accompany us beyond the grave, they spring upbeneath our feet in heaven, they delight us with an eternal odor, forthey are of the soul, they partake of its nature; these offerings aretemptations overcome, and sins repented. Come, oh come! lose not anothermoment; prepare already for the great, the awful journey, from darknessto light, from sorrow to bliss, from corruption to immortality!  This isthe day of the Lord the Son, a day that we have set apart for ourdevotions.  Though we meet usually at night, yet some amongst us aregathered together even now.  What joy, what triumph, will be with usall, if we can bring one stray lamb into the sacred fold!\'There seemed to Apaecides, so naturally pure of heart, somethingineffably generous and benign in that spirit of conversation whichanimated Olinthus--a spirit that found its own bliss in the happiness ofothers--that sought in its wide sociality to make companions foreternity.  He was touched, softened, and subdued.  He was not in thatmood which can bear to be left alone; curiosity, too, mingled with hispurer stimulants--he was anxious to see those rites of which so manydark and contradictory rumours were afloat.  He paused a moment, lookedover his garb, thought of Arbaces, shuddered with horror, lifted hiseyes to the broad brow of the Nazarene, intent, anxious, watchful--butfor his benefits, for his salvation!  He drew his cloak round him, so aswholly to conceal his robes, and said, \'Lead on, I follow thee.\'Olinthus pressed his hand joyfully, and then descending to the riverside, hailed one of the boats that plyed there constantly; they enteredit; an awning overhead, while it sheltered them from the sun, screenedalso their persons from observation: they rapidly skimmed the wave.From one of the boats that passed them floated a soft music, and itsprow was decorated with flowers--it was gliding towards the sea.\'So,\' said Olinthus, sadly, \'unconscious and mirthful in theirdelusions, sail the votaries of luxury into the great ocean of storm andshipwreck! we pass them, silent and unnoticed, to gain the land.\'Apaecides, lifting his eyes, caught through the aperture in the awning aglimpse of the face of one of the inmates of that gay bark--it was theface of Ione.  The lovers were embarked on the excursion at which wehave been made present.  The priest sighed, and once more sunk back uponhis seat. They reached the shore where, in the suburbs, an alley ofsmall and mean houses stretched towards the bank; they dismissed theboat, landed, and Olinthus, preceding the priest, threaded the labyrinthof lanes, and arrived at last at the closed door of a habitationsomewhat larger than its neighbors.  He knocked thrice--the door wasopened and closed again, as Apaecides followed his guide across thethreshold.They passed a deserted atrium, and gained an inner chamber of moderatesize, which, when the door was closed, received its only light from asmall window cut over the door itself.  But, halting at the threshold ofthis chamber, and knocking at the door, Olinthus said, \'Peace be withyou!\' A voice from within returned, \'Peace with whom?\' \'The Faithful!\'answered Olinthus, and the door opened; twelve or fourteen persons weresitting in a semicircle, silent, and seemingly absorbed in thought, andopposite to a crucifix rudely carved in wood.They lifted up their eyes when Olinthus entered, without speaking; theNazarene himself, before he accosted them, knelt suddenly down, and byhis moving lips, and his eyes fixed steadfastly on the crucifix,Apaecides saw that he prayed inly.  This rite performed, Olinthus turnedto the congregation--\'Men and brethren,\' said he, \'start not to beholdamongst you a priest of Isis; he hath sojourned with the blind, but theSpirit hath fallen on him--he desires to see, to hear, and tounderstand.\'\'Let him,\' said one of the assembly; and Apaecides beheld in the speakera man still younger than himself, of a countenance equally worn andpallid, of an eye which equally spoke of the restless and fieryoperations of a working mind.\'Let him,\' repeated a second voice, and he who thus spoke was in theprime of manhood; his bronzed skin and Asiatic features bespoke him ason of Syria--he had been a robber in his youth.\'Let him,\' said a third voice; and the priest, again turning to regardthe speaker, saw an old man with a long grey beard, whom he recognizedas a slave to the wealthy Diomed.\'Let him,\' repeated simultaneously the rest--men who, with twoexceptions, were evidently of the inferior ranks.  In these exceptions,Apaecides noted an officer of the guard, and an Alexandrian merchant.\'We do not,\' recommenced Olinthus--\'we do not bind you to secrecy; weimpose on you no oaths (as some of our weaker brethren would do) not tobetray us. It is true, indeed, that there is no absolute law against us;but the multitude, more savage than their rulers, thirst for our lives.So, my friends, when Pilate would have hesitated, it was the people whoshouted ""Christ to the cross!"" But we bind you not to our safety--no!Betray us to the crowd--impeach, calumniate, malign us if you will--weare above death, we should walk cheerfully to the den of the lion, orthe rack of the torturer--we can trample down the darkness of the grave,and what is death to a criminal is eternity to the Christian.\'A low and applauding murmur ran through the assembly.\'Thou comest amongst us as an examiner, mayest thou remain a convert!Our religion? you behold it!  Yon cross our sole image, yon scroll themysteries of our Caere and Eleusis!  Our morality? it is in ourlives!--sinners we all have been; who now can accuse us of a crime? wehave baptized ourselves from the past.  Think not that this is of us, itis of God.  Approach, Medon,\' beckoning to the old slave who had spokenthird for the admission of Apaecides, \'thou art the sole man amongst uswho is not free.  But in heaven, the last shall be first: so with us.Unfold your scroll, read and explain.\'Useless would it be for us to accompany the lecture of Medon, or thecomments of the congregation.  Familiar now are those doctrines, thenstrange and new.  Eighteen centuries have left us little to expound uponthe lore of Scripture or the life of Christ.  To us, too, there wouldseem little congenial in the doubts that occurred to a heathen priest,and little learned in the answers they receive from men uneducated,rude, and simple, possessing only the knowledge that they were greaterthan they seemed.There was one thing that greatly touched the Neapolitan: when thelecture was concluded, they heard a very gentle knock at the door; thepassword was given, and replied to; the door opened, and two youngchildren, the eldest of whom might have told its seventh year, enteredtimidly; they were the children of the master of the house, that darkand hardy Syrian, whose youth had been spent in pillage and bloodshed.The eldest of the congregation (it was that old slave) opened to themhis arms; they fled to the shelter--they crept to his breast--and hishard features smiled as he caressed them.  And then these bold andfervent men, nursed in vicissitude, beaten by the rough winds oflife--men of mailed and impervious fortitude, ready to affront a world,prepared for torment and armed for death--men, who presented allimaginable contrast to the weak nerves, the light hearts, the tenderfragility of childhood, crowded round the infants, smoothing theirrugged brows and composing their bearded lips to kindly and fosteringsmiles: and then the old man opened the scroll and he taught the infantsto repeat after him that beautiful prayer which we still dedicate to theLord, and still teach to our children; and then he told them, in simplephrase, of God\'s love to the young, and how not a sparrow falls but Hiseye sees it.  This lovely custom of infant initiation was long cherishedby the early Church, in memory of the words which said, \'Suffer littlechildren to come unto me, and forbid them not\'; and was perhaps theorigin of the superstitious calumny which ascribed to the Nazarenes thecrime which the Nazarenes, when victorious, attributed to the Jew, viz.the decoying children to hideous rites, at which they were secretlyimmolated.And the stern paternal penitent seemed to feel in the innocence of hischildren a return into early life--life ere yet it sinned: he followedthe motion of their young lips with an earnest gaze; he smiled as theyrepeated, with hushed and reverent looks, the holy words: and when thelesson was done, and they ran, released, and gladly to his knee, heclasped them to his breast, kissed them again and again, and tearsflowed fast down his cheek--tears, of which it would have beenimpossible to trace the source, so mingled they were with joy andsorrow, penitence and hope--remorse for himself and love for them!Something, I say, there was in this scene which peculiarly affectedApaecides; and, in truth, it is difficult to conceive a ceremony moreappropriate to the religion of benevolence, more appealing to thehousehold and everyday affections, striking a more sensitive chord inthe human breast.It was at this time that an inner door opened gently, and a very old manentered the chamber, leaning on a staff.  At his presence, the wholecongregation rose; there was an expression of deep, affectionate respectupon every countenance; and Apaecides, gazing on his countenance, feltattracted towards him by an irresistible sympathy.  No man ever lookedupon that face without love; for there had dwelt the smile of the Deity,the incarnation of divinest love--and the glory of the smile had neverpassed away.\'My children, God be with you!\' said the old man, stretching his arms;and as he spoke the infants ran to his knee.  He sat down, and theynestled fondly to his bosom.  It was beautiful to see that mingling ofthe extremes of life--the rivers gushing from their early source--themajestic stream gliding to the ocean of eternity!  As the light ofdeclining day seems to mingle earth and heaven, making the outline ofeach scarce visible, and blending the harsh mountain-tops with the sky,even so did the smile of that benign old age appear to hallow the aspectof those around, to blend together the strong distinctions of varyingyears, and to diffuse over infancy and manhood the light of that heaveninto which it must so soon vanish and be lost.\'Father,\' said Olinthus, \'thou on whose form the miracle of the Redeemerworked; thou who wert snatched from the grave to become the livingwitness of His mercy and His power; behold! a stranger in our meeting--anew lamb gathered to the fold!\'\'Let me bless him,\' said the old man: the throng gave way. Apaecidesapproached him as by an instinct: he fell on his knees before him--theold man laid his hand on the priest\'s head, and blessed him, but notaloud.  As his lips moved, his eyes were upturned, and tears--thosetears that good men only shed in the hope of happiness toanother--flowed fast down his cheeks.The children were on either side of the convert; his heart wastheirs--he had become as one of them--to enter into the kingdom ofHeaven.Chapter IVTHE STREAM OF LOVE RUNS ON.  WHITHER?DAYS are like years in the love of the young, when no bar, no obstacle,is between their hearts--when the sun shines, and the course runssmooth--when their love is prosperous and confessed.  Ione no longerconcealed from Glaucus the attachment she felt for him, and their talknow was only of their love.  Over the rapture of the present the hopesof the future glowed like the heaven above the gardens of spring.  Theywent in their trustful thoughts far down the stream of time: they laidout the chart of their destiny to come; they suffered the light ofto-day to suffuse the morrow. In the youth of their hearts it seemed asif care, and change, and death, were as things unknown.  Perhaps theyloved each other the more because the condition of the world left toGlaucus no aim and no wish but love; because the distractions common infree states to men\'s affections existed not for the Athenian; becausehis country wooed him not to the bustle of civil life; because ambitionfurnished no counterpoise to love: and, therefore, over their schemesand projects, love only reigned.  In the iron age they imaginedthemselves of the golden, doomed only to live and to love.To the superficial observer, who interests himself only in charactersstrongly marked and broadly colored, both the lovers may seem of tooslight and commonplace a mould: in the delineation of characterspurposely subdued, the reader sometimes imagines that there is a want ofcharacter; perhaps, indeed, I wrong the real nature of these two loversby not painting more impressively their stronger individualities.  Butin dwelling so much on their bright and birdlike existence, I aminfluenced almost insensibly by the forethought of the changes thatawait them, and for which they were so ill prepared.  It was this verysoftness and gaiety of life that contrasted most strongly thevicissitudes of their coming fate.  For the oak without fruit orblossom, whose hard and rugged heart is fitted for the storm, there isless fear than for the delicate branches of the myrtle, and the laughingclusters of the vine.They had now advanced far into August--the next month their marriage wasfixed, and the threshold of Glaucus was already wreathed with garlands;and nightly, by the door of Ione, he poured forth the rich libations.He existed no longer for his gay companions; he was ever with Ione.  Inthe mornings they beguiled the sun with music: in the evenings theyforsook the crowded haunts of the gay for excursions on the water, oralong the fertile and vine-clad plains that lay beneath the fatal mountof Vesuvius.  The earth shook no more; the lively Pompeians forgot eventhat there had gone forth so terrible a warning of their approachingdoom.  Glaucus imagined that convulsion, in the vanity of his heathenreligion, an especial interposition of the gods, less in behalf of hisown safety than that of Ione.  He offered up the sacrifices of gratitudeat the temples of his faith; and even the altar of Isis was covered withhis votive garlands--as to the prodigy of the animated marble, heblushed at the effect it had produced on him.  He believed it, indeed,to have been wrought by the magic of man; but the result convinced himthat it betokened not the anger of a goddess.Of Arbaces, they heard only that he still lived; stretched on the bed ofsuffering, he recovered slowly from the effect of the shock he hadsustained--he left the lovers unmolested--but it was only to brood overthe hour and the method of revenge.Alike in their mornings at the house of Ione, and in their eveningexcursions, Nydia was usually their constant, and often their solecompanion.  They did not guess the secret fires which consumed her--theabrupt freedom with which she mingled in their conversation--hercapricious and often her peevish moods found ready indulgence in therecollection of the service they owed her, and their compassion for heraffliction.  They felt an interest in her, perhaps the greater and moreaffectionate from the very strangeness and waywardness of her nature,her singular alternations of passion and softness--the mixture ofignorance and genius--of delicacy and rudeness--of the quick humors ofthe child, and the proud calmness of the woman.  Although she refused toaccept of freedom, she was constantly suffered to be free; she wentwhere she listed; no curb was put either on her words or actions; theyfelt for one so darkly fated, and so susceptible of every wound, thesame pitying and compliant indulgence the mother feels for a spoiled andsickly child--dreading to impose authority, even where they imagined itfor her benefit.  She availed herself of this license by refusing thecompanionship of the slave whom they wished to attend her. With theslender staff by which she guided her steps, she went now, as in herformer unprotected state, along the populous streets: it was almostmiraculous to perceive how quickly and how dexterously she threadedevery crowd, avoiding every danger, and could find her benighted waythrough the most intricate windings of the city.  But her chief delightwas still in visiting the few feet of ground which made the garden ofGlaucus--in tending the flowers that at least repaid her love.Sometimes she entered the chamber where he sat, and sought aconversation, which she nearly always broke off abruptly--forconversation with Glaucus only tended to one subject--Ione; and thatname from his lips inflicted agony upon her.  Often she bitterlyrepented the service she had rendered to Ione: often she said inly, \'Ifshe had fallen, Glaucus could have loved her no longer\'; and then darkand fearful thoughts crept into her breast.She had not experienced fully the trials that were in store for her,when she had been thus generous.  She had never before been present whenGlaucus and Ione were together; she had never heard that voice so kindto her, so much softer to another.  The shock that crushed her heartwith the tidings that Glaucus loved, had at first only saddened andbenumbed--by degrees jealousy took a wilder and fiercer shape; itpartook of hatred--it whispered revenge.  As you see the wind onlyagitate the green leaf upon the bough, while the leaf which has lainwithered and seared on the ground, bruised and trampled upon till thesap and life are gone, is suddenly whirled aloft--now here--nowthere--without stay and without rest; so the love which visits the happyand the hopeful hath but freshness on its wings! its violence is butsportive.  But the heart that hath fallen from the green things of life,that is without hope, that hath no summer in its fibres, is torn andwhirled by the same wind that but caresses its brethren--it hath nobough to cling to--it is dashed from path to path--till the winds fall,and it is crushed into the mire for ever.The friendless childhood of Nydia had hardened prematurely hercharacter; perhaps the heated scenes of profligacy through which she hadpassed, seemingly unscathed, had ripened her passions, though they hadnot sullied her purity.  The orgies of Burbo might only have disgusted,the banquets of the Egyptian might only have terrified, at the moment;but the winds that pass unheeded over the soil leave seeds behind them.As darkness, too, favors the imagination, so, perhaps, her veryblindness contributed to feed with wild and delirious visions the loveof the unfortunate girl.  The voice of Glaucus had been the first thathad sounded musically to her ear; his kindness made a deep impressionupon her mind; when he had left Pompeii in the former year, she hadtreasured up in her heart every word he had uttered; and when any onetold her that this friend and patron of the poor flower-girl was themost brilliant and the most graceful of the young revellers of Pompeii,she had felt a pleasing pride in nursing his recollection.  Even thetask which she imposed upon herself, of tending his flowers, served tokeep him in her mind; she associated him with all that was most charmingto her impressions; and when she had refused to express what image shefancied Ione to resemble, it was partly, perhaps, that whatever wasbright and soft in nature she had already combined with the thought ofGlaucus.  If any of my readers ever loved at an age which they would nowsmile to remember--an age in which fancy forestalled the reason, letthem say whether that love, among all its strange and complicateddelicacies, was not, above all other and later passions, susceptible ofjealousy? I seek not here the cause: I know that it is commonly thefact.When Glaucus returned to Pompeii, Nydia had told another year of life;that year, with its sorrows, its loneliness, its trials, had greatlydeveloped her mind and heart; and when the Athenian drew herunconsciously to his breast, deeming her still in soul as in years achild--when he kissed her smooth cheek, and wound his arm round hertrembling frame, Nydia felt suddenly, and as by revelation, that thosefeelings she had long and innocently cherished were of love.  Doomed tobe rescued from tyranny by Glaucus--doomed to take shelter under hisroof--doomed to breathe, but for so brief a time, the same air--anddoomed, in the first rush of a thousand happy, grateful, delicioussentiments of an overflowing heart, to hear that he loved another; to becommissioned to that other, the messenger, the minister; to feel all atonce that utter nothingness which she was--which she ever must be, butwhich, till then, her young mind had not taught her--that utternothingness to him who was all to her; what wonder that, in her wild andpassionate soul, all the elements jarred discordant; that if lovereigned over the whole, it was not the love which is born of the moresacred and soft emotions?  Sometimes she dreaded only lest Glaucusshould discover her secret; sometimes she felt indignant that it was notsuspected: it was a sign of contempt--could he imagine that she presumedso far?  Her feelings to Ione ebbed and flowed with every hour; now sheloved her because he did; now she hated him for the same cause.  Therewere moments when she could have murdered her unconscious mistress;moments when she could have laid down life for her.  These fierce andtremulous alternations of passion were too severe to be borne long.  Herhealth gave way, though she felt it not--her cheek paled--her step grewfeebler--tears came to her eyes more often, and relieved her less.One morning, when she repaired to her usual task in the garden of theAthenian, she found Glaucus under the columns of the peristyle, with amerchant of the town; he was selecting jewels for his destined bride.He had already fitted up her apartment; the jewels he bought that daywere placed also within it--they were never fated to grace the fair formof Ione; they may be seen at this day among the disinterred treasures ofPompeii, in the chambers of the studio at Naples.\'Come hither, Nydia; put down thy vase, and come hither.  Thou must takethis chain from me--stay--there, I have put it on.  There, Servilius,does it not become her?\'\'Wonderfully!\' answered the jeweller; for jewellers were well-bred andflattering men, even at that day.  \'But when these ear-rings glitter inthe ears of the noble Ione, then, by Bacchus! you will see whether myart adds anything to beauty.\'\'Ione?\' repeated Nydia, who had hitherto acknowledged by smiles andblushes the gift of Glaucus.\'Yes,\' replied the Athenian, carelessly toying with the gems; \'I amchoosing a present for Ione, but there are none worthy of her.\'He was startled as he spoke by an abrupt gesture of Nydia; she tore thechain violently from her neck, and dashed it on the ground.\'How is this?  What, Nydia, dost thou not like the bauble? art thouoffended?\'\'You treat me ever as a slave and as a child,\' replied the Thessalian,with ill-suppressed sobs, and she turned hastily away to the oppositecorner of the garden.Glaucus did not attempt to follow, or to soothe; he was offended; hecontinued to examine the jewels and to comment on their fashion--toobject to this and to praise that, and finally to be talked by themerchant into buying all; the safest plan for a lover, and a plan thatany one will do right to adopt, provided always that he can obtain anIone!When he had completed his purchase and dismissed the jeweller, heretired into his chamber, dressed, mounted his chariot, and went toIone.  He thought no more of the blind girl, or her offence; he hadforgotten both the one and the other.He spent the forenoon with his beautiful Neapolitan, repaired thence tothe baths, supped (if, as we have said before, we can justly sotranslate the three o\'clock coena of the Romans) alone, and abroad, forPompeii had its restaurateurs--and returning home to change his dressere he again repaired to the house of Ione, he passed the peristyle, butwith the absorbed reverie and absent eyes of a man in love, and did notnote the form of the poor blind girl, bending exactly in the same placewhere he had left her.  But though he saw her not, her ear recognized atonce the sound of his step. She had been counting the moments to hisreturn.  He had scarcely entered his favorite chamber, which opened onthe peristyle, and seated himself musingly on his couch, when he felthis robe timorously touched, and, turning, he beheld Nydia kneelingbefore him, and holding up to him a handful of flowers--a gentle andappropriate peace-offering--her eyes, darkly upheld to his own, streamedwith tears.\'I have offended thee,\' said she, sobbing, \'and for the first time.  Iwould die rather than cause thee a moment\'s pain--say that thou wiltforgive me. See! I have taken up the chain; I have put it on: I willnever part from it--it is thy gift.\'\'My dear Nydia,\' returned Glaucus, and raising her, he kissed herforehead, \'think of it no more!  But why, my child, wert thou sosuddenly angry?  I could not divine the cause?\'\'Do not ask!\' said she, coloring violently.  \'I am a thing full offaults and humors; you know I am but a child--you say so often: is itfrom a child that you can expect a reason for every folly?\'\'But, prettiest, you will soon be a child no more; and if you would haveus treat you as a woman, you must learn to govern these singularimpulses and gales of passion.  Think not I chide: no, it is for yourhappiness only I speak.\'\'It is true,\' said Nydia, \'I must learn to govern myself I must bide, Imust suppress, my heart.  This is a woman\'s task and duty; methinks hervirtue is hypocrisy.\'\'Self-control is not deceit, my Nydia,\' returned the Athenian; \'and thatis the virtue necessary alike to man and to woman; it is the truesenatorial toga, the badge of the dignity it covers!\'\'Self-control! self-control!  Well, well, what you say is right! When Ilisten to you, Glaucus, my wildest thoughts grow calm and sweet, and adelicious serenity falls over me.  Advise, ah! guide me ever, mypreserver!\'\'Thy affectionate heart will be thy best guide, Nydia, when thou hastlearned to regulate its feelings.\'\'Ah! that will be never,\' sighed Nydia, wiping away her tears.\'Say not so: the first effort is the only difficult one.\'\'I have made many first efforts,\' answered Nydia, innocently.  \'But you,my Mentor, do you find it so easy to control yourself?  Can you conceal,can you even regulate, your love for Ione?\'\'Love! dear Nydia: ah! that is quite another matter,\' answered the youngpreceptor.\'I thought so!\' returned Nydia, with a melancholy smile.  \'Glaucus, wiltthou take my poor flowers?  Do with them as thou wilt--thou canst givethem to Ione,\' added she, with a little hesitation.\'Nay, Nydia,\' answered Glaucus, kindly, divining something of jealousyin her language, though he imagined it only the jealousy of a vain andsusceptible child; \'I will not give thy pretty flowers to any one.  Sithere and weave them into a garland; I will wear it this night: it is notthe first those delicate fingers have woven for me.\'The poor girl delightedly sat down beside Glaucus.  She drew from hergirdle a ball of the many-colored threads, or rather slender ribands,used in the weaving of garlands, and which (for it was her professionaloccupation) she carried constantly with her, and began quickly andgracefully to commence her task.  Upon her young cheeks the tears werealready dried, a faint but happy smile played round her lips--childlike,indeed, she was sensible only of the joy of the present hour: she wasreconciled to Glaucus: he had forgiven her--she was beside him--heplayed caressingly with her silken hair--his breath fanned hercheek--Ione, the cruel Ione, was not by--none other demanded, divided,his care.  Yes, she was happy and forgetful; it was one of the fewmoments in her brief and troubled life that it was sweet to treasure, torecall. As the butterfly, allured by the winter sun, basks for a littlein the sudden light, ere yet the wind awakes and the frost comes on,which shall blast it before the eve--she rested beneath a beam, which,by contrast with the wonted skies, was not chilling; and the instinctwhich should have warned her of its briefness, bade her only gladden inits smile.\'Thou hast beautiful locks,\' said Glaucus.  \'They were once, I weenwell, a mother\'s delight.\'Nydia sighed; it would seem that she had not been born a slave; but sheever shunned the mention of her parentage, and, whether obscure ornoble, certain it is that her birth was never known by her benefactors,nor by any one in those distant shores, even to the last.  The child ofsorrow and of mystery, she came and went as some bird that enters ourchamber for a moment; we see it flutter for a while before us, we knownot whence it flew or to what region it escapes.Nydia sighed, and after a short pause, without answering the remark,said: \'But do I weave too many roses in my wreath, Glaucus?  They tellme it is thy favorite flower.\'\'And ever favored, my Nydia, be it by those who have the soul of poetry:it is the flower of love, of festival; it is also the flower we dedicateto silence and to death; it blooms on our brows in life, while life beworth the having; it is scattered above our sepulchre when we are nomore.\'\'Ah! would,\' said Nydia, \'instead of this perishable wreath, that Icould take thy web from the hand of the Fates, and insert the rosesthere!\'\'Pretty one! thy wish is worthy of a voice so attuned to song; it isuttered in the spirit of song; and, whatever my doom, I thank thee.\'\'Whatever thy doom! is it not already destined to all things bright andfair?  My wish was vain.  The Fates will be as tender to thee as Ishould.\'\'It might not be so, Nydia, were it not for love!  While youth lasts, Imay forget my country for a while.  But what Athenian, in his gravermanhood, can think of Athens as she was, and be contented that he ishappy, while she is fallen?--fallen, and for ever?\'\'And why for ever?\'\'As ashes cannot be rekindled--as love once dead can never revive, sofreedom departed from a people is never regained.  But talk we not ofthese matters unsuited to thee.\'\'To me, oh! thou errest.  I, too, have my sighs for Greece; my cradlewas rocked at the foot of Olympus; the gods have left the mountain, buttheir traces may be seen--seen in the hearts of their worshippers, seenin the beauty of their clime: they tell me it is beautiful, and I havefelt its airs, to which even these are harsh--its sun, to which theseskies are chill.  Oh! talk to me of Greece! Poor fool that I am, I cancomprehend thee! and methinks, had I yet lingered on those shores, had Ibeen a Grecian maid whose happy fate it was to love and to be loved, Imyself could have armed my lover for another Marathon, a new Plataea.Yes, the hand that now weaves the roses should have woven thee the olivecrown!\'\'If such a day could come!\' said Glaucus, catching the enthusiasm of theblind Thessalian, and half rising.--\'But no! the sun has set, and thenight only bids us be forgetful--and in forgetfulness be gay--weavestill the roses!\'But it was with a melancholy tone of forced gaiety that the Athenianuttered the last words: and sinking into a gloomy reverie, he was onlywakened from it, a few minutes afterwards, by the voice of Nydia, as shesang in a low tone the following words, which he had once taught her:--           THE APOLOGY FOR PLEASURE                    I           Who will assume the bays              That the hero wore?           Wreaths on the Tomb of Days              Gone evermore!           Who shall disturb the brave,           Or one leaf on their holy grave?           The laurel is vowed to them,           Leave the bay on its sacred stem!              But this, the rose, the fading rose,              Alike for slave and freeman grows.                    II           If Memory sit beside the dead              With tombs her only treasure;           If Hope is lost and Freedom fled,              The more excuse for Pleasure.           Come, weave the wreath, the roses weave,              The rose at least is ours:           To feeble hearts our fathers leave,              In pitying scorn, the flowers!                    III             On the summit, worn and hoary,           Of Phyle\'s solemn hill,           The tramp of the brave is still!           And still in the saddening Mart,           The pulse of that mighty heart,              Whose very blood was glory!           Glaucopis forsakes her own,              The angry gods forget us;           But yet, the blue streams along,           Walk the feet of the silver Song;           And the night-bird wakes the moon;           And the bees in the blushing noon              Haunt the heart of the old Hymettus.           We are fallen, but not forlorn,              If something is left to cherish;           As Love was the earliest born,              So Love is the last to perish.                    IV           Wreathe then the roses, wreathe              The BEAUTIFUL still is ours,           While the stream shall flow and the sky shall glow,           The BEAUTIFUL still is ours!           Whatever is fair, or soft, or bright,           In the lap of day or the arms of night,           Whispers our soul of Greece--of Greece,           And hushes our care with a voice of peace.              Wreathe then the roses, wreathe!              They tell me of earlier hours;           And I hear the heart of my Country breathe              From the lips of the Stranger\'s flowers.Chapter VNYDIA ENCOUNTERS JULIA.  INTERVIEW OF THE HEATHEN SISTER AND CONVERTEDBROTHER.  AN ATHENIAN\'S NOTION OF CHRISTIANITY.\'WHAT happiness to Ione! what bliss to be ever by the side of Glaucus,to hear his voice!--And she too can see him!\'Such was the soliloquy of the blind girl, as she walked alone and attwilight to the house of her new mistress, whither Glaucus had alreadypreceded her.  Suddenly she was interrupted in her fond thoughts by afemale voice.\'Blind flower-girl, whither goest thou?  There is no pannier under thinearm; hast thou sold all thy flowers?\'The person thus accosting Nydia was a lady of a handsome but a bold andunmaidenly countenance: it was Julia, the daughter of Diomed. Her veilwas half raised as she spoke; she was accompanied by Diomed himself, andby a slave carrying a lantern before them--the merchant and his daughterwere returning home from a supper at one of their neighbors\'.\'Dost thou not remember my voice?\' continued Julia.  \'I am the daughterof Diomed the wealthy.\'\'Ah! forgive me; yes, I recall the tones of your voice.  No, nobleJulia, I have no flowers to sell.\'\'I heard that thou wert purchased by the beautiful Greek Glaucus; isthat true, pretty slave?\' asked Julia.\'I serve the Neapolitan, Ione,\' replied Nydia, evasively.\'Ah! and it is true, then...\'\'Come, come!\' interrupted Diomed, with his cloak up to his mouth, \'thenight grows cold; I cannot stay here while you prate to that blind girl:come, let her follow you home, if you wish to speak to her.\'\'Do, child,\' said Julia, with the air of one not accustomed to berefused; \'I have much to ask of thee: come.\'\'I cannot this night, it grows late,\' answered Nydia.  \'I must be athome; I am not free, noble Julia.\'\'What, the meek Ione will chide thee?--Ay, I doubt not she is a secondThalestris.  But come, then, to-morrow: do--remember I have been thyfriend of old.\'\'I will obey thy wishes,\' answered Nydia; and Diomed again impatientlysummoned his daughter: she was obliged to proceed, with the mainquestion she had desired to put to Nydia unasked.Meanwhile we return to Ione.  The interval of time that had elapsed thatday between the first and second visit of Glaucus had not been too gailyspent: she had received a visit from her brother.  Since the night hehad assisted in saving her from the Egyptian, she had not before seenhim.Occupied with his own thoughts--thoughts of so serious and intense anature--the young priest had thought little of his sister; in truth,men, perhaps of that fervent order of mind which is ever aspiring aboveearth, are but little prone to the earthlier affections; and it had beenlong since Apaecides had sought those soft and friendly interchanges ofthought, those sweet confidences, which in his earlier youth had boundhim to Ione, and which are so natural to that endearing connection whichexisted between them.Ione, however, had not ceased to regret his estrangement: she attributedit, at present, to the engrossing duties of his severe fraternity.  Andoften, amidst all her bright hopes, and her new attachment to herbetrothed--often, when she thought of her brother\'s brow prematurelyfurrowed, his unsmiling lip, and bended frame, she sighed to think thatthe service of the gods could throw so deep a shadow over that earthwhich the gods created.But this day when he visited her there was a strange calmness on hisfeatures, a more quiet and self-possessed expression in his sunken eyes,than she had marked for years.  This apparent improvement was butmomentary--it was a false calm, which the least breeze could ruffle.\'May the gods bless thee, my brother!\' said she, embracing him.\'The gods!  Speak not thus vaguely; perchance there is but one God!\'\'My brother!\'\'What if the sublime faith of the Nazarene be true?  What if God be amonarch--One--Invisible--Alone?  What if these numerous, countlessdeities, whose altars fill the earth, be but evil demons, seeking towean us from the true creed?  This may be the case, Ione!\'\'Alas! can we believe it? or if we believed, would it not be amelancholy faith,\' answered the Neapolitan.  \'What! all this beautifulworld made only human!--mountain disenchanted of its Oread--the watersof their Nymph--that beautiful prodigality of faith, which makeseverything divine, consecrating the meanest flowers, bearing celestialwhispers in the faintest breeze--wouldst thou deny this, and make theearth mere dust and clay?  No, Apaecides: all that is brightest in ourhearts is that very credulity which peoples the universe with gods.\'Ione answered as a believer in the poesy of the old mythology wouldanswer. We may judge by that reply how obstinate and hard the contestwhich Christianity had to endure among the heathens.  The GracefulSuperstition was never silent; every, the most household, action oftheir lives was entwined with it--it was a portion of life itself, asthe flowers are a part of the thyrsus.  At every incident they recurredto a god, every cup of wine was prefaced by a libation; the verygarlands on their thresholds were dedicated to some divinity; theirancestors themselves, made holy, presided as Lares over their hearth andhall.  So abundant was belief with them, that in their own climes, atthis hour, idolatry has never thoroughly been outrooted: it changes butits objects of worship; it appeals to innumerable saints where once itresorted to divinities; and it pours its crowds, in listening reverence,to oracles at the shrines of St. Januarius or St. Stephen, instead of tothose of Isis or Apollo.But these superstitions were not to the early Christians the object ofcontempt so much as of horror.  They did not believe, with the quietscepticism of the heathen philosopher, that the gods were inventions ofthe priests; nor even, with the vulgar, that, according to the dim lightof history, they had been mortals like themselves.  They imagined theheathen divinities to be evil spirits--they transplanted to Italy and toGreece the gloomy demons of India and the East; and in Jupiter or inMars they shuddered at the representative of Moloch or of Satan.Apaecides had not yet adopted formally the Christian faith, but he wasalready on the brink of it.  He already participated the doctrines ofOlinthus--he already imagined that the lively imaginations of theheathen were the suggestions of the arch-enemy of mankind.  The innocentand natural answer of Ione made him shudder.  He hastened to replyvehemently, and yet so confusedly, that Ione feared for his reason morethan she dreaded his violence.\'Ah, my brother!\' said she, \'these hard duties of thine have shatteredthy very sense.  Come to me, Apaecides, my brother, my own brother; giveme thy hand, let me wipe the dew from thy brow--chide me not now, Iunderstand thee not; think only that Ione could not offend thee!\'\'Ione,\' said Apaecides, drawing her towards him, and regarding hertenderly, \'can I think that this beautiful form, this kind heart, may bedestined to an eternity of torment?\'\'Dii meliora! the gods forbid!\' said Ione, in the customary form ofwords by which her contemporaries thought an omen might be averted.The words, and still more the superstition they implied, wounded the earof Apaecides.  He rose, muttering to himself, turned from the chamber,then, stopping, half way, gazed wistfully on Ione, and extended hisarms.Ione flew to them in joy; he kissed her earnestly, and then he said:\'Farewell, my sister! when we next meet, thou mayst be to me as nothing;take thou, then, this embrace--full yet of all the tender reminiscencesof childhood, when faith and hope, creeds, customs, interests, objects,were the same to us.  Now, the tie is to be broken!\'With these strange words he left the house.The great and severest trial of the primitive Christians was indeedthis; their conversion separated them from their dearest bonds. Theycould not associate with beings whose commonest actions, whose commonestforms of speech, were impregnated with idolatry.  They shuddered at theblessing of love, to their ears it was uttered in a demon\'s name.  This,their misfortune, was their strength; if it divided them from the restof the world, it was to unite them proportionally to each other.  Theywere men of iron who wrought forth the Word of God, and verily the bondsthat bound them were of iron also!Glaucus found Ione in tears; he had already assumed the sweet privilegeto console.  He drew from her a recital of her interview with herbrother; but in her confused account of language, itself so confused toone not prepared for it, he was equally at a loss with Ione to conceivethe intentions or the meaning of Apaecides.\'Hast thou ever heard much,\' asked she, \'of this new sect of theNazarenes, of which my brother spoke?\'\'I have often heard enough of the votaries,\' returned Glaucus, \'but oftheir exact tenets know I naught, save that in their doctrine thereseemeth something preternaturally chilling and morose.  They live apartfrom their kind; they affect to be shocked even at our simple uses ofgarlands; they have no sympathies with the cheerful amusements of life;they utter awful threats of the coming destruction of the world; theyappear, in one word, to have brought their unsmiling and gloomy creedout of the cave of Trophonius. Yet,\' continued Glaucus, after a slightpause, \'they have not wanted men of great power and genius, norconverts, even among the Areopagites of Athens. Well do I remember tohave heard my father speak of one strange guest at Athens, many yearsago; methinks his name was PAUL.  My father was amongst a mighty crowdthat gathered on one of our immemorial hills to hear this sage of theEast expound: through the wide throng there rang not a singlemurmur!--the jest and the roar, with which our native orators arereceived, were hushed for him--and when on the loftiest summit of thathill, raised above the breathless crowd below, stood this mysteriousvisitor, his mien and his countenance awed every heart, even before asound left his lips.  He was a man, I have heard my father say, of notall stature, but of noble and impressive mien; his robes were dark andample; the declining sun, for it was evening, shone aslant upon his formas it rose aloft, motionless, and commanding; his countenance was muchworn and marked, as of one who had braved alike misfortune and thesternest vicissitude of many climes; but his eyes were bright with analmost unearthly fire; and when he raised his arm to speak, it was withthe majesty of a man into whom the Spirit of a God hath rushed!\'""Men of Athens!"" he is reported to have said, ""I find amongst ye analtar with this inscription:              TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.  Ye worship in ignorance the same Deity I serve.    To you unknown till now, to you be it now revealed.""\'Then declared that solemn man how this great Maker of all things, whohad appointed unto man his several tribes and his various homes--theLord of earth and the universal heaven, dwelt not in temples made withhands; that His presence, His spirit, were in the air we breathed--ourlife and our being were with Him.  ""Think you,"" he cried, ""that theInvisible is like your statues of gold and marble?  Think you that Heneedeth sacrifice from you: He who made heaven and earth?"" Then spoke heof fearful and coming times, of the end of the world, of a second risingof the dead, whereof an assurance had been given to man in theresurrection of the mighty Being whose religion he came to preach.\'When he thus spoke, the long-pent murmur went forth, and thephilosophers that were mingled with the people, muttered their sagecontempt; there might you have seen the chilling frown of the Stoic, andthe Cynic\'s sneer; and the Epicurean, who believeth not even in our ownElysium, muttered a pleasant jest, and swept laughing through the crowd:but the deep heart of the people was touched and thrilled; and theytrembled, though they knew not why, for verily the stranger had thevoice and majesty of a man to whom ""The Unknown God"" had committed thepreaching of His faith.\'Ione listened with wrapt attention, and the serious and earnest mannerof the narrator betrayed the impression that he himself had receivedfrom one who had been amongst the audience that on the hill of theheathen Mars had heard the first tidings of the word of Christ!Chapter VITHE PORTER.  THE GIRL.  AND THE GLADIATOR.THE door of Diomed\'s house stood open, and Medon, the old slave, sat atthe bottom of the steps by which you ascended to the mansion. Thatluxurious mansion of the rich merchant of Pompeii is still to be seenjust without the gates of the city, at the commencement of the Street ofTombs; it was a gay neighborhood, despite the dead.  On the oppositeside, but at some yards nearer the gate, was a spacious hostelry, atwhich those brought by business or by pleasure to Pompeii often stoppedto refresh themselves.  In the space before the entrance of the inn nowstood wagons, and carts, and chariots, some just arrived, some justquitting, in all the bustle of an animated and popular resort of publicentertainment.  Before the door, some farmers, seated on a bench by asmall circular table, were talking over their morning cups, on theaffairs of their calling.  On the side of the door itself was paintedgaily and freshly the eternal sign of the chequers. By the roof of theinn stretched a terrace, on which some females, wives of the farmersabove mentioned, were, some seated, some leaning over the railing, andconversing with their friends below. In a deep recess, at a littledistance, was a covered seat, in which some two or three poorertravellers were resting themselves, and shaking the dust from theirgarments.  On the other side stretched a wide space, originally theburial-ground of a more ancient race than the present denizens ofPompeii, and now converted into the Ustrinum, or place for the burningof the dead.  Above this rose the terraces of a gay villa, half hid bytrees.  The tombs themselves, with their graceful and varied shapes, theflowers and the foliage that surrounded them, made no melancholy featurein the prospect.  Hard by the gate of the city, in a small niche, stoodthe still form of the well-disciplined Roman sentry, the sun shiningbrightly on his polished crest, and the lance on which he leaned.  Thegate itself was divided into three arches, the centre one for vehicles,the others for the foot-passengers; and on either side rose the massivewalls which girt the city, composed, patched, repaired at a thousanddifferent epochs, according as war, time, or the earthquake hadshattered that vain protection.  At frequent intervals rose squaretowers, whose summits broke in picturesque rudeness the regular line ofthe wall, and contrasted well with the modern buildings gleaming whitelyby.The curving road, which in that direction leads from Pompeii toHerculaneum, wound out of sight amidst hanging vines, above whichfrowned the sullen majesty of Vesuvius.\'Hast thou heard the news, old Medon?\' said a young woman, with apitcher in her hand, as she paused by Diomed\'s door to gossip a momentwith the slave, ere she repaired to the neighboring inn to fill thevessel, and coquet with the travellers.\'The news! what news?\' said the slave, raising his eyes moodily from theground.\'Why, there passed through the gate this morning, no doubt ere thou wertwell awake, such a visitor to Pompeii!\'\'Ay,\' said the slave, indifferently.\'Yes, a present from the noble Pomponianus.\'\'A present!  I thought thou saidst a visitor?\'\'It is both visitor and present.  Know, O dull and stupid! that it is amost beautiful young tiger, for our approaching games in theamphitheatre.  Hear you that, Medon?  Oh, what pleasure!  I declare Ishall not sleep a wink till I see it; they say it has such a roar!\'\'Poor fool!\' said Medon, sadly and cynically.\'Fool me no fool, old churl!  It is a pretty thing, a tiger, especiallyif we could but find somebody for him to eat.  We have now a lion and atiger; only consider that, Medon! and for want of two good criminalsperhaps we shall be forced to see them eat each other.  By-the-by, yourson is a gladiator, a handsome man and a strong, can you not persuadehim to fight the tiger?  Do now, you would oblige me mightily; nay, youwould be a benefactor to the whole town.\'\'Vah! vah!\' said the slave, with great asperity; \'think of thine owndanger ere thou thus pratest of my poor boy\'s death.\'\'My own danger!\' said the girl, frightened and looking hastilyaround--\'Avert the omen! let thy words fall on thine own head!\' And thegirl, as she spoke, touched a talisman suspended round her neck. \'""Thineown danger!"" what danger threatens me?\'\'Had the earthquake but a few nights since no warning?\' said Medon.\'Has it not a voice?  Did it not say to us all, ""Prepare for death; theend of all things is at hand?""\'\'Bah, stuff!\' said the young woman, settling the folds of her tunic.\'Now thou talkest as they say the Nazarenes talked--methinks thou artone of them.  Well, I can prate with thee, grey croaker, no more: thougrowest worse and worse--Vale! O Hercules, send us a man for thelion--and another for the tiger!\'            Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show,            With a forest of faces in every row!            Lo, the swordsmen, bold as the son of Alcmena,            Sweep, side by side, o\'er the hushed arena;            Talk while you may--you will hold your breath            When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death.            Tramp, tramp, how gaily they go!            Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show!Chanting in a silver and clear voice this feminine ditty, and holding upher tunic from the dusty road, the young woman stepped lightly across tothe crowded hostelry.\'My poor son!\' said the slave, half aloud, \'is it for things like thisthou art to be butchered?  Oh! faith of Christ, I could worship thee inall sincerity, were it but for the horror which thou inspirest for thesebloody lists.\'The old man\'s head sank dejectedly on his breast.  He remained silentand absorbed, but every now and then with the corner of his sleeve hewiped his eyes.  His heart was with his son; he did not see the figurethat now approached from the gate with a quick step, and a somewhatfierce and reckless gait and carriage.  He did not lift his eyes tillthe figure paused opposite the place where he sat, and with a soft voiceaddressed him by the name of:\'Father!\'\'My boy! my Lydon! is it indeed thou?\' said the old man, joyfully. \'Ah,thou wert present to my thoughts.\'\'I am glad to hear it, my father,\' said the gladiator, respectfullytouching the knees and beard of the slave; \'and soon may I be alwayspresent with thee, not in thought only.\'\'Yes, my son--but not in this world,\' replied the slave, mournfully.\'Talk not thus, O my sire! look cheerfully, for I feel so--I am surethat I shall win the day; and then, the gold I gain buys thy freedom.Oh! my father, it was but a few days since that I was taunted, by one,too, whom I would gladly have undeceived, for he is more generous thanthe rest of his equals.  He is not Roman--he is of Athens--by him I wastaunted with the lust of gain--when I demanded what sum was the prize ofvictory.  Alas! he little knew the soul of Lydon!\'\'My boy! my boy!\' said the old slave, as, slowly ascending the steps, heconducted his son to his own little chamber, communicating with theentrance hall (which in this villa was the peristyle, not theatrium)--you may see it now; it is the third door to the right onentering.  (The first door conducts to the staircase; the second is buta false recess, in which there stood a statue of bronze.) \'Generous,affectionate, pious as are thy motives,\' said Medon, when they were thussecured from observation, \'thy deed itself is guilt: thou art to riskthy blood for thy father\'s freedom--that might be forgiven; but theprize of victory is the blood of another.  Oh, that is a deadly sin; noobject can purify it.  Forbear! forbear! rather would I be a slave forever than purchase liberty on such terms!\'\'Hush, my father!\' replied Lydon, somewhat impatiently; \'thou hastpicked up in this new creed of thine, of which I pray thee not to speakto me, for the gods that gave me strength denied me wisdom, and Iunderstand not one word of what thou often preachest to me--thou hastpicked up, I say, in this new creed, some singular fantasies of rightand wrong.  Pardon me if I offend thee: but reflect!  Against whom shallI contend?  Oh! couldst thou know those wretches with whom, for thysake, I assort, thou wouldst think I purified earth by removing one ofthem.  Beasts, whose very lips drop blood; things, all savage,unprincipled in their very courage: ferocious, heartless, senseless; notie of life can bind them: they know not fear, it is true--but neitherknow they gratitude, nor charity, nor love; they are made but for theirown career, to slaughter without pity, to die without dread!  Can thygods, whosoever they be, look with wrath on a conflict with such asthese, and in such a cause?  Oh, My father, wherever the powers abovegaze down on earth, they behold no duty so sacred, so sanctifying, asthe sacrifice offered to an aged parent by the piety of a grateful son!\'The poor old slave, himself deprived of the lights of knowledge, andonly late a convert to the Christian faith, knew not with what argumentsto enlighten an ignorance at once so dark, and yet so beautiful in itserror. His first impulse was to throw himself on his son\'s breast--hisnext to start away to wring his hands; and in the attempt to reprove,his broken voice lost itself in weeping.\'And if,\' resumed Lydon--\'if thy Deity (methinks thou wilt own but one?)be indeed that benevolent and pitying Power which thou assertest Him tobe, He will know also that thy very faith in Him first confirmed me inthat determination thou blamest.\'\'How! what mean you?\' said the slave.\'Why, thou knowest that I, sold in my childhood as a slave, was set freeat Rome by the will of my master, whom I had been fortunate enough toplease. I hastened to Pompeii to see thee--I found thee already aged andinfirm, under the yoke of a capricious and pampered lord--thou hadstlately adopted this new faith, and its adoption made thy slavery doublypainful to thee; it took away all the softening charm of custom, whichreconciles us so often to the worst.  Didst thou not complain to me thatthou wert compelled to offices that were not odious to thee as a slave,but guilty as a Nazarene? Didst thou not tell me that thy soul shookwith remorse when thou wert compelled to place even a crumb of cakebefore the Lares that watch over yon impluvium? that thy soul was tornby a perpetual struggle?  Didst thou not tell me that even by pouringwine before the threshold, and calling on the name of some Greciandeity, thou didst fear thou wert incurring penalties worse than those ofTantalus, an eternity of tortures more terrible than those of theTartarian fields?  Didst thou not tell me this?  I wondered, I could notcomprehend; nor, by Hercules! can I now: but I was thy son, and my soletask was to compassionate and relieve.  Could I hear thy groans, could Iwitness thy mysterious horrors, thy constant anguish, and remaininactive? No! by the immortal gods! the thought struck me like lightfrom Olympus!  I had no money, but I had strength and youth--these werethy gifts--I could sell these in my turn for thee!  I learned the amountof thy ransom--I learned that the usual prize of a victorious gladiatorwould doubly pay it. I became a gladiator--I linked myself with thoseaccursed men, scorning, loathing, while I joined--I acquired theirskill--blessed be the lesson!--it shall teach me to free my father!\'\'Oh, that thou couldst hear Olinthus!\' sighed the old man, more and moreaffected by the virtue of his son, but not less strongly convinced ofthe criminality of his purpose.\'I will hear the whole world talk if thou wilt,\' answered the gladiator,gaily; \'but not till thou art a slave no more.  Beneath thy own roof, myfather, thou shalt puzzle this dull brain all day long, ay, and allnight too, if it give thee pleasure.  Oh, such a spot as I have chalkedout for thee!--it is one of the nine hundred and ninety-nine shops ofold Julia Felix, in the sunny part of the city, where thou mayst baskbefore the door in the day--and I will sell the oil and the wine forthee, my father--and then, please Venus (or if it does not please her,since thou lovest not her name, it is all one to Lydon)--then, I say,perhaps thou mayst have a daughter, too, to tend thy grey hairs, andhear shrill voices at thy knee, that shall call thee ""Lydon\'s father!""Ah! we shall be so happy--the prize can purchase all.  Cheer thee! cheerup, my sire!--And now I must away--day wears--the lanista waits me.Come! thy blessing!\'As Lydon thus spoke, he had already quitted the dark chamber of hisfather; and speaking eagerly, though in a whispered tone, they now stoodat the same place in which we introduced the porter at his post.\'O bless thee! bless thee, my brave boy!\' said Medon, fervently; \'andmay the great Power that reads all hearts see the nobleness of thine,and forgive its error!\'The tall shape of the gladiator passed swiftly down the path; the eyesof the slave followed its light but stately steps, till the last glimpsewas gone; and then, sinking once more on his seat, his eyes againfastened themselves on the ground.  His form, mute and unmoving, as athing of stone. His heart!--who, in our happier age, can even imagineits struggles--its commotion?\'May I enter?\' said a sweet voice.  \'Is thy mistress Julia within?\'The slave mechanically motioned to the visitor to enter, but she whoaddressed him could not see the gesture--she repeated her questiontimidly, but in a louder voice.\'Have I not told thee!\' said the slave, peevishly: \'enter.\'\'Thanks,\' said the speaker, plaintively; and the slave, roused by thetone, looked up, and recognized the blind flower-girl.  Sorrow cansympathize with affliction--he raised himself, and guided her steps tothe head of the adjacent staircase (by which you descended to Julia\'sapartment), where, summoning a female slave, he consigned to her thecharge of the blind girl.Chapter VIITHE DRESSING-ROOM OF A POMPEIAN BEAUTY. IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BETWEENJULIA AND NYDIA.THE elegant Julia sat in her chamber, with her slaves around her--likethe cubiculum which adjoined it, the room was small, but much largerthan the usual apartments appropriated to sleep, which were sodiminutive, that few who have not seen the bed-chambers, even in thegayest mansions, can form any notion of the petty pigeon-holes in whichthe citizens of Pompeii evidently thought it desirable to pass thenight.  But, in fact, \'bed\' with the ancients was not that grave,serious, and important part of domestic mysteries which it is with us.The couch itself was more like a very narrow and small sofa, lightenough to be transported easily, and by the occupant himself, from placeto place; and it was, no doubt, constantly shifted from chamber tochamber, according to the caprice of the inmate, or the changes of theseason; for that side of the house which was crowded in one month,might, perhaps, be carefully avoided in the next.  There was also amongthe Italians of that period a singular and fastidious apprehension oftoo much daylight; their darkened chambers, which first appear to us theresult of a negligent architecture, were the effect of the mostelaborate study. In their porticoes and gardens they courted the sunwhenever it so pleased their luxurious tastes.  In the interior of theirhouses they sought rather the coolness and the shade.Julia\'s apartment at that season was in the lower part of the house,immediately beneath the state rooms above, and looking upon the garden,with which it was on a level.  The wide door, which was glazed, aloneadmitted the morning rays: yet her eye, accustomed to a certaindarkness, was sufficiently acute to perceive exactly what colors werethe most becoming--what shade of the delicate rouge gave the brightestbeam to her dark glance, and the most youthful freshness to her cheek.On the table, before which she sat, was a small and circular mirror ofthe most polished steel: round which, in precise order, were ranged thecosmetics and the unguents--the perfumes and the paints--the jewels andcombs--the ribands and the gold pins, which were destined to add to thenatural attractions of beauty the assistance of art and the capriciousallurements of fashion.  Through the dimness of the room glowed brightlythe vivid and various colourings of the wall, in all the dazzlingfrescoes of Pompeian taste.  Before the dressing-table, and under thefeet of Julia, was spread a carpet, woven from the looms of the East.Near at hand, on another table, was a silver basin and ewer; anextinguished lamp, of most exquisite workmanship, in which the artisthad represented a Cupid reposing under the spreading branches of amyrtle-tree; and a small roll of papyrus, containing the softest elegiesof Tibullus.  Before the door, which communicated with the cubiculum,hung a curtain richly broidered with gold flowers.  Such was thedressing-room of a beauty eighteen centuries ago.The fair Julia leaned indolently back on her seat, while the ornatrix(i.e. hairdresser) slowly piled, one above the other, a mass of smallcurls, dexterously weaving the false with the true, and carrying thewhole fabric to a height that seemed to place the head rather at thecentre than the summit of the human form.Her tunic, of a deep amber, which well set off her dark hair andsomewhat embrowned complexion, swept in ample folds to her feet, whichwere cased in slippers, fastened round the slender ankle by whitethongs; while a profusion of pearls were embroidered in the slipperitself, which was of purple, and turned slightly upward, as do theTurkish slippers at this day. An old slave, skilled by long experiencein all the arcana of the toilet, stood beside the hairdresser, with thebroad and studded girdle of her mistress over her arm, and giving, fromtime to time (mingled with judicious flattery to the lady herself),instructions to the mason of the ascending pile.\'Put that pin rather more to the right--lower--stupid one!  Do you notobserve how even those beautiful eyebrows are?--One would think you weredressing Corinna, whose face is all of one side.  Now put in theflowers--what, fool!--not that dull pink--you are not suiting colors tothe dim cheek of Chloris: it must be the brightest flowers that canalone suit the cheek of the young Julia.\'\'Gently!\' said the lady, stamping her small foot violently: \'you pull myhair as if you were plucking up a weed!\'\'Dull thing!\' continued the directress of the ceremony.  \'Do you notknow how delicate is your mistress?--you are not dressing the coarsehorsehair of the widow Fulvia.  Now, then, the riband--that\'s right.Fair Julia, look in the mirror; saw you ever anything so lovely asyourself?\'When, after innumerable comments, difficulties, and delays, theintricate tower was at length completed, the next preparation was thatof giving to the eyes the soft languish, produced by a dark powderapplied to the lids and brows; a small patch cut in the form of acrescent, skillfully placed by the rosy lips, attracted attention totheir dimples, and to the teeth, to which already every art had beenapplied in order to heighten the dazzle of their natural whiteness.To another slave, hitherto idle, was now consigned the charge ofarranging the jewels--the ear-rings of pearl (two to each ear)--themassive bracelets of gold--the chain formed of rings of the same metal,to which a talisman cut in crystals was attached--the graceful buckle onthe left shoulder, in which was set an exquisite cameo of Psyche--thegirdle of purple riband, richly wrought with threads of gold, andclasped by interlacing serpents--and lastly, the various rings, fittedto every joint of the white and slender fingers.  The toilet was nowarranged according to the last mode of Rome.  The fair Julia regardedherself with a last gaze of complacent vanity, and reclining again uponher seat, she bade the youngest of her slaves, in a listless tone, readto her the enamoured couplets of Tibullus. This lecture was stillproceeding, when a female slave admitted Nydia into the presence of thelady of the place.\'Salve, Julia!\' said the flower-girl, arresting her steps within a fewpaces from the spot where Julia sat, and crossing her arms upon herbreast.  \'I have obeyed your commands.\'\'You have done well, flower-girl,\' answered the lady.  \'Approach--youmay take a seat.\'One of the slaves placed a stool by Julia, and Nydia seated herself.Julia looked hard at the Thessalian for some moments in rather anembarrassed silence.  She then motioned her attendants to withdraw, andto close the door.  When they were alone, she said, looking mechanicallyfrom Nydia, and forgetful that she was with one who could not observeher countenance:\'You serve the Neapolitan, Ione?\'\'I am with her at present,\' answered Nydia.\'Is she as handsome as they say?\'\'I know not,\' replied Nydia.  \'How can I judge?\'\'Ah! I should have remembered.  But thou hast ears, if not eyes.  Do thyfellow-slaves tell thee she is handsome?  Slaves talking with oneanother forget to flatter even their mistress.\'\'They tell me that she is beautiful.\'\'Hem!--say they that she is tall?\'\'Yes.\'\'Why, so am I.  Dark haired?\'\'I have heard so.\'\'So am I.  And doth Glaucus visit her much?\'\'Daily\' returned Nydia, with a half-suppressed sigh.\'Daily, indeed!  Does he find her handsome?\'\'I should think so, since they are so soon to be wedded.\'\'Wedded!\' cried Julia, turning pale even through the false roses on hercheek, and starting from her couch.  Nydia did not, of course, perceivethe emotion she had caused.  Julia remained a long time silent; but herheaving breast and flashing eyes would have betrayed, to one who couldhave seen, the wound her vanity had sustained.\'They tell me thou art a Thessalian,\' said she, at last breakingsilence.\'And truly!\'\'Thessaly is the land of magic and of witches, of talismans and oflove-philtres,\' said Julia.\'It has ever been celebrated for its sorcerers,\' returned Nydia,timidly.\'Knowest thou, then, blind Thessalian, of any love-charms?\'\'I!\' said the flower-girl, coloring; \'I! how should I?  No, assuredlynot!\'\'The worse for thee; I could have given thee gold enough to havepurchased thy freedom hadst thou been more wise.\'\'But what,\' asked Nydia, \'can induce the beautiful and wealthy Julia toask that question of her servant?  Has she not money, and youth, andloveliness? Are they not love-charms enough to dispense with magic?\'\'To all but one person in the world,\' answered Julia, haughtily: \'butmethinks thy blindness is infectious; and...  But no matter.\'\'And that one person?\' said Nydia, eagerly.\'Is not Glaucus,\' replied Julia, with the customary deceit of her sex.\'Glaucus--no!\'Nydia drew her breath more freely, and after a short pause Juliarecommenced.\'But talking of Glaucus, and his attachment to this Neapolitan, remindedme of the influence of love-spells, which, for ought I know or care, shemay have exercised upon him.  Blind girl, I love, and--shall Julia liveto say it?--am loved not in return!  This humbles--nay, not humbles--butit stings my pride.  I would see this ingrate at my feet--not in orderthat I might raise, but that I might spurn him.  When they told me thouwert Thessalian, I imagined thy young mind might have learned the darksecrets of thy clime.\'\'Alas! no,\' murmured Nydia: \'would it had!\'\'Thanks, at least, for that kindly wish,\' said Julia, unconscious ofwhat was passing in the breast of the flower-girl.\'But tell me--thou hearest the gossip of slaves, always prone to thesedim beliefs; always ready to apply to sorcery for their own lowloves--hast thou ever heard of any Eastern magician in this city, whopossesses the art of which thou art ignorant?  No vain chiromancer, nojuggler of the market-place, but some more potent and mighty magician ofIndia or of Egypt?\'\'Of Egypt?--yes!\' said Nydia, shuddering.  \'What Pompeian has not heardof Arbaces?\'\'Arbaces! true,\' replied Julia, grasping at the recollection. \'Theysay he is a man above all the petty and false impostures of dullpretenders--that he is versed in the learning of the stars, and thesecrets of the ancient Nox; why not in the mysteries of love?\'\'If there be one magician living whose art is above that of others, itis that dread man,\' answered Nydia; and she felt her talisman while shespoke.\'He is too wealthy to divine for money?\' continued Julia, sneeringly.\'Can I not visit him?\'\'It is an evil mansion for the young and the beautiful,\' replied Nydia.\'I have heard, too, that he languishes in...\'\'An evil mansion!\' said Julia, catching only the first sentence. \'Whyso?\'\'The orgies of his midnight leisure are impure and polluted--at least,so says rumor.\'\'By Ceres, by Pan, and by Cybele! thou dost but provoke my curiosity,instead of exciting my fears,\' returned the wayward and pamperedPompeian. \'I will seek and question him of his lore.  If to these orgieslove be admitted--why the more likely that he knows its secrets!\'Nydia did not answer.\'I will seek him this very day,\' resumed Julia; \'nay, why not this veryhour?\'\'At daylight, and in his present state, thou hast assuredly the less tofear,\' answered Nydia, yielding to her own sudden and secret wish tolearn if the dark Egyptian were indeed possessed of those spells torivet and attract love, of which the Thessalian had so often heard.\'And who dare insult the rich daughter of Diomed?\' said Julia,haughtily. \'I will go.\'\'May I visit thee afterwards to learn the result?\' asked Nydia,anxiously.\'Kiss me for thy interest in Julia\'s honour,\' answered the lady. \'Yes,assuredly.  This eve we sup abroad--come hither at the same hourto-morrow, and thou shalt know all: I may have to employ thee too; butenough for the present.  Stay, take this bracelet for the new thoughtthou hast inspired me with; remember, if thou servest Julia, she isgrateful and she is generous.\'\'I cannot take thy present,\' said Nydia, putting aside the bracelet;\'but young as I am, I can sympathize unbought with those who love--andlove in vain.\'\'Sayest thou so!\' returned Julia.  \'Thou speakest like a free woman--andthou shalt yet be free--farewell!\'Chapter VIIIJULIA SEEKS ARBACES.  THE RESULT OF THAT INTERVIEW.ARBACES was seated in a chamber which opened on a kind of balcony orportico that fronted his garden.  His cheek was pale and worn with thesufferings he had endured, but his iron frame had already recovered fromthe severest effects of that accident which had frustrated his felldesigns in the moment of victory.  The air that came fragrantly to hisbrow revived his languid senses, and the blood circulated more freelythan it had done for days through his shrunken veins.\'So, then,\' thought he, \'the storm of fate has broken and blownover--the evil which my lore predicted, threatening life itself, haschanced--and yet I live!  It came as the stars foretold; and now thelong, bright, and prosperous career which was to succeed that evil, if Isurvived it, smiles beyond: I have passed--I have subdued the latestdanger of my destiny.  Now I have but to lay out the gardens of myfuture fate--unterrified and secure. First, then, of all my pleasures,even before that of love, shall come revenge!  This boy Greek--who hascrossed my passion--thwarted my designs--baffled me even when the bladewas about to drink his accursed blood--shall not a second time escapeme!  But for the method of my vengeance?  Of that let me ponder well!Oh! Ate, if thou art indeed a goddess, fill me with thy direstInspiration!\' The Egyptian sank into an intent reverie, which did notseem to present to him any clear or satisfactory suggestions.  Hechanged his position restlessly, as he revolved scheme after scheme,which no sooner occurred than it was dismissed: several times he struckhis breast and groaned aloud, with the desire of vengeance, and a senseof his impotence to accomplish it. While thus absorbed, a boy slavetimidly entered the chamber.A female, evidently of rank from her dress, and that of the single slavewho attended her, waited below and sought an audience with Arbaces.\'A female!\' his heart beat quick.  \'Is she young?\'\'Her face is concealed by her veil; but her form is slight, yet round,as that of youth.\'\'Admit her,\' said the Egyptian: for a moment his vain heart dreamed thestranger might be Ione.The first glance of the visitor now entering the apartment sufficed toundeceive so erring a fancy.  True, she was about the same height asIone, and perhaps the same age--true, she was finely and richlyformed--but where was that undulating and ineffable grace whichaccompanied every motion of the peerless Neapolitan--the chaste anddecorous garb, so simple even in the care of its arrangement--thedignified yet bashful step--the majesty of womanhood and its modesty?\'Pardon me that I rise with pain,\' said Arbaces, gazing on the stranger:\'I am still suffering from recent illness.\'\'Do not disturb thyself, O great Egyptian!\' returned Julia, seeking todisguise the fear she already experienced beneath the ready resort offlattery; \'and forgive an unfortunate female, who seeks consolation fromthy wisdom.\'\'Draw near, fair stranger,\' said Arbaces; \'and speak withoutapprehension or reserve.\'Julia placed herself on a seat beside the Egyptian, and wonderinglygazed around an apartment whose elaborate and costly luxuries shamedeven the ornate enrichment of her father\'s mansion; fearfully, too, sheregarded the hieroglyphical inscriptions on the walls--the faces of themysterious images, which at every corner gazed upon her--the tripod at alittle distance--and, above all, the grave and remarkable countenance ofArbaces himself: a long white robe like a veil half covered his ravenlocks, and flowed to his feet: his face was made even more impressive byits present paleness; and his dark and penetrating eyes seemed to piercethe shelter of her veil, and explore the secrets of her vain andunfeminine soul.\'And what,\' said his low, deep voice, \'brings thee, O maiden! to thehouse of the Eastern stranger?\'\'His fame,\' replied Julia.\'In what?\' said he, with a strange and slight smile.\'Canst thou ask, O wise Arbaces?  Is not thy knowledge the very gossiptheme of Pompeii?\'\'Some little lore have I indeed, treasured up,\' replied Arbaces: \'but inwhat can such serious and sterile secrets benefit the ear of beauty?\'\'Alas!\' said Julia, a little cheered by the accustomed accents ofadulation; \'does not sorrow fly to wisdom for relief, and they who loveunrequitedly, are not they the chosen victims of grief?\'\'Ha!\' said Arbaces, \'can unrequited love be the lot of so fair a form,whose modelled proportions are visible even beneath the folds of thygraceful robe?  Deign, O maiden! to lift thy veil, that I may see atleast if the face correspond in loveliness with the form.\'Not unwilling, perhaps, to exhibit her charms, and thinking they werelikely to interest the magician in her fate, Julia, after some slighthesitation, raised her veil, and revealed a beauty which, but for art,had been indeed attractive to the fixed gaze of the Egyptian.\'Thou comest to me for advice in unhappy love,\' said he; \'well, turnthat face on the ungrateful one: what other love-charm can I give thee?\'\'Oh, cease these courtesies!\' said Julia; \'it is a love-charm, indeed,that I would ask from thy skill!\'\'Fair stranger!\' replied Arbaces, somewhat scornfully, \'love-spells arenot among the secrets I have wasted the midnight oil to attain.\'\'Is it indeed so?  Then pardon me, great Arbaces, and farewell!\'\'Stay,\' said Arbaces, who, despite his passion for Ione, was not unmovedby the beauty of his visitor; and had he been in the flush of a moreassured health, might have attempted to console the fair Julia by othermeans than those of supernatural wisdom.\'Stay; although I confess that I have left the witchery of philtres andpotions to those whose trade is in such knowledge, yet am I myself notso dull to beauty but that in earlier youth I may have employed them inmy own behalf.  I may give thee advice, at least, if thou wilt be candidwith me. Tell me then, first, art thou unmarried, as thy dressbetokens?\'\'Yes,\' said Julia.\'And, being unblest with fortune, wouldst thou allure some wealthysuitor?\'\'I am richer than he who disdains me.\'\'Strange and more strange!  And thou lovest him who loves not thee?\'\'I know not if I love him,\' answered Julia, haughtily; \'but I know thatI would see myself triumph over a rival--I would see him who rejected memy suitor--I would see her whom he has preferred in her turn despised.\'\'A natural ambition and a womanly,\' said the Egyptian, in a tone toograve for irony.  \'Yet more, fair maiden; wilt thou confide to me thename of thy lover?  Can he be Pompeian, and despise wealth, even ifblind to beauty?\'\'He is of Athens,\' answered Julia, looking down.\'Ha!\' cried the Egyptian, impetuously, as the blood rushed to his cheek;\'there is but one Athenian, young and noble, in Pompeii. Can it beGlaucus of whom thou speakest!\'\'Ah! betray me not--so indeed they call him.\'The Egyptian sank back, gazing vacantly on the averted face of themerchant\'s daughter, and muttering inly to himself: this conference,with which he had hitherto only trifled, amusing himself with thecredulity and vanity of his visitor--might it not minister to hisrevenge?\'\'I see thou canst assist me not,\' said Julia, offended by his continuedsilence; \'guard at least my secret.  Once more, farewell!\'\'Maiden,\' said the Egyptian, in an earnest and serious tone, \'thy suithath touched me--I will minister to thy will.  Listen to me; I have notmyself dabbled in these lesser mysteries, but I know one who hath.  Atthe base of Vesuvius, less than a league from the city, there dwells apowerful witch; beneath the rank dews of the new moon, she has gatheredthe herbs which possess the virtue to chain Love in eternal fetters.Her art can bring thy lover to thy feet.  Seek her, and mention to herthe name of Arbaces: she fears that name, and will give thee her mostpotent philtres.\'\'Alas!\' answered Julia, I know not the road to the home of her whom thouspeakest of: the way, short though it be, is long to traverse for a girlwho leaves, unknown, the house of her father. The country is entangledwith wild vines, and dangerous with precipitous caverns.  I dare nottrust to mere strangers to guide me; the reputation of women of my rankis easily tarnished--and though I care not who knows that I loveGlaucus, I would not have it imagined that I obtained his love by aspell.\'\'Were I but three days advanced in health,\' said the Egyptian, risingand walking (as if to try his strength) across the chamber, but withirregular and feeble steps, \'I myself would accompany thee.  Well, thoumust wait.\'\'But Glaucus is soon to wed that hated Neapolitan.\'\'Wed!\'\'Yes; in the early part of next month.\'\'So soon!  Art thou well advised of this?\'\'From the lips of her own slave.\'\'It shall not be!\' said the Egyptian, impetuously.  \'Fear nothing,Glaucus shall be thine.  Yet how, when thou obtainest it, canst thouadminister to him this potion?\'\'My father has invited him, and, I believe, the Neapolitan also, to abanquet, on the day following to-morrow: I shall then have theopportunity to administer it.\'\'So be it!\' said the Egyptian, with eyes flashing such fierce joy, thatJulia\'s gaze sank trembling beneath them.  \'To-morrow eve, then, orderthy litter--thou hast one at thy command?\'\'Surely--yes,\' returned the purse-proud Julia.\'Order thy litter--at two miles\' distance from the city is a house ofentertainment, frequented by the wealthier Pompeians, from theexcellence of its baths, and the beauty of its gardens.  There canstthou pretend only to shape thy course--there, ill or dying, I will meetthee by the statue of Silenus, in the copse that skirts the garden; andI myself will guide thee to the witch.  Let us wait till, with theevening star, the goats of the herdsmen are gone to rest; when the darktwilight conceals us, and none shall cross our steps.  Go home and fearnot.  By Hades, swears Arbaces, the sorcerer of Egypt, that Ione shallnever wed with Glaucus.\'\'And that Glaucus shall be mine,\' added Julia, filling up theincompleted sentence.\'Thou hast said it!\' replied Arbaces; and Julia, half frightened at thisunhallowed appointment, but urged on by jealousy and the pique ofrivalship, even more than love, resolved to fulfill it.Left alone, Arbaces burst forth:\'Bright stars that never lie, ye already begin the execution of yourpromises--success in love, and victory over foes, for the rest of mysmooth existence.  In the very hour when my mind could devise no clue tothe goal of vengeance, have ye sent this fair fool for my guide?\' Hepaused in deep thought.  \'Yes,\' said he again, but in a calmer voice; \'Icould not myself have given to her the poison, that shall be indeed aphiltre!--his death might be thus tracked to my door.  But thewitch--ay, there is the fit, the natural agent of my designs!\'He summoned one of his slaves, bade him hasten to track the steps ofJulia, and acquaint himself with her name and condition.  This done, hestepped forth into the portico.  The skies were serene and clear; buthe, deeply read in the signs of their various change, beheld in one massof cloud, far on the horizon, which the wind began slowly to agitate,that a storm was brooding above.\'It is like my vengeance,\' said he, as he gazed; \'the sky is clear, butthe cloud moves on.\'Chapter IXSTORM IN THE SOUTH.  THE WITCH\'S CAVERN.IT was when the heats of noon died gradually away from the earth, thatGlaucus and Ione went forth to enjoy the cooled and grateful air.  Atthat time, various carriages were in use among the Romans; the one mostused by the richer citizens, when they required no companion in theirexcursion, was the biga, already described in the early portion of thiswork; that appropriated to the matrons, was termed carpentum, which hadcommonly two wheels; the ancients used also a sort of litter, a vastsedan-chair, more commodiously arranged than the modern, inasmuch as theoccupant thereof could lie down at ease, instead of beingperpendicularly and stiffly jostled up and down.  There was anothercarriage, used both for travelling and for excursions in the country; itwas commodious, containing three or four persons with ease, having acovering which could be raised at pleasure; and, in short, answeringvery much the purpose of (though very different in shape from) themodern britska.  It was a vehicle of this description that the lovers,accompanied by one female slave of Ione, now used in their excursion.About ten miles from the city, there was at that day an old ruin, theremains of a temple, evidently Grecian; and as for Glaucus and Ioneeverything Grecian possessed an interest, they had agreed to visit theseruins: it was thither they were now bound.Their road lay among vines and olive-groves; till, winding more and moretowards the higher ground of Vesuvius, the path grew rugged; the mulesmoved slowly, and with labor; and at every opening in the wood theybeheld those grey and horrent caverns indenting the parched rock, whichStrabo has described; but which the various revolutions of time and thevolcano have removed from the present aspect of the mountain.  The sun,sloping towards his descent, cast long and deep shadows over themountain; here and there they still heard the rustic reed of theshepherd amongst copses of the beechwood and wild oak.  Sometimes theymarked the form of the silk-haired and graceful capella, with itswreathing horn and bright grey eye--which, still beneath Ausonian skies,recalls the eclogues of Maro, browsing half-way up the hills; and thegrapes, already purple with the smiles of the deepening summer, glowedout from the arched festoons, which hung pendent from tree to tree.Above them, light clouds floated in the serene heavens, sweeping soslowly athwart the firmament that they scarcely seemed to stir; while,on their right, they caught, ever and anon, glimpses of the wavelesssea, with some light bark skimming its surface; and the sunlightbreaking over the deep in those countless and softest hues so peculiarto that delicious sea.\'How beautiful!\' said Glaucus, in a half-whispered tone, \'is thatexpression by which we call Earth our Mother!  With what a kindly equallove she pours her blessings upon her children! and even to thosesterile spots to which Nature has denied beauty, she yet contrives todispense her smiles: witness the arbutus and the vine, which shewreathes over the arid and burning soil of yon extinct volcano.  Ah! insuch an hour and scene as this, well might we imagine that the Faunshould peep forth from those green festoons; or, that we might trace thesteps of the Mountain Nymph through the thickest mazes of the glade.But the Nymphs ceased, beautiful Ione, when thou wert created!\'There is no tongue that flatters like a lover\'s; and yet, in theexaggeration of his feelings, flattery seems to him commonplace. Strangeand prodigal exuberance, which soon exhausts itself by overflowing!They arrived at the ruins; they examined them with that fondness withwhich we trace the hallowed and household vestiges of our ownancestry--they lingered there till Hesperus appeared in the rosyheavens; and then returning homeward in the twilight, they were moresilent than they had been; for in the shadow and beneath the stars theyfelt more oppressively their mutual love.It was at this time that the storm which the Egyptian had predictedbegan to creep visibly over them.  At first, a low and distant thundergave warning of the approaching conflict of the elements; and thenrapidly rushed above the dark ranks of the serried clouds.  Thesuddenness of storms in that climate is something almost preternatural,and might well suggest to early superstition the notion of a divineagency--a few large drops broke heavily among the boughs that halfoverhung their path, and then, swift and intolerably bright, the forkedlightning darted across their very eyes, and was swallowed up by theincreasing darkness.\'Swifter, good Carrucarius!\' cried Glaucus to the driver; \'the tempestcomes on apace.\'The slave urged on the mules--they went swift over the uneven and stonyroad--the clouds thickened, near and more near broke the thunder, andfast rushed the dashing rain.\'Dost thou fear?\' whispered Glaucus, as he sought excuse in the storm tocome nearer to Ione.\'Not with thee,\' said she, softly.At that instant, the carriage, fragile and ill-contrived (as, despitetheir graceful shapes, were, for practical uses, most of such inventionsat that time), struck violently into a deep rut, over which lay a log offallen wood; the driver, with a curse, stimulated his mules yet fasterfor the obstacle, the wheel was torn from the socket, and the carriagesuddenly overset.Glaucus, quickly extricating himself from the vehicle, hastened toassist Ione, who was fortunately unhurt; with some difficulty theyraised the carruca (or carriage), and found that it ceased any longereven to afford them shelter; the springs that fastened the covering weresnapped asunder, and the rain poured fast and fiercely into theinterior.In this dilemma, what was to be done?  They were yet some distance fromthe city--no house, no aid, seemed near.\'There is,\' said the slave, \'a smith about a mile off; I could seek him,and he might fasten at least the wheel to the carruca--but, Jupiter! howthe rain beats; my mistress will be wet before I come back.\'\'Run thither at least,\' said Glaucus; \'we must find the best shelter wecan till you return.\'The lane was overshadowed with trees, beneath the amplest of whichGlaucus drew Ione.  He endeavored, by stripping his own cloak, to shieldher yet more from the rapid rain; but it descended with a fury thatbroke through all puny obstacles: and suddenly, while Glaucus was yetwhispering courage to his beautiful charge, the lightning struck one ofthe trees immediately before them, and split with a mighty crash itshuge trunk in twain.  This awful incident apprised them of the dangerthey braved in their present shelter, and Glaucus looked anxiously roundfor some less perilous place of refuge.  \'We are now,\' said he,\'half-way up the ascent of Vesuvius; there ought to be some cavern, orhollow in the vine-clad rocks, could we but find it, in which thedeserting Nymphs have left a shelter.\' While thus saying he moved fromthe trees, and, looking wistfully towards the mountain, discoveredthrough the advancing gloom a red and tremulous light at no considerabledistance. \'That must come,\' said he, \'from the hearth of some shepherdor vine-dresser--it will guide us to some hospitable retreat.  Wilt thoustay here, while I--yet no--that would be to leave thee to danger.\'\'I will go with you cheerfully,\' said Ione.  \'Open as the space seems,it is better than the treacherous shelter of these boughs.\'Half leading, half carrying Ione, Glaucus, accompanied by the tremblingfemale slave, advanced towards the light, which yet burned red andsteadfastly.  At length the space was no longer open; wild vinesentangled their steps, and hid from them, save by imperfect intervals,the guiding beam.  But faster and fiercer came the rain, and thelightning assumed its most deadly and blasting form; they were stilltherefore, impelled onward, hoping, at last, if the light eluded them,to arrive at some cottage or some friendly cavern.  The vines grew moreand more intricate--the light was entirely snatched from them; but anarrow path, which they trod with labor and pain, guided only by theconstant and long-lingering flashes of the storm, continued to lead themtowards its direction.  The rain ceased suddenly; precipitous and roughcrags of scorched lava frowned before them, rendered more fearful by thelightning that illumined the dark and dangerous soil.  Sometimes theblaze lingered over the iron-grey heaps of scoria, covered in part withancient mosses or stunted trees, as if seeking in vain for some gentlerproduct of earth, more worthy of its ire; and sometimes leaving thewhole of that part of the scene in darkness, the lightning, broad andsheeted, hung redly over the ocean, tossing far below, until its wavesseemed glowing into fire; and so intense was the blaze, that it broughtvividly into view even the sharp outline of the more distant windings ofthe bay, from the eternal Misenum, with its lofty brow, to the beautifulSorrentum and the giant hills behind.Our lovers stopped in perplexity and doubt, when suddenly, as thedarkness that gloomed between the fierce flashes of lightning once morewrapped them round, they saw near, but high, before them, the mysteriouslight.  Another blaze, in which heaven and earth were reddened, madevisible to them the whole expanse; no house was near, but just wherethey had beheld the light, they thought they saw in the recess of thecavern the outline of a human form.  The darkness once more returned;the light, no longer paled beneath the fires of heaven, burned forthagain: they resolved to ascend towards it; they had to wind their wayamong vast fragments of stone, here and there overhung with wild bushes;but they gained nearer and nearer to the light, and at length they stoodopposite the mouth of a kind of cavern, apparently formed by hugesplinters of rock that had fallen transversely athwart each other: and,looking into the gloom, each drew back involuntarily with asuperstitious fear and chill.A fire burned in the far recess of the cave; and over it was a smallcauldron; on a tall and thin column of iron stood a rude lamp; over thatpart of the wall, at the base of which burned the fire, hung in manyrows, as if to dry, a profusion of herbs and weeds.  A fox, couchedbefore the fire, gazed upon the strangers with its bright and redeye--its hair bristling--and a low growl stealing from between itsteeth; in the centre of the cave was an earthen statue, which had threeheads of a singular and fantastic cast: they were formed by the realskulls of a dog, a horse, and a boar; a low tripod stood before thiswild representation of the popular Hecate.But it was not these appendages and appliances of the cave that thrilledthe blood of those who gazed fearfully therein--it was the face of itsinmate. Before the fire, with the light shining full upon her features,sat a woman of considerable age.  Perhaps in no country are there seenso many hags as in Italy--in no country does beauty so awfully change,in age, to hideousness the most appalling and revolting.  But the oldwoman now before them was not one of these specimens of the extreme ofhuman ugliness; on the contrary, her countenance betrayed the remains ofa regular but high and aquiline order of feature: with stony eyes turnedupon them--with a look that met and fascinated theirs--they beheld inthat fearful countenance the very image of a corpse!--the same, theglazed and lustreless regard, the blue and shrunken lips, the drawn andhollow jaw--the dead, lank hair, of a pale grey--the livid, green,ghastly skin, which seemed all surely tinged and tainted by the grave!\'It is a dead thing,\' said Glaucus.\'Nay--it stirs--it is a ghost or larva,\' faltered Ione, as she clung tothe Athenian\'s breast.\'Oh, away, away!\' groaned the slave, \'it is the Witch of Vesuvius!\'\'Who are ye?\' said a hollow and ghostly voice.  \'And what do ye here?\'The sound, terrible and deathlike as it was--suiting well thecountenance of the speaker, and seeming rather the voice of somebodiless wanderer of the Styx than living mortal, would have made Ioneshrink back into the pitiless fury of the storm, but Glaucus, though notwithout some misgiving, drew her into the cavern.\'We are storm-beaten wanderers from the neighboring city,\' said he, \'anddecoyed hither by yon light; we crave shelter and the comfort of yourhearth.\'As he spoke, the fox rose from the ground, and advanced towards thestrangers, showing, from end to end, its white teeth, and deepening inits menacing growl.\'Down, slave!\' said the witch; and at the sound of her voice the beastdropped at once, covering its face with its brush, and keeping only itsquick, vigilant eye fixed upon the invaders of its repose. \'Come to thefire if ye will!\' said she, turning to Glaucus and his companions.  \'Inever welcome living thing--save the owl, the fox, the toad, and theviper--so I cannot welcome ye; but come to the fire without welcome--whystand upon form?\'The language in which the hag addressed them was a strange and barbarousLatin, interlarded with many words of some more rude, and ancientdialect. She did not stir from her seat, but gazed stonily upon them asGlaucus now released Ione of her outer wrapping garments, and making herplace herself on a log of wood, which was the only other seat heperceived at hand--fanned with his breath the embers into a more glowingflame.  The slave, encouraged by the boldness of her superiors, divestedherself also of her long palla, and crept timorously to the oppositecorner of the hearth.\'We disturb you, I fear,\' said the silver voice of Ione, inconciliation.The witch did not reply--she seemed like one who has awakened for amoment from the dead, and has then relapsed once more into the eternalslumber.\'Tell me,\' said she, suddenly, and after a long pause, \'are ye brotherand sister?\'\'No,\' said Ione, blushing.\'Are ye married?\'\'Not so,\' replied Glaucus.\'Ho, lovers!--ha!--ha!--ha!\' and the witch laughed so loud and so longthat the caverns rang again.The heart of Ione stood still at that strange mirth.  Glaucus muttered arapid counterspell to the omen--and the slave turned as pale as thecheek of the witch herself.\'Why dost thou laugh, old crone?\' said Glaucus, somewhat sternly, as heconcluded his invocation.\'Did I laugh?\' said the hag, absently.\'She is in her dotage,\' whispered Glaucus: as he said this, he caughtthe eye of the hag fixed upon him with a malignant and vivid glare.\'Thou liest!\' said she, abruptly.\'Thou art an uncourteous welcomer,\' returned Glaucus.\'Hush! provoke her not, dear Glaucus!\' whispered Ione.\'I will tell thee why I laughed when I discovered ye were lovers,\' saidthe old woman.  \'It was because it is a pleasure to the old and witheredto look upon young hearts like yours--and to know the time will comewhen you will loathe each other--loathe--loathe--ha!--ha!--ha!\'It was now Ione\'s turn to pray against the unpleasing prophecy.\'The gods forbid!\' said she.  \'Yet, poor woman, thou knowest little oflove, or thou wouldst know that it never changes.\'\'Was I young once, think ye?\' returned the hag, quickly; \'and am I old,and hideous, and deathly now?  Such as is the form, so is the heart.\'With these words she sank again into a stillness profound and fearful,as if the cessation of life itself.\'Hast thou dwelt here long?\' said Glaucus, after a pause, feelinguncomfortably oppressed beneath a silence so appalling.\'Ah, long!--yes.\'\'It is but a drear abode.\'\'Ha! thou mayst well say that--Hell is beneath us!\' replied the hag,pointing her bony finger to the earth.  \'And I will tell thee asecret--the dim things below are preparing wrath for ye above--you, theyoung, and the thoughtless, and the beautiful.\'\'Thou utterest but evil words, ill becoming the hospitable,\' saidGlaucus; \'and in future I will brave the tempest rather than thywelcome.\'\'Thou wilt do well.  None should ever seek me--save the wretched!\'\'And why the wretched?\' asked the Athenian.\'I am the witch of the mountain,\' replied the sorceress, with a ghastlygrin; \'my trade is to give hope to the hopeless: for the crossed in loveI have philtres; for the avaricious, promises of treasure; for themalicious, potions of revenge; for the happy and the good, I have onlywhat life has--curses!  Trouble me no more.With this the grim tenant of the cave relapsed into a silence soobstinate and sullen, that Glaucus in vain endeavored to draw her intofarther conversation.  She did not evince, by any alteration of herlocked and rigid features, that she even heard him.  Fortunately,however, the storm, which was brief as violent, began now to relax; therain grew less and less fierce; and at last, as the clouds parted, themoon burst forth in the purple opening of heaven, and streamed clear andfull into that desolate abode.  Never had she shone, perhaps, on a groupmore worthy of the painter\'s art.  The young, the all-beautiful Ione,seated by that rude fire--her lover already forgetful of the presence ofthe hag, at her feet, gazing upward to her face, and whispering sweetwords--the pale and affrighted slave at a little distance--and theghastly hag resting her deadly eyes upon them; yet seemingly serene andfearless (for the companionship of love hath such power) were thesebeautiful beings, things of another sphere, in that dark and unholycavern, with its gloomy quaintness of appurtenance.  The fox regardedthem from his corner with his keen and fiery eye: and as Glaucus nowturned towards the witch, he perceived for the first time, just underher seat, the bright gaze and crested head of a large snake: whether itwas that the vivid coloring of the Athenian\'s cloak, thrown over theshoulders of Ione, attracted the reptile\'s anger--its crest began toglow and rise, as if menacing and preparing itself to spring upon theNeapolitan--Glaucus caught quickly at one of the half-burned logs uponthe hearth--and, as if enraged at the action, the snake came forth fromits shelter, and with a loud hiss raised itself on end till its heightnearly approached that of the Greek.\'Witch!\' cried Glaucus, \'command thy creature, or thou wilt see itdead.\'\'It has been despoiled of its venom!\' said the witch, aroused at histhreat; but ere the words had left her lip, the snake had sprung uponGlaucus; quick and watchful, the agile Greek leaped lightly aside, andstruck so fell and dexterous a blow on the head of the snake, that itfell prostrate and writhing among the embers of the fire.The hag sprung up, and stood confronting Glaucus with a face which wouldhave befitted the fiercest of the Furies, so utterly dire and wrathfulwas its expression--yet even in horror and ghastliness preserving theoutline and trace of beauty--and utterly free from that coarse grotesqueat which the imaginations of the North have sought the source of terror.\'Thou hast,\' said she, in a slow and steady voice--which belied theexpression of her face, so much was it passionless and calm--\'thou hasthad shelter under my roof, and warmth at my hearth; thou hast returnedevil for good; thou hast smitten and haply slain the thing that loved meand was mine: nay, more, the creature, above all others, consecrated togods and deemed venerable by man,--now hear thy punishment.  By themoon, who is the guardian of the sorceress--by Orcus, who is thetreasurer of wrath--I curse thee! and thou art cursed!  May thy love beblasted--may thy name be blackened--may the infernals mark thee--may thyheart wither and scorch--may thy last hour recall to thee the prophetvoice of the Saga of Vesuvius!  And thou,\' she added, turning sharplytowards Ione, and raising her right arm, when Glaucus burst impetuouslyon her speech:\'Hag!\' cried he, \'forbear!  Me thou hast cursed, and I commit myself tothe gods--I defy and scorn thee! but breathe but one word against yonmaiden, and I will convert the oath on thy foul lips to thy dying groan.Beware!\'\'I have done,\' replied the hag, laughing wildly; \'for in thy doom is shewho loves thee accursed.  And not the less, that I heard her lipsbreathe thy name, and know by what word to commend thee to the demons.Glaucus--thou art doomed!\' So saying, the witch turned from theAthenian, and kneeling down beside her wounded favorite, which shedragged from the hearth, she turned to them her face no more.\'O Glaucus!\' said Ione, greatly terrified, \'what have we done?--Let ushasten from this place; the storm has ceased.  Good mistress, forgivehim--recall thy words--he meant but to defend himself--accept thispeace-offering to unsay the said\': and Ione, stooping, placed her purseon the hag\'s lap.\'Away!\' said she, bitterly--\'away!  The oath once woven the Fates onlycan untie.  Away!\'\'Come, dearest!\' said Glaucus, impatiently.  \'Thinkest thou that thegods above us or below hear the impotent ravings of dotage?  Come!\'Long and loud rang the echoes of the cavern with the dread laugh of theSaga--she deigned no further reply.The lovers breathed more freely when they gained the open air: yet thescene they had witnessed, the words and the laughter of the witch, stillfearfully dwelt with Ione; and even Glaucus could not thoroughly shakeoff the impression they bequeathed.  The storm had subsided--save, nowand then, a low thunder muttered at the distance amidst the darkerclouds, or a momentary flash of lightning affronted the sovereignty ofthe moon.  With some difficulty they regained the road, where they foundthe vehicle already sufficiently repaired for their departure, and thecarrucarius calling loudly upon Hercules to tell him where his chargehad vanished.Glaucus vainly endeavored to cheer the exhausted spirits of Ione; andscarce less vainly to recover the elastic tone of his own naturalgaiety.  They soon arrived before the gate of the city: as it opened tothem, a litter borne by slaves impeded the way.\'It is too late for egress,\' cried the sentinel to the inmate of thelitter.\'Not so,\' said a voice, which the lovers started to hear; it was a voicethey well recognized.  \'I am bound to the villa of Marcus Polybius.  Ishall return shortly.  I am Arbaces the Egyptian.\'The scruples of him at the gate were removed, and the litter passedclose beside the carriage that bore the lovers.\'Arbaces, at this hour!--scarce recovered too, methinks!--Whither andfor what can he leave the city?\' said Glaucus.\'Alas!\' replied Ione, bursting into tears, \'my soul feels still more andmore the omen of evil.  Preserve us, O ye Gods! or at least,\' shemurmured inly, \'preserve my Glaucus!\'Chapter XTHE LORD OF THE BURNING BELT AND HIS MINION.  FATE WRITES HER PROPHECYIN RED LETTERS, BUT WHO SHALL READ THEM?ARBACES had tarried only till the cessation of the tempest allowed him,under cover of night, to seek the Saga of Vesuvius.  Borne by those ofhis trustier slaves in whom in all more secret expeditions he wasaccustomed to confide, he lay extended along his litter, and resigninghis sanguine heart to the contemplation of vengeance gratified and lovepossessed.  The slaves in so short a journey moved very little slowerthan the ordinary pace of mules; and Arbaces soon arrived at thecommencement of a narrow path, which the lovers had not been fortunateenough to discover; but which, skirting the thick vines, led at once tothe habitation of the witch.  Here he rested the litter; and bidding hisslaves conceal themselves and the vehicle among the vines from theobservation of any chance passenger, he mounted alone, with steps stillfeeble but supported by a long staff, the drear and sharp ascent.Not a drop of rain fell from the tranquil heaven; but the moisturedripped mournfully from the laden boughs of the vine, and now and thencollected in tiny pools in the crevices and hollows of the rocky way.\'Strange passions these for a philosopher,\' thought Arbaces, \'that leadone like me just new from the bed of death, and lapped even in healthamidst the roses of luxury, across such nocturnal paths as this; butPassion and Vengeance treading to their goal can make an Elysium of aTartarus.\' High, clear, and melancholy shone the moon above the road ofthat dark wayfarer, glossing herself in every pool that lay before him,and sleeping in shadow along the sloping mount. He saw before him thesame light that had guided the steps of his intended victims, but, nolonger contrasted by the blackened clouds, it shone less redly clear.He paused, as at length he approached the mouth of the cavern, torecover breath; and then, with his wonted collected and stately mien, hecrossed the unhallowed threshold.The fox sprang up at the ingress of this newcomer, and by a long howlannounced another visitor to his mistress.The witch had resumed her seat, and her aspect of gravelike and grimrepose. By her feet, upon a bed of dry weeds which half covered it, laythe wounded snake; but the quick eye of the Egyptian caught its scalesglittering in the reflected light of the opposite fire, as itwrithed--now contracting, now lengthening, its folds, in pain andunsated anger.\'Down, slave!\' said the witch, as before, to the fox; and, as before,the animal dropped to the ground--mute, but vigilant.\'Rise, servant of Nox and Erebus!\' said Arbaces, commandingly; \'asuperior in thine art salutes thee! rise, and welcome him.\'At these words the hag turned her gaze upon the Egyptian\'s towering formand dark features.  She looked long and fixedly upon him, as he stoodbefore her in his Oriental robe, and folded arms, and steadfast andhaughty brow.  \'Who art thou,\' she said at last, \'that callest thyselfgreater in art than the Saga of the Burning Fields, and the daughter ofthe perished Etrurian race?\'\'I am he,\' answered Arbaces, \'from whom all cultivators of magic, fromnorth to south, from east to west, from the Ganges and the Nile to thevales of Thessaly and the shores of the yellow Tiber, have stooped tolearn.\'\'There is but one such man in these places,\' answered the witch, \'whomthe men of the outer world, unknowing his loftier attributes and moresecret fame, call Arbaces the Egyptian: to us of a higher nature anddeeper knowledge, his rightful appellation is Hermes of the BurningGirdle.\'\'Look again, returned Arbaces: \'I am he.\'As he spoke he drew aside his robe, and revealed a cincture seemingly offire, that burned around his waist, clasped in the centre by a platewhereon was engraven some sign apparently vague and unintelligible butwhich was evidently not unknown to the Saga.  She rose hastily, andthrew herself at the feet of Arbaces.  \'I have seen, then,\' said she, ina voice of deep humility, \'the Lord of the Mighty Girdle--vouchsafe myhomage.\'\'Rise,\' said the Egyptian; \'I have need of thee.\'So saying, he placed himself on the same log of wood on which Ione hadrested before, and motioned to the witch to resume her seat.\'Thou sayest,\' said he, as she obeyed, \'that thou art a daughter of theancient Etrurian tribes; the mighty walls of whose rock-built cities yetfrown above the robber race that hath seized upon their ancient reign.Partly came those tribes from Greece, partly were they exiles from amore burning and primeval soil.  In either case art thou of Egyptianlineage, for the Grecian masters of the aboriginal helot were among therestless sons whom the Nile banished from her bosom.  Equally, then, OSaga! thy descent is from ancestors that swore allegiance to mine own.By birth as by knowledge, art thou the subject of Arbaces.  Hear me,then, and obey!\'The witch bowed her head.\'Whatever art we possess in sorcery,\' continued Arbaces, \'we aresometimes driven to natural means to attain our object.  The ring andthe crystal, and the ashes and the herbs, do not give unerringdivinations; neither do the higher mysteries of the moon yield even thepossessor of the girdle a dispensation from the necessity of employingever and anon human measures for a human object.  Mark me, then: thouart deeply skilled, methinks, in the secrets of the more deadly herbs;thou knowest those which arrest life, which burn and scorch the soulfrom out her citadel, or freeze the channels of young blood into thatice which no sun can melt.  Do I overrate thy skill?  Speak, and truly!\'\'Mighty Hermes, such lore is, indeed, mine own.  Deign to look at theseghostly and corpse-like features; they have waned from the hues of lifemerely by watching over the rank herbs which simmer night and day in yoncauldron.\'The Egyptian moved his seat from so unblessed or so unhealthful avicinity as the witch spoke.\'It is well,\' said he; \'thou hast learned that maxim of all the deeperknowledge which saith, ""Despise the body to make wise the mind."" But tothy task.  There cometh to thee by to-morrow\'s starlight a vain maiden,seeking of thine art a love-charm to fascinate from another the eyesthat should utter but soft tales to her own: instead of thy philtres,give the maiden one of thy most powerful poisons.  Let the lover breathehis vows to the Shades.\'The witch trembled from head to foot.\'Oh pardon! pardon! dread master,\' said she, falteringly, \'but this Idare not.  The law in these cities is sharp and vigilant; they willseize, they will slay me.\'\'For what purpose, then, thy herbs and thy potions, vain Saga?\' saidArbaces, sneeringly.The witch hid her loathsome face with her hands.\'Oh! years ago,\' said she, in a voice unlike her usual tones, soplaintive was it, and so soft, \'I was not the thing that I am now.  Iloved, I fancied myself beloved.\'\'And what connection hath thy love, witch, with my commands?\' saidArbaces, impetuously.\'Patience,\' resumed the witch; \'patience, I implore.  I loved! anotherand less fair than I--yes, by Nemesis! less fair--allured from me mychosen.  I was of that dark Etrurian tribe to whom most of all wereknown the secrets of the gloomier magic.  My mother was herself a saga:she shared the resentment of her child; from her hands I received thepotion that was to restore me his love; and from her, also, the poisonthat was to destroy my rival.  Oh, crush me, dread walls! my tremblinghands mistook the phials, my lover fell indeed at my feet; but dead!dead! dead!  Since then, what has been life to me I became suddenly old,I devoted myself to the sorceries of my race; still by an irresistibleimpulse I curse myself with an awful penance; still I seek the mostnoxious herbs; still I concoct the poisons; still I imagine that I am togive them to my hated rival; still I pour them into the phial; still Ifancy that they shall blast her beauty to the dust; still I wake and seethe quivering body, the foaming lips, the glazing eyes of myAulus--murdered, and by me!\'The skeleton frame of the witch shook beneath strong convulsions.Arbaces gazed upon her with a curious though contemptuous eye.\'And this foul thing has yet human emotions!\' thought he; \'still shecowers over the ashes of the same fire that consumes Arbaces!--Such arewe all! Mystic is the tie of those mortal passions that unite thegreatest and the least.\'He did not reply till she had somewhat recovered herself, and now satrocking to and fro in her seat, with glassy eyes fixed on the oppositeflame, and large tears rolling down her livid cheeks.\'A grievous tale is thine, in truth,\' said Arbaces.  \'But these emotionsare fit only for our youth--age should harden our hearts to all thingsbut ourselves; as every year adds a scale to the shell-fish, so shouldeach year wall and incrust the heart.  Think of those frenzies no more!And now, listen to me again!  By the revenge that was dear to thee, Icommand thee to obey me! it is for vengeance that I seek thee!  Thisyouth whom I would sweep from my path has crossed me, despite myspells:--this thing of purple and broidery, of smiles and glances,soulless and mindless, with no charm but that of beauty--accursed beit!--this insect--this Glaucus--I tell thee, by Orcus and by Nemesis, hemust die.\'And working himself up at every word, the Egyptian, forgetful of hisdebility--of his strange companion--of everything but his own vindictiverage, strode, with large and rapid steps, the gloomy cavern.\'Glaucus! saidst thou, mighty master!\' said the witch, abruptly; and herdim eye glared at the name with all that fierce resentment at the memoryof small affronts so common amongst the solitary and the shunned.\'Ay, so he is called; but what matters the name?  Let it not be heard asthat of a living man three days from this date!\'\'Hear me!\' said the witch, breaking from a short reverie into which shewas plunged after this last sentence of the Egyptian. \'Hear me! I am thything and thy slave! spare me!  If I give to the maiden thou speakest ofthat which would destroy the life of Glaucus, I shall be surelydetected--the dead ever find avengers.  Nay, dread man! if thy visit tome be tracked, if thy hatred to Glaucus be known, thou mayest have needof thy archest magic to protect thyself!\'\'Ha!\' said Arbaces, stopping suddenly short; and as a proof of thatblindness with which passion darkens the eyes even of the most acute,this was the first time when the risk that he himself ran by this methodof vengeance had occurred to a mind ordinarily wary and circumspect.\'But,\' continued the witch, \'if instead of that which shall arrest theheart, I give that which shall sear and blast the brain--which shallmake him who quaffs it unfit for the uses and career of life--an abject,raving, benighted thing--smiting sense to drivelling youth todotage--will not thy vengeance be equally sated--thy object equallyattained?\'\'Oh, witch! no longer the servant, but the sister--the equal ofArbaces--how much brighter is woman\'s wit, even in vengeance, than ours!how much more exquisite than death is such a doom!\'\'And,\' continued the hag, gloating over her fell scheme, \'in this is butlittle danger; for by ten thousand methods, which men forbear to seek,can our victim become mad.  He may have been among the vines and seen anymph--or the vine itself may have had the same effect--ha, ha! theynever inquire too scrupulously into these matters in which the gods maybe agents. And let the worst arrive--let it be known that it is alove-charm--why, madness is a common effect of philtres; and even thefair she that gave it finds indulgence in the excuse. Mighty Hermes,have I ministered to thee cunningly?\'\'Thou shalt have twenty years\' longer date for this,\' returned Arbaces.\'I will write anew the epoch of thy fate on the face of the palestars--thou shalt not serve in vain the Master of the Flaming Belt.  Andhere, Saga, carve thee out, by these golden tools, a warmer cell in thisdreary cavern--one service to me shall countervail a thousanddivinations by sieve and shears to the gaping rustics.\' So saying, hecast upon the floor a heavy purse, which clinked not unmusically to theear of the hag, who loved the consciousness of possessing the means topurchase comforts she disdained. \'Farewell,\' said Arbaces, \'failnot--outwatch the stars in concocting thy beverage--thou shalt lord itover thy sisters at the Walnut-tree,\' when thou tellest them that thypatron and thy friend is Hermes the Egyptian. To-morrow night we meetagain.\'He stayed not to hear the valediction or the thanks of the witch; with aquick step he passed into the moonlit air, and hastened down themountain.The witch, who followed his steps to the threshold, stood at theentrance of the cavern, gazing fixedly on his receding form; and as thesad moonlight streamed over her shadowy form and deathlike face,emerging from the dismal rocks, it seemed as if one gifted, indeed, bysupernatural magic had escaped from the dreary Orcus; and, the foremostof its ghostly throng, stood at its black portals--vainly summoning hisreturn, or vainly sighing to rejoin him. The hag, then slowlyre-entering the cave, groaningly picked up the heavy purse, took thelamp from its stand, and, passing to the remotest depth of her cell, ablack and abrupt passage, which was not visible, save at a nearapproach, closed round as it was with jutting and sharp crags, yawnedbefore her: she went several yards along this gloomy path, which slopedgradually downwards, as if towards the bowels of the earth, and, liftinga stone, deposited her treasure in a hole beneath, which, as the lamppierced its secrets, seemed already to contain coins of various value,wrung from the credulity or gratitude of her visitors.\'I love to look at you,\' said she, apostrophising the moneys; \'for whenI see you I feel that I am indeed of power.  And I am to have twentyyears\' longer life to increase your store! O thou great Hermes!\'She replaced the stone, and continued her path onward for some paces,when she stopped before a deep irregular fissure in the earth.  Here, asshe bent--strange, rumbling, hoarse, and distant sounds might be heard,while ever and anon, with a loud and grating noise which, to use ahomely but faithful simile, seemed to resemble the grinding of steelupon wheels, volumes of streaming and dark smoke issued forth, andrushed spirally along the cavern.\'The Shades are noisier than their wont,\' said the hag, shaking her greylocks; and, looking into the cavity, she beheld, far down, glimpses of along streak of light, intensely but darkly red. \'Strange!\' she said,shrinking back; \'it is only within the last two days that dull, deeplight hath been visible--what can it portend?\'The fox, who had attended the steps of his fell mistress, uttered adismal howl, and ran cowering back to the inner cave; a cold shudderingseized the hag herself at the cry of the animal, which, causeless as itseemed, the superstitions of the time considered deeply ominous.  Shemuttered her placatory charm, and tottered back into her cavern, where,amidst her herbs and incantations, she prepared to execute the orders ofthe Egyptian.\'He called me dotard,\' said she, as the smoke curled from the hissingcauldron: \'when the jaws drop, and the grinders fall, and the heartscarce beats, it is a pitiable thing to dote; but when,\' she added, witha savage and exulting grin, \'the young, and the beautiful, and thestrong, are suddenly smitten into idiocy--ah, that is terrible!  Burn,flame--simmer herb--swelter toad--I cursed him, and he shall be cursed!\'On that night, and at the same hour which witnessed the dark and unholyinterview between Arbaces and the Saga, Apaecides was baptized.Chapter XIPROGRESS OF EVENTS.  THE PLOT THICKENS.  THE WEB IS WOVEN, BUT THE NETCHANGES HANDS.\'AND you have the courage then, Julia, to seek the Witch of Vesuviusthis evening; in company, too, with that fearful man?\'\'Why, Nydia?\' replied Julia, timidly; \'dost thou really think there isanything to dread?  These old hags, with their enchanted mirrors, theirtrembling sieves, and their moon-gathered herbs, are, I imagine, butcrafty impostors, who have learned, perhaps, nothing but the very charmfor which I apply to their skill, and which is drawn but from theknowledge of the field\'s herbs and simples. Wherefore should I dread?\'\'Dost thou not fear thy companion?\'\'What, Arbaces?  By Dian, I never saw lover more courteous than thatsame magician!  And were he not so dark, he would be even handsome.\'Blind as she was, Nydia had the penetration to perceive that Julia\'smind was not one that the gallantries of Arbaces were likely to terrify.She therefore dissuaded her no more: but nursed in her excited heart thewild and increasing desire to know if sorcery had indeed a spell tofascinate love to love.\'Let me go with thee, noble Julia,\' said she at length; \'my presence isno protection, but I should like to be beside thee to the last.\'\'Thine offer pleases me much,\' replied the daughter of Diomed. \'Yet howcanst thou contrive it? we may not return until late, they will missthee.\'\'Ione is indulgent,\' replied Nydia.  \'If thou wilt permit me to sleepbeneath thy roof, I will say that thou, an early patroness and friend,hast invited me to pass the day with thee, and sing thee my Thessaliansongs; her courtesy will readily grant to thee so light a boon.\'\'Nay, ask for thyself!\' said the haughty Julia.  \'I stoop to request nofavor from the Neapolitan!\'\'Well, be it so.  I will take my leave now; make my request, which Iknow will be readily granted, and return shortly.\'\'Do so; and thy bed shall be prepared in my own chamber.\' With that,Nydia left the fair Pompeian.On her way back to Ione she was met by the chariot of Glaucus, on whosefiery and curveting steeds was riveted the gaze of the crowded street.He kindly stopped for a moment to speak to the flower-girl.\'Blooming as thine own roses, my gentle Nydia! and how is thy fairmistress?--recovered, I trust, from the effects of the storm?\'\'I have not seen her this morning,\' answered Nydia, \'but...\'\'But what? draw back--the horses are too near thee.\'\'But think you Ione will permit me to pass the day with Julia, thedaughter of Diomed?--She wishes it, and was kind to me when I had fewfriends.\'\'The gods bless thy grateful heart!  I will answer for Ione\'spermission.\'\'Then I may stay over the night, and return to-morrow?\' said Nydia,shrinking from the praise she so little merited.\'As thou and fair Julia please.  Commend me to her; and hark ye, Nydia,when thou hearest her speak, note the contrast of her voice with that ofthe silver-toned Ione.  Vale!\'His spirits entirely recovered from the effect of the past night, hislocks waving in the wind, his joyous and elastic heart bounding withevery spring of his Parthian steeds, a very prototype of his country\'sgod, full of youth and of love--Glaucus was borne rapidly to hismistress.Enjoy while ye may the present--who can read the future?As the evening darkened, Julia, reclined within her litter, which wascapacious enough also to admit her blind companion, took her way to therural baths indicated by Arbaces.  To her natural levity of disposition,her enterprise brought less of terror than of pleasurable excitement;above all, she glowed at the thought of her coming triumph over thehated Neapolitan.A small but gay group was collected round the door of the villa, as herlitter passed by it to the private entrance of the baths appropriated tothe women.\'Methinks, by this dim light,\' said one of the bystanders, \'I recognizethe slaves of Diomed.\'\'True, Clodius,\' said Sallust: \'it is probably the litter of hisdaughter Julia.  She is rich, my friend; why dost thou not proffer thysuit to her?\'\'Why, I had once hoped that Glaucus would have married her.  She doesnot disguise her attachment; and then, as he gambles freely and withill-success...\'\'The sesterces would have passed to thee, wise Clodius.  A wife is agood thing--when it belongs to another man!\'\'But,\' continued Clodius, \'as Glaucus is, I understand, to wed theNeapolitan, I think I must even try my chance with the dejected maid.After all, the lamp of Hymen will be gilt, and the vessel will reconcileone to the odor of the flame.  I shall only protest, my Sallust, againstDiomed\'s making thee trustee to his daughter\'s fortune.\'\'Ha! ha! let us within, my comissator; the wine and the garlands waitus.\'Dismissing her slaves to that part of the house set apart for theirentertainment, Julia entered the baths with Nydia, and declining theoffers of the attendants, passed by a private door into the gardenbehind.\'She comes by appointment, be sure,\' said one of the slaves.\'What is that to thee?\' said a superintendent, sourly; \'she pays for thebaths, and does not waste the saffron.  Such appointments are the bestpart of the trade.  Hark! do you not hear the widow Fulvia clapping herhands? Run, fool--run!\'Julia and Nydia, avoiding the more public part of the garden, arrived atthe place specified by the Egyptian.  In a small circular plot of grassthe stars gleamed upon the statue of Silenus--the merry god reclinedupon a fragment of rock--the lynx of Bacchus at his feet--and over hismouth he held, with extended arm, a bunch of grapes, which he seeminglylaughed to welcome ere he devoured.\'I see not the magician,\' said Julia, looking round: when, as she spoke,the Egyptian slowly emerged from the neighboring foliage, and the lightfell palely over his sweeping robes.\'Salve, sweet maiden!--But ha! whom hast thou here? we must have nocompanions!\'\'It is but the blind flower-girl, wise magician,\' replied Julia:\'herself a Thessalian.\'\'Oh! Nydia!\' said the Egyptian.  \'I know her well.\'Nydia drew back and shuddered.\'Thou hast been at my house, methinks!\' said he, approaching his voiceto Nydia\'s ear; \'thou knowest the oath!--Silence and secrecy, now asthen, or beware!\'\'Yet,\' he added, musingly to himself, \'why confide more than isnecessary, even in the blind--Julia, canst thou trust thyself alone withme?  Believe me, the magician is less formidable than he seems.\'As he spoke, he gently drew Julia aside.\'The witch loves not many visitors at once,\' said he: \'leave Nydia heretill your return; she can be of no assistance to us: and, forprotection--your own beauty suffices--your own beauty and your own rank;yes, Julia, I know thy name and birth.  Come, trust thyself with me,fair rival of the youngest of the Naiads!\'The vain Julia was not, as we have seen, easily affrighted; she wasmoved by the flattery of Arbaces, and she readily consented to sufferNydia to await her return; nor did Nydia press her presence.  At thesound of the Egyptian\'s voice all her terror of him returned: she felt asentiment of pleasure at learning she was not to travel in hiscompanionship.She returned to the Bath-house, and in one of the private chamberswaited their return.  Many and bitter were the thoughts of this wildgirl as she sat there in her eternal darkness.  She thought of her owndesolate fate, far from her native land, far from the bland cares thatonce assuaged the April sorrows of childhood--deprived of the light ofday, with none but strangers to guide her steps, accursed by the onesoft feeling of her heart, loving and without hope, save the dim andunholy ray which shot across her mind, as her Thessalian fanciesquestioned of the force of spells and the gifts of magic.Nature had sown in the heart of this poor girl the seeds of virtuenever destined to ripen.  The lessons of adversity are not alwayssalutary--sometimes they soften and amend, but as often they indurateand pervert. If we consider ourselves more harshly treated by fate thanthose around us, and do not acknowledge in our own deeds the justice ofthe severity, we become too apt to deem the world our enemy, to caseourselves in defiance, to wrestle against our softer self, and toindulge the darker passions which are so easily fermented by the senseof injustice.  Sold early into slavery, sentenced to a sordidtaskmaster, exchanging her situation, only yet more to embitter herlot--the kindlier feelings, naturally profuse in the breast of Nydia,were nipped and blighted.  Her sense of right and wrong was confused bya passion to which she had so madly surrendered herself; and the sameintense and tragic emotions which we read of in the women of the classicage--a Myrrha, a Medea--and which hurried and swept away the whole soulwhen once delivered to love--ruled, and rioted in, her breast.Time passed: a light step entered the chamber where Nydia yet indulgedher gloomy meditations.\'Oh, thanked be the immortal gods!\' said Julia, \'I have returned, I haveleft that terrible cavern!  Come, Nydia! let us away forthwith!\'It was not till they were seated in the litter that Julia again spoke.\'Oh!\' said she, tremblingly, \'such a scene! such fearful incantations!and the dead face of the hag!--But, let us talk not of it.  I haveobtained the potion--she pledges its effect.  My rival shall be suddenlyindifferent to his eye, and I, I alone, the idol of Glaucus!\'\'Glaucus!\' exclaimed Nydia.\'Ay! I told thee, girl, at first, that it was not the Athenian whom Iloved: but I see now that I may trust thee wholly--it is the beautifulGreek!\'What then were Nydia\'s emotions! she had connived, she had assisted, intearing Glaucus from Ione; but only to transfer, by all the power ofmagic, his affections yet more hopelessly to another.  Her heart swelledalmost to suffocation--she gasped for breath--in the darkness of thevehicle, Julia did not perceive the agitation of her companion; she wenton rapidly dilating on the promised effect of her acquisition, and onher approaching triumph over Ione, every now and then abruptlydigressing to the horror of the scene she had quitted--the unmoved mienof Arbaces, and his authority over the dreadful Saga.Meanwhile Nydia recovered her self-possession: a thought flashed acrossher: she slept in the chamber of Julia--she might possess herself of thepotion.They arrived at the house of Diomed, and descended to Julia\'s apartment,where the night\'s repast awaited them.\'Drink, Nydia, thou must be cold, the air was chill to-night; as for me,my veins are yet ice.\'And Julia unhesitatingly quaffed deep draughts of the spiced wine.\'Thou hast the potion,\' said Nydia; \'let me hold it in my hands. Howsmall the phial is! of what color is the draught?\'\'Clear as crystal,\' replied Julia, as she retook the philtre; \'thoucouldst not tell it from this water.  The witch assures me it istasteless.  Small though the phial, it suffices for a life\'s fidelity:it is to be poured into any liquid; and Glaucus will only know what hehas quaffed by the effect.\'\'Exactly like this water in appearance?\'\'Yes, sparkling and colorless as this.  How bright it seems! it is asthe very essence of moonlit dews.  Bright thing! how thou shinest on myhopes through thy crystal vase!\'\'And how is it sealed?\'\'But by one little stopper--I withdraw it now--the draught gives noodor. Strange, that that which speaks to neither sense should thuscommand all!\'\'Is the effect instantaneous?\'\'Usually--but sometimes it remains dormant for a few hours.\'\'Oh, how sweet is this perfume!\' said Nydia, suddenly, as she took up asmall bottle on the table, and bent over its fragrant contents.\'Thinkest thou so? the bottle is set with gems of some value.  Thouwouldst not have the bracelet yestermorn--wilt thou take the bottle?\'\'It ought to be such perfumes as these that should remind one who cannotsee of the generous Julia.  If the bottle be not too costly...\'\'Oh! I have a thousand costlier ones: take it, child!\'Nydia bowed her gratitude, and placed the bottle in her vest.\'And the draught would be equally efficacious, whoever administers it?\'\'If the most hideous hag beneath the sun bestowed it, such is itsasserted virtue that Glaucus would deem her beautiful, and none buther!\'Julia, warmed by wine, and the reaction of her spirits, was now allanimation and delight; she laughed loud, and talked on a hundredmatters--nor was it till the night had advanced far towards morning thatshe summoned her slaves and undressed.When they were dismissed, she said to Nydia, \'I will not suffer thisholy draught to quit my presence till the hour comes for its use. Lieunder my pillow, bright spirit, and give me happy dreams!\'So saying, she placed the potion under her pillow.  Nydia\'s heart beatviolently.\'Why dost thou drink that unmixed water, Nydia?  Take the wine by itsside.\'\'I am fevered,\' replied the blind girl, \'and the water cools me.  I willplace this bottle by my bedside, it refreshes in these summer nights,when the dews of sleep fall not on our lips.  Fair Julia, I must leavethee very early--so Ione bids--perhaps before thou art awake; accept,therefore, now my congratulations.\'\'Thanks: when next we meet you may find Glaucus at my feet.\'They had retired to their couches, and Julia, worn out by the excitementof the day, soon slept.  But anxious and burning thoughts rolled overthe mind of the wakeful Thessalian.  She listened to the calm breathingof Julia; and her ear, accustomed to the finest distinctions of sound,speedily assured her of the deep slumber of her companion.\'Now befriend me, Venus!\' said she, softly.She rose gently, and poured the perfume from the gift of Julia upon themarble floor--she rinsed it several times carefully with the water thatwas beside her, and then easily finding the bed of Julia (for night toher was as day), she pressed her trembling hand under the pillow andseized the potion.  Julia stirred not, her breath regularly fanned theburning cheek of the blind girl.  Nydia, then, opening the phial, pouredits contents into the bottle, which easily contained them; and thenrefilling the former reservoir of the potion with that limpid waterwhich Julia had assured her it so resembled, she once more placed thephial in its former place.  She then stole again to her couch, andwaited--with what thoughts!--the dawning day.The sun had risen--Julia slept still--Nydia noiselessly dressed herself,placed her treasure carefully in her vest, took up her staff, andhastened to quit the house.The porter, Medon, saluted her kindly as she descended the steps thatled to the street: she heard him not; her mind was confused and lost inthe whirl of tumultuous thoughts, each thought a passion. She felt thepure morning air upon her cheek, but it cooled not her scorching veins.\'Glaucus,\' she murmured, \'all the love-charms of the wildest magic couldnot make thee love me as I love thee.  Ione!--ah; away hesitation! awayremorse! Glaucus, my fate is in thy smile; and thine! hope!  O joy!  Otransport, thy fate is in these hands!\'BOOK THE FOURTHChapter IREFLECTIONS ON THE ZEAL OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS.  TWO MEN COME TO APERILOUS RESOLVE.  WALLS HAVE EARS, PARTICULARLY SACRED WALLS.WHOEVER regards the early history of Christianity, will perceive hownecessary to its triumph was that fierce spirit of zeal, which, fearingno danger, accepting no compromise, inspired its champions and sustainedits martyrs.  In a dominant Church the genius of intolerance betrays itscause--in a weak and persecuted Church, the same genius mainly supports.It was necessary to scorn, to loathe, to abhor the creeds of other men,in order to conquer the temptations which they presented--it wasnecessary rigidly to believe not only that the Gospel was the truefaith, but the sole true faith that saved, in order to nerve thedisciple to the austerity of its doctrine, and to encourage him to thesacred and perilous chivalry of converting the Polytheist and theHeathen.  The sectarian sternness which confined virtue and heaven to achosen few, which saw demons in other gods, and the penalties of hell inother religions--made the believer naturally anxious to convert all towhom he felt the ties of human affection; and the circle thus traced bybenevolence to man was yet more widened by a desire for the glory ofGod.  It was for the honour of the Christian faith that the Christianboldly forced its tenets upon the scepticism of some, the repugnance ofothers, the sage contempt of the philosopher, the pious shudder of thepeople--his very intolerance supplied him with his fittest instrumentsof success; and the soft Heathen began at last to imagine there mustindeed be something holy in a zeal wholly foreign to his experience,which stopped at no obstacle, dreaded no danger, and even at thetorture, or on the scaffold, referred a dispute far other than the calmdifferences of speculative philosophy to the tribunal of an EternalJudge.  It was thus that the same fervor which made the Churchman of themiddle age a bigot without mercy, made the Christian of the early days ahero without fear.Of these more fiery, daring, and earnest natures, not the least ardentwas Olinthus.  No sooner had Apaecides been received by the rites ofbaptism into the bosom of the Church, than the Nazarene hastened to makehim conscious of the impossibility to retain the office and robes ofpriesthood. He could not, it was evident, profess to worship God, andcontinue even outwardly to honour the idolatrous altars of the Fiend.Nor was this all, the sanguine and impetuous mind of Olinthus beheld inthe power of Apaecides the means of divulging to the deluded people thejuggling mysteries of the oracular Isis.  He thought Heaven had sentthis instrument of his design in order to disabuse the eyes of thecrowd, and prepare the way, perchance, for the conversion of a wholecity.  He did not hesitate then to appeal to all the new-kindledenthusiasm of Apaecides, to arouse his courage, and to stimulate hiszeal.  They met, according to previous agreement, the evening after thebaptism of Apaecides, in the grove of Cybele, which we have beforedescribed.\'At the next solemn consultation of the oracle,\' said Olinthus, as heproceeded in the warmth of his address, \'advance yourself to therailing, proclaim aloud to the people the deception they endure, invitethem to enter, to be themselves the witness of the gross but artfulmechanism of imposture thou hast described to me.  Fear not--the Lord,who protected Daniel, shall protect thee; we, the community ofChristians, will be amongst the crowd; we will urge on the shrinking:and in the first flush of the popular indignation and shame, I myself,upon those very altars, will plant the palm-branch typical of theGospel--and to my tongue shall descend the rushing Spirit of the livingGod.\'Heated and excited as he was, this suggestion was not unpleasing toApaecides.  He was rejoiced at so early an opportunity of distinguishinghis faith in his new sect, and to his holier feelings were added thoseof a vindictive loathing at the imposition he had himself suffered, anda desire to avenge it.  In that sanguine and elastic overbound ofobstacles (the rashness necessary to all who undertake venturous andlofty actions), neither Olinthus nor the proselyte perceived theimpediments to the success of their scheme, which might be found in thereverent superstition of the people themselves, who would probably beloth, before the sacred altars of the great Egyptian goddess, to believeeven the testimony of her priest against her power.Apaecides then assented to this proposal with a readiness whichdelighted Olinthus.  They parted with the understanding that Olinthusshould confer with the more important of his Christian brethren on hisgreat enterprise, should receive their advice and the assurances oftheir support on the eventful day.  It so chanced that one of thefestivals of Isis was to be held on the second day after thisconference.  The festival proffered a ready occasion for the design.They appointed to meet once more on the next evening at the same spot;and in that meeting were finally to be settled the order and details ofthe disclosure for the following day.It happened that the latter part of this conference had been held nearthe sacellum, or small chapel, which I have described in the early partof this work; and so soon as the forms of the Christian and the priesthad disappeared from the grove, a dark and ungainly figure emerged frombehind the chapel.\'I have tracked you with some effect, my brother flamen,\' soliloquisedthe eavesdropper; \'you, the priest of Isis, have not for mere idlediscussion conferred with this gloomy Christian.  Alas! that I could nothear all your precious plot: enough!  I find, at least, that youmeditate revealing the sacred mysteries, and that to-morrow you meetagain at this place to plan the how and the when. May Osiris sharpen myears then, to detect the whole of your unheard-of audacity!  When I havelearned more, I must confer at once with Arbaces.  We will frustrateyou, my friends, deep as you think yourselves.  At present, my breast isa locked treasury of your secret.\'Thus muttering, Calenus, for it was he, wrapped his robe round him, andstrode thoughtfully homeward.Chapter IIA CLASSIC HOST, COOK, AND KITCHEN.  APAECIDES SEEKS IONE.  THEIRCONVERSATION.IT was then the day for Diomed\'s banquet to the most select of hisfriends. The graceful Glaucus, the beautiful Ione, the official Pansa,the high-born Clodius, the immortal Fulvius, the exquisite Lepidus, theepicurean Sallust, were not the only honourers of his festival.  Heexpected, also, an invalid senator from Rome (a man of considerablerepute and favor at court), and a great warrior from Herculaneum, whohad fought with Titus against the Jews, and having enriched himselfprodigiously in the wars, was always told by his friends that hiscountry was eternally indebted to his disinterested exertions!  Theparty, however, extended to a yet greater number: for although,critically speaking, it was, at one time, thought inelegant among theRomans to entertain less than three or more than nine at their banquets,yet this rule was easily disregarded by the ostentatious. And we aretold, indeed, in history, that one of the most splendid of theseentertainers usually feasted a select party of three hundred. Diomed,however, more modest, contented himself with doubling the number of theMuses.  His party consisted of eighteen, no unfashionable number in thepresent day.It was the morning of Diomed\'s banquet; and Diomed himself, though hegreatly affected the gentleman and the scholar, retained enough of hismercantile experience to know that a master\'s eye makes a ready servant.Accordingly, with his tunic ungirdled on his portly stomach, his easyslippers on his feet, a small wand in his hand, wherewith he nowdirected the gaze, and now corrected the back, of some duller menial, hewent from chamber to chamber of his costly villa.He did not disdain even a visit to that sacred apartment in which thepriests of the festival prepare their offerings.  On entering thekitchen, his ears were agreeably stunned by the noise of dishes andpans, of oaths and commands.  Small as this indispensable chamber seemsto have been in all the houses of Pompeii, it was, nevertheless, usuallyfitted up with all that amazing variety of stoves and shapes, stew-pansand saucepans, cutters and moulds, without which a cook of spirit, nomatter whether he be an ancient or a modern, declares it utterlyimpossible that he can give you anything to eat. And as fuel was then,as now, dear and scarce in those regions, great seems to have been thedexterity exercised in preparing as many things as possible with aslittle fire.  An admirable contrivance of this nature may be still seenin the Neapolitan Museum, viz., a portable kitchen, about the size of afolio volume, containing stoves for four dishes, and an apparatus forheating water or other beverages.Across the small kitchen flitted many forms which the quick eye of themaster did not recognize.\'Oh! oh!\' grumbled he to himself, \'that cursed Congrio hath invited awhole legion of cooks to assist him.  They won\'t serve for nothing, andthis is another item in the total of my day\'s expenses. By Bacchus!thrice lucky shall I be if the slaves do not help themselves to some ofthe drinking vessels: ready, alas, are their hands, capacious are theirtunics.  Me miserum!\'The cooks, however, worked on, seemingly heedless of the apparition ofDiomed.\'Ho, Euclio, your egg-pan!  What, is this the largest? it only holdsthirty-three eggs: in the houses I usually serve, the smallest egg-panholds fifty, if need be!\'\'The unconscionable rogue!\' thought Diomed; \'he talks of eggs as if theywere a sesterce a hundred!\'\'By Mercury!\' cried a pert little culinary disciple, scarce in hisnovitiate; \'whoever saw such antique sweetmeat shapes as these?--It isimpossible to do credit to one\'s art with such rude materials.  Why,Sallust\'s commonest sweetmeat shape represents the whole siege of Troy;Hector and Paris, and Helen...  with little Astyanax and the WoodenHorse into the bargain!\'\'Silence, fool!\' said Congrio, the cook of the house, who seemed toleave the chief part of the battle to his allies.  \'My master, Diomed,is not one of those expensive good-for-noughts, who must have the lastfashion, cost what it will!\'\'Thou liest, base slave!\' cried Diomed, in a great passion--and thoucostest me already enough to have ruined Lucullus himself!  Come out ofthy den, I want to talk to thee.\'The slave, with a sly wink at his confederates, obeyed the command.\'Man of three letters,\' said Diomed, with his face of solemn anger, \'howdidst thou dare to invite all those rascals into my house?--I see thiefwritten in every line of their faces.\'\'Yet, I assure you, master, that they are men of most respectablecharacter--the best cooks of the place; it is a great favor to get them.But for my sake...\'\'Thy sake, unhappy Congrio!\' interrupted Diomed; and by what purloinedmoneys of mine, by what reserved filchings from marketing, by whatgoodly meats converted into grease, and sold in the suburbs, by whatfalse charges for bronzes marred, and earthenware broken--hast thou beenenabled to make them serve thee for thy sake?\'\'Nay, master, do not impeach my honesty!  May the gods desert me if...\'\'Swear not!\' again interrupted the choleric Diomed, \'for then the godswill smite thee for a perjurer, and I shall lose my cook on the eve ofdinner. But, enough of this at present: keep a sharp eye on thyill-favored assistants, and tell me no tales to-morrow of vases broken,and cups miraculously vanished, or thy whole back shall be one pain.And hark thee! thou knowest thou hast made me pay for those Phrygianattagens enough, by Hercules, to have feasted a sober man for a yeartogether--see that they be not one iota over-roasted.  The last time, OCongrio, that I gave a banquet to my friends, when thy vanity did soboldly undertake the becoming appearance of a Melian crane--thou knowestit came up like a stone from AEtna--as if all the fires of Phlegethonhad been scorching out its juices. Be modest this time, Congrio--waryand modest.  Modesty is the nurse of great actions; and in all otherthings, as in this, if thou wilt not spare thy master\'s purse, at leastconsult thy master\'s glory.\'\'There shall not be such a coena seen at Pompeii since the days ofHercules.\'\'Softly, softly--thy cursed boasting again!  But I say, Congrio, yonhomunculus--yon pigmy assailant of my cranes--yon pert-tongued neophyteof the kitchen, was there aught but insolence on his tongue when hemaligned the comeliness of my sweetmeat shapes?  I would not be out ofthe fashion, Congrio.\'\'It is but the custom of us cooks,\' replied Congrio, gravely, toundervalue our tools, in order to increase the effect of our art. Thesweetmeat shape is a fair shape, and a lovely; but I would recommend mymaster, at the first occasion, to purchase some new ones of a...\'\'That will suffice,\' exclaimed Diomed, who seemed resolved never toallow his slave to finish his sentences.  \'Now, resume thycharge--shine----eclipse thyself.  Let men envy Diomed his cook--let theslaves of Pompeii style thee Congrio the great!  Go! yet stay--thou hastnot spent all the moneys I gave thee for the marketing?\'\'""All!"" alas! the nightingales\' tongues and the Roman tomacula, and theoysters from Britain, and sundry other things, too numerous now torecite, are yet left unpaid for.  But what matter? every one trusts theArchimagirus of Diomed the wealthy!\'\'Oh, unconscionable prodigal!--what waste!--what profusion!--I amruined! But go, hasten--inspect!--taste!--perform!--surpass thyself!Let the Roman senator not despise the poor Pompeian.  Away, slave--andremember, the Phrygian attagens.\'The chief disappeared within his natural domain, and Diomed rolled backhis portly presence to the more courtly chambers.  All was to hisliking--the flowers were fresh, the fountains played briskly, the mosaicpavements were as smooth as mirrors.\'Where is my daughter Julia?\' he asked.\'At the bath.\'\'Ah! that reminds me!--time wanes!--and I must bathe also.\'Our story returns to Apaecides.  On awaking that day from the broken andfeverish sleep which had followed his adoption of a faith so strikinglyand sternly at variance with that in which his youth had been nurtured,the young priest could scarcely imagine that he was not yet in a dream;he had crossed the fatal river--the past was henceforth to have nosympathy with the future; the two worlds were distinct andseparate--that which had been, from that which was to be. To what a boldand adventurous enterprise he had pledged his life!--to unveil themysteries in which he had participated--to desecrate the altars he hadserved--to denounce the goddess whose ministering robe he wore!  Slowlyhe became sensible of the hatred and the horror he should provokeamongst the pious, even if successful; if frustrated in his daringattempt, what penalties might he not incur for an offence hithertounheard of--for which no specific law, derived from experience, wasprepared; and which, for that very reason, precedents, dragged from thesharpest armoury of obsolete and inapplicable legislation, wouldprobably be distorted to meet!  His friends--the sister of hisyouth--could he expect justice, though he might receive compassion, fromthem? This brave and heroic act would by their heathen eyes be regarded,perhaps, as a heinous apostasy--at the best as a pitiable madness.He dared, he renounced, everything in this world, in the hope ofsecuring that eternity in the next, which had so suddenly been revealedto him. While these thoughts on the one hand invaded his breast, on theother hand his pride, his courage, and his virtue, mingled withreminiscences of revenge for deceit, of indignant disgust at fraud,conspired to raise and to support him.The conflict was sharp and keen; but his new feelings triumphed over hisold: and a mighty argument in favor of wrestling with the sanctities ofold opinions and hereditary forms might be found in the conquest overboth, achieved by that humble priest.  Had the early Christians beenmore controlled by \'the solemn plausibilities of custom\'--less ofdemocrats in the pure and lofty acceptation of that pervertedword--Christianity would have perished in its cradle!As each priest in succession slept several nights together in thechambers of the temple, the term imposed on Apaecides was not yetcompleted; and when he had risen from his couch, attired himself, asusual, in his robes, and left his narrow chamber, he found himselfbefore the altars of the temple.In the exhaustion of his late emotions he had slept far into themorning, and the vertical sun already poured its fervid beams over thesacred place.\'Salve, Apaecides!\' said a voice, whose natural asperity was smoothed bylong artifice into an almost displeasing softness of tone. \'Thou artlate abroad; has the goddess revealed herself to thee in visions?\'\'Could she reveal her true self to the people, Calenus, how incenselesswould be these altars!\'\'That,\' replied Calenus, \'may possibly be true; but the deity is wiseenough to hold commune with none but priests.\'\'A time may come when she will be unveiled without her ownacquiescence.\'\'It is not likely: she has triumphed for countless ages.  And that whichhas so long stood the test of time rarely succumbs to the lust ofnovelty.  But hark ye, young brother! these sayings are indiscreet.\'\'It is not for thee to silence them,\' replied Apaecides, haughtily.\'So hot!--yet I will not quarrel with thee.  Why, my Apaecides, has notthe Egyptian convinced thee of the necessity of our dwelling together inunity? Has he not convinced thee of the wisdom of deluding the peopleand enjoying ourselves?  If not, oh, brother! he is not that greatmagician he is esteemed.\'\'Thou, then, hast shared his lessons?\' said Apaecides, with a hollowsmile.\'Ay! but I stood less in need of them than thou.  Nature had alreadygifted me with the love of pleasure, and the desire of gain and power.Long is the way that leads the voluptuary to the severities of life; butit is only one step from pleasant sin to sheltering hypocrisy.  Bewarethe vengeance of the goddess, if the shortness of that step bedisclosed!\'\'Beware, thou, the hour when the tomb shall be rent and the rottennessexposed,\' returned Apaecides, solemnly.  \'Vale!\'With these words he left the flamen to his meditations.  When he got afew paces from the temple, he turned to look back.  Calenus had alreadydisappeared in the entry room of the priests, for it now approached thehour of that repast which, called prandium by the ancients, answers inpoint of date to the breakfast of the moderns. The white and gracefulfane gleamed brightly in the sun.  Upon the altars before it rose theincense and bloomed the garlands.  The priest gazed long and wistfullyupon the scene--it was the last time that it was ever beheld by him!He then turned and pursued his way slowly towards the house of Ione; forbefore possibly the last tie that united them was cut in twain--beforethe uncertain peril of the next day was incurred, he was anxious to seehis last surviving relative, his fondest as his earliest friend.He arrived at her house, and found her in the garden with Nydia.\'This is kind, Apaecides,\' said Ione, joyfully; \'and how eagerly have Iwished to see thee!--what thanks do I not owe thee?  How churlish hastthou been to answer none of my letters--to abstain from coming hither toreceive the expressions of my gratitude!  Oh! thou hast assisted topreserve thy sister from dishonour!  What, what can she say to thankthee, now thou art come at last?\'\'My sweet Ione, thou owest me no gratitude, for thy cause was mine.  Letus avoid that subject, let us recur not to that impious man--how hatefulto both of us!  I may have a speedy opportunity to teach the world thenature of his pretended wisdom and hypocritical severity.  But let ussit down, my sister; I am wearied with the heat of the sun; let us sitin yonder shade, and, for a little while longer, be to each other whatwe have been.\'Beneath a wide plane-tree, with the cistus and the arbutus clusteringround them, the living fountain before, the greensward beneath theirfeet; the gay cicada, once so dear to Athens, rising merrily ever andanon amidst the grass; the butterfly, beautiful emblem of the soul,dedicated to Psyche, and which has continued to furnish illustrations tothe Christian bard, rich in the glowing colors caught from Sicilianskies, hovering about the sunny flowers, itself like a winged flower--inthis spot, and this scene, the brother and the sister sat together forthe last time on earth. You may tread now on the same place; but thegarden is no more, the columns are shattered, the fountain has ceased toplay.  Let the traveler search amongst the ruins of Pompeii for thehouse of Ione. Its remains are yet visible; but I will not betray themto the gaze of commonplace tourists.  He who is more sensitive than theherd will discover them easily: when he has done so, let him keep thesecret.They sat down, and Nydia, glad to be alone, retired to the farther endof the garden.\'Ione, my sister,\' said the young convert, \'place your hand upon mybrow; let me feel your cool touch.  Speak to me, too, for your gentlevoice is like a breeze that hath freshness as well as music. Speak tome, but forbear to bless me!  Utter not one word of those forms ofspeech which our childhood was taught to consider sacred!\'\'Alas! and what then shall I say?  Our language of affection is so wovenwith that of worship, that the words grow chilled and trite if I banishfrom them allusion to our gods.\'\'Our gods!\' murmured Apaecides, with a shudder: \'thou slightest myrequest already.\'\'Shall I speak then to thee only of Isis?\'\'The Evil Spirit!  No, rather be dumb for ever, unless at least thoucanst--but away, away this talk!  Not now will we dispute and cavil; notnow will we judge harshly of each other.  Thou, regarding me as anapostate! and I all sorrow and shame for thee as an idolater. No, mysister, let us avoid such topics and such thoughts.  In thy sweetpresence a calm falls over my spirit.  For a little while I forget.  AsI thus lay my temples on thy bosom, as I thus feel thy gentle armembrace me, I think that we are children once more, and that the heavensmiles equally upon both.  For oh! if hereafter I escape, no matter whatperil; and it be permitted me to address thee on one sacred and awfulsubject; should I find thine ear closed and thy heart hardened, whathope for myself could countervail the despair for thee?  In thee, mysister, I behold a likeness made beautiful, made noble, of myself.Shall the mirror live for ever, and the form itself be broken as thepotter\'s clay?  Ah, no--no--thou wilt listen to me yet!  Dost thouremember how we went into the fields by Baiae, hand in hand together, topluck the flowers of spring?  Even so, hand in hand, shall we enter theEternal Garden, and crown ourselves with imperishable asphodel!\'Wondering and bewildered by words she could not comprehend, but excitedeven to tears by the plaintiveness of their tone, Ione listened to theseoutpourings of a full and oppressed heart.  In truth, Apaecides himselfwas softened much beyond his ordinary mood, which to outward seeming wasusually either sullen or impetuous.  For the noblest desires are of ajealous nature--they engross, they absorb the soul, and often leave thesplenetic humors stagnant and unheeded at the surface.  Unheeding thepetty things around us, we are deemed morose; impatient at earthlyinterruption to the diviner dreams, we are thought irritable andchurlish.  For as there is no chimera vainer than the hope that onehuman heart shall find sympathy in another, so none ever interpret uswith justice; and none, no, not our nearest and our dearest ties,forbear with us in mercy!  When we are dead and repentance comes toolate, both friend and foe may wonder to think how little there was in usto forgive!\'I will talk to thee then of our early years,\' said Ione.  \'Shall yonblind girl sing to thee of the days of childhood?  Her voice is sweetand musical, and she hath a song on that theme which contains none ofthose allusions it pains thee to hear.\'\'Dost thou remember the words, my sister?\' asked Apaecides.\'Methinks yes; for the tune, which is simple, fixed them on my memory.\'\'Sing to me then thyself.  My ear is not in unison with unfamiliarvoices; and thine, Ione, full of household associations, has ever beento me more sweet than all the hireling melodies of Lycia or of Crete.Sing to me!\'Ione beckoned to a slave that stood in the portico, and sending for herlute, sang, when it arrived, to a tender and simple air, the followingverses:--              REGRETS FOR CHILDHOOD                    I         It is not that our earlier Heaven              Escapes its April showers,          Or that to childhood\'s heart is given              No snake amidst the flowers.                 Ah! twined with grief                 Each brightest leaf,              That\'s wreath\'d us by the Hours!          Young though we be, the Past may sting,              The present feed its sorrow;          But hope shines bright on every thing              That waits us with the morrow.                 Like sun-lit glades,                 The dimmest shades              Some rosy beam can borrow.                    II         It is not that our later years              Of cares are woven wholly,          But smiles less swiftly chase the tears,              And wounds are healed more slowly.                 And Memory\'s vow                 To lost ones now,              Makes joys too bright, unholy.          And ever fled the Iris bow              That smiled when clouds were o\'er us.          If storms should burst, uncheered we go,              A drearier waste before us--                And with the toys                 Of childish joys,              We\'ve broke the staff that bore us!Wisely and delicately had Ione chosen that song, sad though its burthenseemed; for when we are deeply mournful, discordant above all others isthe voice of mirth: the fittest spell is that borrowed from melancholyitself, for dark thoughts can be softened down when they cannot bebrightened; and so they lose the precise and rigid outline of theirtruth, and their colors melt into the ideal.  As the leech applies inremedy to the internal sore some outward irritation, which, by a gentlerwound, draws away the venom of that which is more deadly, thus, in therankling festers of the mind, our art is to divert to a milder sadnesson the surface the pain that gnaweth at the core.  And so withApaecides, yielding to the influence of the silver voice that remindedhim of the past, and told but of half the sorrow born to the present, heforgot his more immediate and fiery sources of anxious thought.  Hespent hours in making Ione alternately sing to, and converse with him;and when he rose to leave her, it was with a calmed and lulled mind.\'Ione,\' said he, as he pressed her hand, \'should you hear my nameblackened and maligned, will you credit the aspersion?\'\'Never, my brother, never!\'\'Dost thou not imagine, according to thy belief, that the evil-doer ispunished hereafter, and the good rewarded?\'\'Can you doubt it?\'\'Dost thou think, then, that he who is truly good should sacrifice everyselfish interest in his zeal for virtue?\'\'He who doth so is the equal of the gods.\'\'And thou believest that, according to the purity and courage with whichhe thus acts, shall be his portion of bliss beyond the grave?\'\'So we are taught to hope.\'\'Kiss me, my sister.  One question more.  Thou art to be wedded toGlaucus: perchance that marriage may separate us more hopelessly--butnot of this speak I now--thou art to be married to Glaucus--dost thoulove him?  Nay, my sister, answer me by words.\'\'Yes!\' murmured Ione, blushing.\'Dost thou feel that, for his sake, thou couldst renounce pride, bravedishonour, and incur death?  I have heard that when women really love,it is to that excess.\'\'My brother, all this could I do for Glaucus, and feel that it were nota sacrifice.  There is no sacrifice to those who love, in what is bornefor the one we love.\'\'Enough! shall woman feel thus for man, and man feel less devotion tohis God?\'He spoke no more.  His whole countenance seemed instinct and inspiredwith a divine life: his chest swelled proudly; his eyes glowed: on hisforehead was writ the majesty of a man who can dare to be noble!  Heturned to meet the eyes of Ione--earnest, wistful, fearful--he kissedher fondly, strained her warmly to his breast, and in a moment more hehad left the house.Long did Ione remain in the same place, mute and thoughtful.  Themaidens again and again came to warn her of the deepening noon, and herengagement to Diomed\'s banquet.  At length she woke from her reverie,and prepared, not with the pride of beauty, but listless and melancholy,for the festival: one thought alone reconciled her to the promisedvisit--she should meet Glaucus--she could confide to him her alarm anduneasiness for her brother.Chapter IIIA FASHIONABLE PARTY AND A DINNER A LA MODE IN POMPEII.MEANWHILE Sallust and Glaucus were slowly strolling towards the house ofDiomed.  Despite the habits of his life, Sallust was not devoid of manyestimable qualities.  He would have been an active friend, a usefulcitizen--in short, an excellent man, if he had not taken it into hishead to be a philosopher.  Brought up in the schools in which Romanplagiarism worshipped the echo of Grecian wisdom, he had imbued himselfwith those doctrines by which the later Epicureans corrupted the simplemaxims of their great master.  He gave himself altogether up topleasure, and imagined there was no sage like a boon companion.  Still,however, he had a considerable degree of learning, wit, and good nature;and the hearty frankness of his very vices seemed like virtue itselfbeside the utter corruption of Clodius and the prostrate effeminacy ofLepidus; and therefore Glaucus liked him the best of his companions; andhe, in turn, appreciating the nobler qualities of the Athenian, lovedhim almost as much as a cold muraena, or a bowl of the best Falernian.\'This is a vulgar old fellow, this Diomed,\' said Sallust: \'but he hassome good qualities--in his cellar!\'\'And some charming ones--in his daughter.\'\'True, Glaucus: but you are not much moved by them, methinks.  I fancyClodius is desirous to be your successor.\'\'He is welcome.  At the banquet of Julia\'s beauty, no guest, be sure, isconsidered a musca.\'\'You are severe: but she has, indeed, something of the Corinthian abouther--they will be well matched, after all!  What good-natured fellows weare to associate with that gambling good-for-nought.\'\'Pleasure unites strange varieties,\' answered Glaucus.  \'He amusesme...\'\'And flatters--but then he pays himself well!  He powders his praisewith gold-dust.\'\'You often hint that he plays unfairly--think you so really?\'\'My dear Glaucus, a Roman noble has his dignity to keep up--dignity isvery expensive--Clodius must cheat like a scoundrel, in order to livelike a gentleman.\'\'Ha ha!--well, of late I have renounced the dice.  Ah! Sallust, when Iam wedded to Ione, I trust I may yet redeem a youth of follies. We areboth born for better things than those in which we sympathize now--bornto render our worship in nobler temples than the stye of Epicurus.\'\'Alas!\' returned Sallust, in rather a melancholy tone, \'what do we knowmore than this--life is short--beyond the grave all is dark? There is nowisdom like that which says ""enjoy"".\'\'By Bacchus!  I doubt sometimes if we do enjoy the utmost of which lifeis capable.\'\'I am a moderate man,\' returned Sallust, \'and do not ask ""the utmost"".We are like malefactors, and intoxicate ourselves with wine and myrrh,as we stand on the brink of death; but, if we did not do so, the abysswould look very disagreeable.  I own that I was inclined to be gloomyuntil I took so heartily to drinking--that is a new life, my Glaucus.\'\'Yes! but it brings us next morning to a new death.\'\'Why, the next morning is unpleasant, I own; but, then, if it were notso, one would never be inclined to read.  I study betimes--because, bythe gods! I am generally unfit for anything else till noon.\'\'Fie, Scythian!\'\'Pshaw! the fate of Pentheus to him who denies Bacchus.\'\'Well, Sallust, with all your faults, you are the best profligate I evermet: and verily, if I were in danger of life, you are the only man inall Italy who would stretch out a finger to save me.\'\'Perhaps I should not, if it were in the middle of supper.  But, intruth, we Italians are fearfully selfish.\'\'So are all men who are not free,\' said Glaucus, with a sigh. \'Freedomalone makes men sacrifice to each other.\'\'Freedom, then, must be a very fatiguing thing to an Epicurean,\'answered Sallust.  \'But here we are at our host\'s.\'As Diomed\'s villa is one of the most considerable in point of size ofany yet discovered at Pompeii, and is, moreover, built much according tothe specific instructions for a suburban villa laid down by the Romanarchitect, it may not be uninteresting briefly to describe the plan ofthe apartments through which our visitors passed.They entered, then, by the same small vestibule at which we have beforebeen presented to the aged Medon, and passed at once into a colonnade,technically termed the peristyle; for the main difference between thesuburban villa and the town mansion consisted in placing, in the first,the said colonnade in exactly the same place as that which in the townmansion was occupied by the atrium.  In the centre of the peristyle wasan open court, which contained the impluvium.From this peristyle descended a staircase to the offices; another narrowpassage on the opposite side communicated with a garden; various smallapartments surrounded the colonnade, appropriated probably to countryvisitors.  Another door to the left on entering communicated with asmall triangular portico, which belonged to the baths; and behind wasthe wardrobe, in which were kept the vests of the holiday suits of theslaves, and, perhaps, of the master.  Seventeen centuries afterwardswere found those relics of ancient finery calcined and crumbling: keptlonger, alas! than their thrifty lord foresaw.Return we to the peristyle, and endeavor now to present to the reader acoup d\'oeil of the whole suite of apartments, which immediatelystretched before the steps of the visitors.Let him then first imagine the columns of the portico, hung withfestoons of flowers; the columns themselves in the lower part paintedred, and the walls around glowing with various frescoes; then, lookingbeyond a curtain, three parts drawn aside, the eye caught the tablinumor saloon (which was closed at will by glazed doors, now slid back intothe walls).  On either side of this tablinum were small rooms, one ofwhich was a kind of cabinet of gems; and these apartments, as well asthe tablinum, communicated with a long gallery, which opened at eitherend upon terraces; and between the terraces, and communicating with thecentral part of the gallery, was a hall, in which the banquet was thatday prepared.  All these apartments, though almost on a level with thestreet, were one story above the garden; and the terraces communicatingwith the gallery were continued into corridors, raised above the pillarswhich, to the right and left, skirted the garden below.Beneath, and on a level with the garden, ran the apartments we havealready described as chiefly appropriated to Julia.In the gallery, then, just mentioned, Diomed received his guests.The merchant affected greatly the man of letters, and, therefore, healso affected a passion for everything Greek; he paid particularattention to Glaucus.\'You will see, my friend,\' said he, with a wave of his hand, \'that I ama little classical here--a little Cecropian--eh?  The hall in which weshall sup is borrowed from the Greeks.  It is an OEcus Cyzicene.  NobleSallust, they have not, I am told, this sort of apartment in Rome.\'\'Oh!\' replied Sallust, with a half smile; \'you Pompeians combine allthat is most eligible in Greece and in Rome; may you, Diomed, combinethe viands as well as the architecture!\'\'You shall see--you shall see, my Sallust,\' replied the merchant.  \'Wehave a taste at Pompeii, and we have also money.\'\'They are two excellent things,\' replied Sallust.  \'But, behold, thelady Julia!\'The main difference, as I have before remarked, in the manner of lifeobserved among the Athenians and Romans, was, that with the first, themodest women rarely or never took part in entertainments; with thelatter, they were the common ornaments of the banquet; but when theywere present at the feast, it usually terminated at an early hour.Magnificently robed in white, interwoven with pearls and threads ofgold, the handsome Julia entered the apartment.Scarcely had she received the salutation of the two guests, ere Pansaand his wife, Lepidus, Clodius, and the Roman senator, entered almostsimultaneously; then came the widow Fulvia; then the poet Fulvius, liketo the widow in name if in nothing else; the warrior from Herculaneum,accompanied by his umbra, next stalked in; afterwards, the less eminentof the guests.  Ione yet tarried.It was the mode among the courteous ancients to flatter whenever it wasin their power: accordingly it was a sign of ill-breeding to seatthemselves immediately on entering the house of their host.  Afterperforming the salutation, which was usually accomplished by the samecordial shake of the right hand which we ourselves retain, andsometimes, by the yet more familiar embrace, they spent several minutesin surveying the apartment, and admiring the bronzes, the pictures, orthe furniture, with which it was adorned--a mode very impolite accordingto our refined English notions, which place good breeding inindifference.  We would not for the world express much admiration ofanother man\'s house, for fear it should be thought we had never seenanything so fine before!\'A beautiful statue this of Bacchus!\' said the Roman senator.\'A mere trifle!\' replied Diomed.\'What charming paintings!\' said Fulvia.\'Mere trifles!\' answered the owner.\'Exquisite candelabra!\' cried the warrior.\'Exquisite!\' echoed his umbra.\'Trifles! trifles!\' reiterated the merchant.Meanwhile, Glaucus found himself by one of the windows of the gallery,which communicated with the terraces, and the fair Julia by his side.\'Is it an Athenian virtue, Glaucus,\' said the merchant\'s daughter, \'toshun those whom we once sought?\'\'Fair Julia--no!\'\'Yet methinks, it is one of the qualities of Glaucus.\'\'Glaucus never shuns a friend!\' replied the Greek, with some emphasis onthe last word.\'May Julia rank among the number of his friends?\'\'It would be an honour to the emperor to find a friend in one solovely.\'\'You evade my question,\' returned the enamoured Julia.  \'But tell me, isit true that you admire the Neapolitan Ione?\'\'Does not beauty constrain our admiration?\'\'Ah! subtle Greek, still do you fly the meaning of my words.  But say,shall Julia be indeed your friend?\'\'If she will so favor me, blessed be the gods!  The day in which I amthus honored shall be ever marked in white.\'\'Yet, even while you speak, your eye is resting--your color comes andgoes--you move away involuntarily--you are impatient to join Ione!\'For at that moment Ione had entered, and Glaucus had indeed betrayed theemotion noticed by the jealous beauty.\'Can admiration to one woman make me unworthy the friendship of another?Sanction not so, O Julia the libels of the poets on your sex!\'\'Well, you are right--or I will learn to think so.  Glaucus, yet onemoment! You are to wed Ione; is it not so?\'\'If the Fates permit, such is my blessed hope.\'\'Accept, then, from me, in token of our new friendship, a present foryour bride.  Nay, it is the custom of friends, you know, always topresent to bride and bridegroom some such little marks of their esteemand favoring wishes.\'\'Julia! I cannot refuse any token of friendship from one like you. Iwill accept the gift as an omen from Fortune herself.\'\'Then, after the feast, when the guests retire, you will descend with meto my apartment, and receive it from my hands.  Remember!\' said Julia,as she joined the wife of Pansa, and left Glaucus to seek Ione.The widow Fulvia and the spouse of the aedile were engaged in high andgrave discussion.\'O Fulvia! I assure you that the last account from Rome declares thatthe frizzling mode of dressing the hair is growing antiquated; they onlynow wear it built up in a tower, like Julia\'s, or arranged as ahelmet--the Galerian fashion, like mine, you see: it has a fine effect,I think. I assure you, Vespius (Vespius was the name of the Herculaneumhero) admires it greatly.\'\'And nobody wears the hair like yon Neapolitan, in the Greek way.\'\'What, parted in front, with the knot behind?  Oh, no; how ridiculous itis! it reminds one of the statue of Diana!  Yet this Ione is handsome,eh?\'\'So the men say; but then she is rich: she is to marry the Athenian--Iwish her joy.  He will not be long faithful, I suspect; those foreignersare very faithless.\'\'Oh, Julia!\' said Fulvia, as the merchant\'s daughter joined them; \'haveyou seen the tiger yet?\'\'No!\'\'Why, all the ladies have been to see him.  He is so handsome!\'\'I hope we shall find some criminal or other for him and the lion,\'replied Julia.  \'Your husband (turning to Pansa\'s wife) is not so activeas he should be in this matter.\'\'Why, really, the laws are too mild,\' replied the dame of the helmet.\'There are so few offences to which the punishment of the arena can beawarded; and then, too, the gladiators are growing effeminate!  Thestoutest bestiarii declare they are willing enough to fight a boar or abull; but as for a lion or a tiger, they think the game too much inearnest.\'\'They are worthy of a mitre,\' replied Julia, in disdain.\'Oh! have you seen the new house of Fulvius, the dear poet?\' saidPansa\'s wife.\'No: is it handsome?\'\'Very!--such good taste.  But they say, my dear, that he has suchimproper pictures!  He won\'t show them to the women: how ill-bred!\'\'Those poets are always odd,\' said the widow.  \'But he is an interestingman; what pretty verses he writes!  We improve very much in poetry: itis impossible to read the old stuff now.\'\'I declare I am of your opinion, returned the lady of the helmet.\'There is so much more force and energy in the modern school.\'The warrior sauntered up to the ladies.\'It reconciles me to peace,\' said he, \'when I see such faces.\'\'Oh!  you heroes are ever flatterers,\' returned Fulvia, hastening toappropriate the compliment specially to herself.\'By this chain, which I received from the emperor\'s own hand,\' repliedthe warrior, playing with a short chain which hung round the neck like acollar, instead of descending to the breast, according to the fashion ofthe peaceful--\'By this chain, you wrong me!  I am a blunt man--a soldiershould be so.\'\'How do you find the ladies of Pompeii generally?\' said Julia.\'By Venus, most beautiful!  They favor me a little, it is true, and thatinclines my eyes to double their charms.\'\'We love a warrior,\' said the wife of Pansa.\'I see it: by Hercules! it is even disagreeable to be too celebrated inthese cities.  At Herculaneum they climb the roof of my atrium to catcha glimpse of me through the compluvium; the admiration of one\'s citizensis pleasant at first, but burthensome afterwards.\'\'True, true, O Vespius!\' cried the poet, joining the group: \'I find itso myself.\'\'You!\' said the stately warrior, scanning the small form of the poetwith ineffable disdain.  \'In what legion have you served?\'\'You may see my spoils, my exuviae, in the forum itself,\' returned thepoet, with a significant glance at the women.  \'I have been among thetent-companions, the contubernales, of the great Mantuan himself.\'\'I know no general from Mantua, said the warrior, gravely.  \'Whatcampaign have you served?\'\'That of Helicon.\'\'I never heard of it.\'\'Nay, Vespius, he does but joke,\' said Julia, laughing.\'Joke!  By Mars, am I a man to be joked!\'\'Yes; Mars himself was in love with the mother of jokes,\' said the poet,a little alarmed.  \'Know, then, O Vespius! that I am the poet Fulvius.It is I who make warriors immortal!\'\'The gods forbid!\' whispered Sallust to Julia.  \'If Vespius were madeimmortal, what a specimen of tiresome braggadocio would be transmittedto posterity!\'The soldier looked puzzled; when, to the infinite relief of himself andhis companions, the signal for the feast was given.As we have already witnessed at the house of Glaucus the ordinaryroutine of a Pompeian entertainment, the reader is spared any seconddetail of the courses, and the manner in which they were introduced.Diomed, who was rather ceremonious, had appointed a nomenclator, orappointer of places to each guest.The reader understands that the festive board was composed of threetables; one at the centre, and one at each wing.  It was only at theouter side of these tables that the guests reclined; the inner space wasleft untenanted, for the greater convenience of the waiters or ministri.The extreme corner of one of the wings was appropriated to Julia as thelady of the feast; that next her, to Diomed.  At one corner of thecentre table was placed the aedile; at the opposite corner, the Romansenator--these were the posts of honour.  The other guests werearranged, so that the young (gentleman or lady) should sit next eachother, and the more advanced in years be similarly matched.  Anagreeable provision enough, but one which must often have offended thosewho wished to be thought still young.The chair of Ione was next to the couch of Glaucus.  The seats wereveneered with tortoiseshell, and covered with quilts stuffed withfeathers, and ornamented with costly embroideries.  The modern ornamentsof epergne or plateau were supplied by images of the gods, wrought inbronze, ivory, and silver.  The sacred salt-cellar and the familiarLares were not forgotten. Over the table and the seats a rich canopy wassuspended from the ceiling. At each corner of the table were loftycandelabra--for though it was early noon, the room was darkened--whilefrom tripods, placed in different parts of the room, distilled the odorof myrrh and frankincense; and upon the abacus, or sideboard, largevases and various ornaments of silver were ranged, much with the sameostentation (but with more than the same taste) that we find displayedat a modern feast.The custom of grace was invariably supplied by that of libations to thegods; and Vesta, as queen of the household gods, usually received firstthat graceful homage.This ceremony being performed, the slaves showered flowers upon thecouches and the floor, and crowned each guest with rosy garlands,intricately woven with ribands, tied by the rind of the linden-tree, andeach intermingled with the ivy and the amethyst--supposed preventivesagainst the effect of wine; the wreaths of the women only were exemptedfrom these leaves, for it was not the fashion for them to drink wine inpublic.  It was then that the president Diomed thought it advisable toinstitute a basileus, or director of the feast--an important office,sometimes chosen by lot; sometimes, as now, by the master of theentertainment.Diomed was not a little puzzled as to his election.  The invalid senatorwas too grave and too infirm for the proper fulfilment of his duty; theaedile Pansa was adequate enough to the task: but then, to choose thenext in official rank to the senator, was an affront to the senatorhimself.  While deliberating between the merits of the others, he caughtthe mirthful glance of Sallust, and, by a sudden inspiration, named thejovial epicure to the rank of director, or arbiter bibendi.Sallust received the appointment with becoming humility.\'I shall be a merciful king,\' said he, \'to those who drink deep; to arecusant, Minos himself shall be less inexorable.  Beware!\'The slaves handed round basins of perfumed water, by which lavation thefeast commenced: and now the table groaned under the initiatory course.The conversation, at first desultory and scattered, allowed Ione andGlaucus to carry on those sweet whispers, which are worth all theeloquence in the world.  Julia watched them with flashing eyes.\'How soon shall her place be mine!\' thought she.But Clodius, who sat in the centre table, so as to observe well thecountenance of Julia, guessed her pique, and resolved to profit by it.He addressed her across the table in set phrases of gallantry; and as hewas of high birth and of a showy person, the vain Julia was not so muchin love as to be insensible to his attentions.The slaves, in the interim, were constantly kept upon the alert by thevigilant Sallust, who chased one cup by another with a celerity whichseemed as if he were resolved upon exhausting those capacious cellarswhich the reader may yet see beneath the house of Diomed. The worthymerchant began to repent his choice, as amphora after amphora waspierced and emptied.  The slaves, all under the age of manhood (theyoungest being about ten years old--it was they who filled the wine--theeldest, some five years older, mingled it with water), seemed to sharein the zeal of Sallust; and the face of Diomed began to glow as hewatched the provoking complacency with which they seconded the exertionsof the king of the feast.\'Pardon me, O senator!\' said Sallust; \'I see you flinch; your purple hemcannot save you--drink!\'\'By the gods,\' said the senator, coughing, \'my lungs are already onfire; you proceed with so miraculous a swiftness, that Phaeton himselfwas nothing to you.  I am infirm, O pleasant Sallust: you must exonerateme.\'\'Not I, by Vesta!  I am an impartial monarch--drink.\'The poor senator, compelled by the laws of the table, was forced tocomply. Alas! every cup was bringing him nearer and nearer to theStygian pool.\'Gently! gently! my king,\' groaned Diomed; \'we already begin to...\'\'Treason!\' interrupted Sallust; \'no stern Brutus here!--no interferencewith royalty!\'\'But our female guests...\'\'Love a toper!  Did not Ariadne dote upon Bacchus?\'The feast proceeded; the guests grew more talkative and noisy; thedessert or last course was already on the table; and the slaves boreround water with myrrh and hyssop for the finishing lavation.  At thesame time, a small circular table that had been placed in the spaceopposite the guests suddenly, and as by magic, seemed to open in thecentre, and cast up a fragrant shower, sprinkling the table and theguests; while as it ceased the awning above them was drawn aside, andthe guests perceived that a rope had been stretched across the ceiling,and that one of those nimble dancers for which Pompeii was socelebrated, and whose descendants add so charming a grace to thefestivities of Astley\'s or Vauxhall, was now treading his airy measuresright over their heads.This apparition, removed but by a cord from one\'s pericranium, andindulging the most vehement leaps, apparently with the intention ofalighting upon that cerebral region, would probably be regarded withsome terror by a party in May Fair; but our Pompeian revellers seemed tobehold the spectacle with delighted curiosity, and applauded inproportion as the dancer appeared with the most difficulty to missfalling upon the head of whatever guest he particularly selected todance above.  He paid the senator, indeed, the peculiar compliment ofliterally falling from the rope, and catching it again with his hand,just as the whole party imagined the skull of the Roman was as muchfractured as ever that of the poet whom the eagle took for a tortoise.At length, to the great relief of at least Ione, who had not muchaccustomed herself to this entertainment, the dancer suddenly paused asa strain of music was heard from without.  He danced again still morewildly; the air changed, the dancer paused again; no, it could notdissolve the charm which was supposed to possess him!  He representedone who by a strange disorder is compelled to dance, and whom only acertain air of music can cure.  At length the musician seemed to hit onthe right tune; the dancer gave one leap, swung himself down from therope, alighted on the floor, and vanished.One art now yielded to another; and the musicians who were stationedwithout on the terrace struck up a soft and mellow air, to which weresung the following words, made almost indistinct by the barrier betweenand the exceeding lowness of the minstrelsy:--             FESTIVE MUSIC SHOULD BE LOW                      I     Hark! through these flowers our music sends its greeting        To your loved halls, where Psilas shuns the day;      When the young god his Cretan nymph was meeting        He taught Pan\'s rustic pipe this gliding lay:           Soft as the dews of wine             Shed in this banquet hour,           The rich libation of Sound\'s stream divine,             O reverent harp, to Aphrodite pour!                     II     Wild rings the trump o\'er ranks to glory marching;        Music\'s sublimer bursts for war are meet;      But sweet lips murmuring under wreaths o\'er-arching,        Find the low whispers like their own most sweet.           Steal, my lull\'d music, steal             Like womans\'s half-heard tone,           So that whoe\'er shall hear, shall think to feel             In thee the voice of lips that love his own.At the end of that song Ione\'s cheek blushed more deeply than before,and Glaucus had contrived, under cover of the table, to steal her hand.\'It is a pretty song,\' said Fulvius, patronizingly.\'Ah! if you would oblige us!\' murmured the wife of Pansa.\'Do you wish Fulvius to sing?\' asked the king of the feast, who had justcalled on the assembly to drink the health of the Roman senator, a cupto each letter of his name.\'Can you ask?\' said the matron, with a complimentary glance at the poet.Sallust snapped his fingers, and whispering the slave who came to learnhis orders, the latter disappeared, and returned in a few moments with asmall harp in one hand, and a branch of myrtle in the other.  The slaveapproached the poet, and with a low reverence presented to him the harp.\'Alas! I cannot play,\' said the poet.\'Then you must sing to the myrtle.  It is a Greek fashion: Diomed lovesthe Greeks--I love the Greeks--you love the Greeks--we all love theGreeks--and between you and me this is not the only thing we have stolenfrom them. However, I introduce this custom--I, the king: sing, subject,sing!\' The poet, with a bashful smile, took the myrtle in his hands, andafter a short prelude sang as follows, in a pleasant and well-tunedvoice:--           THE CORONATION OF THE LOVES                    I           The merry Loves one holiday              Were all at gambols madly;            But Loves too long can seldom play              Without behaving sadly.           They laugh\'d, they toy\'d, they romp\'d about,           And then for change they all fell out.           Fie, fie! how can they quarrel so?              My Lesbia--ah, for shame, love           Methinks \'tis scarce an hour ago              When we did just the same, love.                    II        The Loves, \'tis thought, were free till then,           They had no king or laws, dear;         But gods, like men, should subject be,           Say all the ancient saws, dear.         And so our crew resolved, for quiet,         To choose a king to curb their riot.             A kiss: ah! what a grievous thing              For both, methinks, \'twould be, child,             If I should take some prudish king,              And cease to be so free, child!                    III        Among their toys a Casque they found,           It was the helm of Ares;         With horrent plumes the crest was crown\'d,           It frightened all the Lares.         So fine a king was never known--        They placed the helmet on the throne.         My girl, since Valor wins the world,           They chose a mighty master;         But thy sweet flag of smiles unfurled           Would win the world much faster!                    IV      The Casque soon found the Loves too wild         A troop for him to school them;       For warriors know how one such child         Has aye contrived to fool them.       They plagued him so, that in despair       He took a wife the plague to share.           If kings themselves thus find the strife              Of earth, unshared, severe, girl;           Why just to halve the ills of life,              Come, take your partner here, girl.                    V       Within that room the Bird of Love          The whole affair had eyed then;        The monarch hail\'d the royal dove,          And placed her by his side then:        What mirth amidst the Loves was seen!        \'Long live,\' they cried, \'our King and Queen.\'            Ah! Lesbia, would that thrones were mine,              And crowns to deck that brow, love!            And yet I know that heart of thine              For me is throne enow, love!                    VI       The urchins hoped to tease the mate          As they had teased the hero;        But when the Dove in judgment sate          They found her worse than Nero!        Each look a frown, each word a law;        The little subjects shook with awe.        In thee I find the same deceit--         Too late, alas! a learner!        For where a mien more gently sweet?          And where a tyrant sterner?This song, which greatly suited the gay and lively fancy of thePompeians, was received with considerable applause, and the widowinsisted on crowning her namesake with the very branch of myrtle towhich he had sung.  It was easily twisted into a garland, and theimmortal Fulvius was crowned amidst the clapping of hands and shouts ofIo triumphe!  The song and the harp now circulated round the party, anew myrtle branch being handed about, stopping at each person who couldbe prevailed upon to sing.The sun began now to decline, though the revellers, who had worn awayseveral hours, perceived it not in their darkened chamber; and thesenator, who was tired, and the warrior, who had to return toHerculaneum, rising to depart, gave the signal for the generaldispersion.  \'Tarry yet a moment, my friends,\' said Diomed; \'if you willgo so soon, you must at least take a share in our concluding game.\'So saying, he motioned to one of the ministri, and whispering him, theslave went out, and presently returned with a small bowl containingvarious tablets carefully sealed, and, apparently, exactly similar.Each guest was to purchase one of these at the nominal price of thelowest piece of silver: and the sport of this lottery (which was thefavorite diversion of Augustus, who introduced it) consisted in theinequality, and sometimes the incongruity, of the prizes, the nature andamount of which were specified within the tablets.  For instance, thepoet, with a wry face, drew one of his own poems (no physician ever lesswillingly swallowed his own draught); the warrior drew a case ofbodkins, which gave rise to certain novel witticisms relative toHercules and the distaff; the widow Fulvia obtained a largedrinking-cup; Julia, a gentleman\'s buckle; and Lepidus, a lady\'spatch-box.  The most appropriate lot was drawn by the gambler Clodius,who reddened with anger on being presented to a set of cogged dice.  Acertain damp was thrown upon the gaiety which these various lots createdby an accident that was considered ominous; Glaucus drew the mostvaluable of all the prizes, a small marble statue of Fortune, of Grecianworkmanship: on handing it to him the slave suffered it to drop, and itbroke in pieces.A shiver went round the assembly, and each voice cried spontaneously onthe gods to avert the omen.Glaucus alone, though perhaps as superstitious as the rest, affected tobe unmoved.\'Sweet Neapolitan,\' whispered he tenderly to Ione, who had turned paleas the broken marble itself, \'I accept the omen.  It signifies that inobtaining thee, Fortune can give no more--she breaks her image when sheblesses me with thine.\'In order to divert the impression which this incident had occasioned inan assembly which, considering the civilization of the guests, wouldseem miraculously superstitious, if at the present day in a countryparty we did not often see a lady grow hypochondriacal on leaving a roomlast of thirteen, Sallust now crowning his cup with flowers, gave thehealth of their host.  This was followed by a similar compliment to theemperor; and then, with a parting cup to Mercury to send them pleasantslumbers, they concluded the entertainment by a last libation, and brokeup the party. Carriages and litters were little used in Pompeii, partlyowing to the extreme narrowness of the streets, partly to the convenientsmallness of the city.  Most of the guests replacing their sandals,which they had put off in the banquet-room, and induing their cloaks,left the house on foot attended by their slaves.Meanwhile, having seen Ione depart, Glaucus turning to the staircasewhich led down to the rooms of Julia, was conducted by a slave to anapartment in which he found the merchant\'s daughter already seated.\'Glaucus!\' said she, looking down, \'I see that you really love Ione--sheis indeed beautiful.\'\'Julia is charming enough to be generous,\' replied the Greek. \'Yes, Ilove Ione; amidst all the youth who court you, may you have oneworshipper as sincere.\'\'I pray the gods to grant it!  See, Glaucus, these pearls are thepresent I destine to your bride: may Juno give her health to wear them!\'So saying, she placed a case in his hand, containing a row of pearls ofsome size and price.  It was so much the custom for persons about to bemarried to receive these gifts, that Glaucus could have little scruplein accepting the necklace, though the gallant and proud Athenian inlyresolved to requite the gift by one of thrice its value. Julia thenstopping short his thanks, poured forth some wine into a small bowl.\'You have drunk many toasts with my father,\' said she smiling--\'one nowwith me.  Health and fortune to your bride!\'She touched the cup with her lips and then presented it to Glaucus.  Thecustomary etiquette required that Glaucus should drain the wholecontents; he accordingly did so.  Julia, unknowing the deceit whichNydia had practised upon her, watched him with sparkling eyes; althoughthe witch had told her that the effect might not be immediate, she yetsanguinely trusted to an expeditious operation in favor of her charms.She was disappointed when she found Glaucus coldly replace the cup, andconverse with her in the same unmoved but gentle tone as before.  Andthough she detained him as long as she decorously could do, no changetook place in his manner.  \'But to-morrow,\' thought she, exultinglyrecovering her disappointment--\'to-morrow, alas for Glaucus!\'Alas for him, indeed!Chapter IVTHE STORY HALTS FOR A MOMENT AT AN EPISODE.RESTLESS and anxious, Apaecides consumed the day in wandering throughthe most sequestered walks in the vicinity of the city.  The sun wasslowly setting as he paused beside a lonely part of the Sarnus, ere yetit wound amidst the evidences of luxury and power. Only through openingsin the woods and vines were caught glimpses of the white and gleamingcity, in which was heard in the distance no din, no sound, nor \'busiesthum of men\'.  Amidst the green banks crept the lizard and thegrasshopper, and here and there in the brake some solitary bird burstinto sudden song, as suddenly stifled. There was deep calm around, butnot the calm of night; the air still breathed of the freshness and lifeof day; the grass still moved to the stir of the insect horde; and onthe opposite bank the graceful and white capella passed browsing throughthe herbage, and paused at the wave to drink.As Apaecides stood musingly gazing upon the waters, he heard beside himthe low bark of a dog.\'Be still, poor friend,\' said a voice at hand; \'the stranger\'s stepharms not thy master.\' The convert recognized the voice, and, turning,he beheld the old mysterious man whom he had seen in the congregation ofthe Nazarenes.The old man was sitting upon a fragment of stone covered with ancientmosses; beside him were his staff and scrip; at his feet lay a smallshaggy dog, the companion in how many a pilgrimage perilous and strange.The face of the old man was as balm to the excited spirit of theneophyte: he approached, and craving his blessing, sat down beside him.\'Thou art provided as for a journey, father,\' said he: \'wilt thou leaveus yet?\'\'My son,\' replied the old man, \'the days in store for me on earth arefew and scanty; I employ them as becomes me travelling from place toplace, comforting those whom God has gathered together in His name, andproclaiming the glory of His Son, as testified to His servant.\'\'Thou hast looked, they tell me, on the face of Christ?\'\'And the face revived me from the dead.  Know, young proselyte to thetrue faith, that I am he of whom thou readest in the scroll of theApostle.  In the far Judea, and in the city of Nain, there dwelt awidow, humble of spirit and sad of heart; for of all the ties of lifeone son alone was spared to her.  And she loved him with a melancholylove, for he was the likeness of the lost.  And the son died.  The reedon which she leaned was broken, the oil was dried up in the widow\'scruse.  They bore the dead upon his bier; and near the gate of the city,where the crowd were gathered, there came a silence over the sounds ofwoe, for the Son of God was passing by.  The mother, who followed thebier, wept--not noisily, but all who looked upon her saw that her heartwas crushed.  And the Lord pitied her, and he touched the bier, andsaid, ""I SAY UNTO THEE, ARISE,"" And the dead man woke and looked uponthe face of the Lord.  Oh, that calm and solemn brow, that unutterablesmile, that careworn and sorrowful face, lighted up with a God\'sbenignity--it chased away the shadows of the grave!  I rose, I spoke, Iwas living, and in my mother\'s arms--yes, I am the dead revived! Thepeople shouted, the funeral horns rung forth merrily: there was a cry,""God has visited His people!"" I heard them not--I felt--I saw--nothingbut the face of the Redeemer!\'The old man paused, deeply moved; and the youth felt his blood creep,and his hair stir.  He was in the presence of one who had known theMystery of Death!\'Till that time,\' renewed the widow\'s son, \'I had been as other men:thoughtless, not abandoned; taking no heed, but of the things of loveand life; nay, I had inclined to the gloomy faith of the earthlySadducee!  But, raised from the dead, from awful and desert dreams thatthese lips never dare reveal--recalled upon earth, to testify the powersof Heaven--once more mortal, the witness of immortality; I drew a newbeing from the grave.  O faded--O lost Jerusalem!--Him from whom came mylife, I beheld adjudged to the agonized and parching death!  Far in themighty crowd I saw the light rest and glimmer over the cross; I heardthe hooting mob, I cried aloud, I raved, I threatened--none heeded me--Iwas lost in the whirl and the roar of thousands!  But even then, in myagony and His own, methought the glazing eye of the Son of Man sought meout--His lip smiled, as when it conquered death--it hushed me, and Ibecame calm.  He who had defied the grave for another--what was thegrave to him?  The sun shone aslant the pale and powerful features, andthen died away!  Darkness fell over the earth; how long it endured, Iknow not.  A loud cry came through the gloom--a sharp and bittercry!--and all was silent.\'But who shall tell the terrors of the night?\' I walked along thecity--the earth reeled to and fro, and the houses trembled to theirbase--theliving had deserted the streets, but not the Dead: through thegloom I saw them glide--the dim and ghastly shapes, in the cerements ofthe grave--with horror, and woe, and warning on their unmoving lips andlightless eyes!--they swept by me, as I passed--they glared upon me--Ihad been their brother; and they bowed their heads in recognition; theyhad risen to tell the living that the dead can rise!\'Again the old man paused, and, when he resumed, it was in a calmer tone.\'From that night I resigned all earthly thought but that of serving HIM.A preacher and a pilgrim, I have traversed the remotest corners of theearth, proclaiming His Divinity, and bringing new converts to His fold.I come as the wind, and as the wind depart; sowing, as the wind sows,the seeds that enrich the world.\'Son, on earth we shall meet no more.  Forget not this hour,--what arethe pleasures and the pomps of life?  As the lamp shines, so lifeglitters for an hour; but the soul\'s light is the star that burns forever, in the heart of inimitable space.\'It was then that their conversation fell upon the general and sublimedoctrines of immortality; it soothed and elevated the young mind of theconvert, which yet clung to many of the damps and shadows of that cellof faith which he had so lately left--it was the air of heaven breathingon the prisoner released at last.  There was a strong and markeddistinction between the Christianity of the old man and that ofOlinthus; that of the first was more soft, more gentle, more divine.The heroism of Olinthus had something in it fierce and intolerant--itwas necessary to the part he was destined to play--it had in it more ofthe courage of the martyr than the charity of the saint.  It aroused, itexcited, it nerved, rather than subdued and softened.  But the wholeheart of that divine old man was bathed in love; the smile of the Deityhad burned away from it the leaven of earthlier and coarser passions,and left to the energy of the hero all the meekness of the child.\'And now,\' said he, rising at length, as the sun\'s last ray died in thewest; \'now, in the cool of twilight, I pursue my way towards theImperial Rome.  There yet dwell some holy men, who like me have beheldthe face of Christ; and them would I see before I die.\'\'But the night is chill for thine age, my father, and the way is long,and the robber haunts it; rest thee till to-morrow.\'\'Kind son, what is there in this scrip to tempt the robber?  And theNight and the Solitude!--these make the ladder round which angelscluster, and beneath which my spirit can dream of God.  Oh! none canknow what the pilgrim feels as he walks on his holy course; nursing nofear, and dreading no danger--for God is with him!  He hears the windsmurmur glad tidings; the woods sleep in the shadow of Almightywings--the stars are the Scriptures of Heaven, the tokens of love, andthe witnesses of immortality.  Night is the Pilgrim\'s day.\' With thesewords the old man pressed Apaecides to his breast, and taking up hisstaff and scrip, the dog bounded cheerily before him, and with slowsteps and downcast eyes he went his way.The convert stood watching his bended form, till the trees shut the lastglimpse from his view; and then, as the stars broke forth, he woke fromthe musings with a start, reminded of his appointment with Olinthus.Chapter VTHE PHILTRE.  ITS EFFECT.WHEN Glaucus arrived at his own home, he found Nydia seated under theportico of his garden.  In fact, she had sought his house in the merechance that he might return at an early hour: anxious, fearful,anticipative, she resolved upon seizing the earliest opportunity ofavailing herself of the love-charm, while at the same time she halfhoped the opportunity might be deferred.It was then, in that fearful burning mood, her heart beating, her cheekflushing, that Nydia awaited the possibility of Glaucus\'s return beforethe night.  He crossed the portico just as the first stars began torise, and the heaven above had assumed its most purple robe.\'Ho, my child, wait you for me?\'\'Nay, I have been tending the flowers, and did but linger a little whileto rest myself.\'\'It has been warm,\' said Glaucus, placing himself also on one of theseats beneath the colonnade.\'Very.\'\'Wilt thou summon Davus?  The wine I have drunk heats me, and I long forsome cooling drink.\'Here at once, suddenly and unexpectedly, the very opportunity that Nydiaawaited presented itself; of himself, at his own free choice, heafforded to her that occasion.  She breathed quick--\'I will prepare foryou myself,\' said she, \'the summer draught that Ione loves--of honey andweak wine cooled in snow.\'\'Thanks,\' said the unconscious Glaucus.  \'If Ione love it, enough; itwould be grateful were it poison.\'Nydia frowned, and then smiled; she withdrew for a few moments, andreturned with the cup containing the beverage.  Glaucus took it from herhand.  What would not Nydia have given then for one hour\'s prerogativeof sight, to have watched her hopes ripening to effect--to have seen thefirst dawn of the imagined love--to have worshipped with more thanPersian adoration the rising of that sun which her credulous soulbelieved was to break upon her dreary night!  Far different, as shestood then and there, were the thoughts, the emotions of the blind girl,from those of the vain Pompeian under a similar suspense.  In the last,what poor and frivolous passions had made up the daring whole! Whatpetty pique, what small revenge, what expectation of a paltry triumph,had swelled the attributes of that sentiment she dignified with the nameof love! but in the wild heart of the Thessalian all was pure,uncontrolled, unmodified passion--erring, unwomanly, frenzied, butdebased by no elements of a more sordid feeling. Filled with love aswith life itself, how could she resist the occasion of winning love inreturn!She leaned for support against the wall, and her face, before soflushed, was now white as snow, and with her delicate hands claspedconvulsively together, her lips apart, her eyes on the ground, shewaited the next words Glaucus should utter.Glaucus had raised the cup to his lips, he had already drained about afourth of its contents, when his eye suddenly glancing upon the face ofNydia, he was so forcibly struck by its alteration, by its intense, andpainful, and strange expression, that he paused abruptly, and stillholding the cup near his lips, exclaimed:\'Why, Nydia! Nydia! I say, art thou ill or in pain?  Nay, thy facespeaks for thee.  What ails my poor child?\'  As he spoke, he put downthe cup and rose from his seat to approach her, when a sudden pang shotcoldly to his heart, and was followed by a wild, confused, dizzysensation at the brain. The floor seemed to glide from under him--hisfeet seemed to move on air--a mighty and unearthly gladness rushed uponhis spirit--he felt too buoyant for the earth--he longed for wings, nay,it seemed in the buoyancy of his new existence, as if he possessed them.He burst involuntarily into a loud and thrilling laugh.  He clapped hishands--he bounded aloft--he was as a Pythoness inspired; suddenly as itcame this preternatural transport passed, though only partially, away.He now felt his blood rushing loudly and rapidly through his veins; itseemed to swell, to exult, to leap along, as a stream that has burst itsbounds, and hurries to the ocean.  It throbbed in his ear with a mightysound, he felt it mount to his brow, he felt the veins in the templesstretch and swell as if they could no longer contain the violent andincreasing tide--then a kind of darkness fell over his eyes--darkness,but not entire; for through the dim shade he saw the opposite walls glowout, and the figures painted thereon seemed, ghost-like, to creep andglide.  What was most strange, he did not feel himself ill--he did notsink or quail beneath the dread frenzy that was gathering over him. Thenovelty of the feelings seemed bright and vivid--he felt as if a youngerhealth had been infused into his frame.  He was gliding on tomadness--and he knew it not!Nydia had not answered his first question--she had not been able toreply--his wild and fearful laugh had roused her from her passionatesuspense: she could not see his fierce gesture--she could not mark hisreeling and unsteady step as he paced unconsciously to and fro; but sheheard the words, broken, incoherent, insane, that gushed from his lips.She became terrified and appalled--she hastened to him, feeling with herarms until she touched his knees, and then falling on the ground sheembraced them, weeping with terror and excitement.\'Oh, speak to me! speak! you do not hate me?--speak, speak!\'\'By the bright goddess, a beautiful land this Cyprus!  Ho! how they fillus with wine instead of blood! now they open the veins of the Faunyonder, to show how the tide within bubbles and sparkles.  Come hither,jolly old god! thou ridest on a goat, eh?--what long silky hair he has!He is worth all the coursers of Parthia.  But a word with thee--thiswine of thine is too strong for us mortals.  Oh! beautiful! the boughsare at rest! the green waves of the forest have caught the Zephyr anddrowned him!  Not a breath stirs the leaves--and I view the Dreamssleeping with folded wings upon the motionless elm; and I look beyond,and I see a blue stream sparkle in the silent noon; a fountain--afountain springing aloft!  Ah! my fount, thou wilt not put out rays ofmy Grecian sun, though thou triest ever so hard with thy nimble andsilver arms.  And now, what form steals yonder through the boughs? sheglides like a moonbeam!--she has a garland of oak-leaves on her head.In her hand is a vase upturned, from which she pours pink and tinyshells and sparkling water.  Oh! look on yon face!  Man never before sawits like.  See! we are alone; only I and she in the wide forest.  Thereis no smile upon her lips--she moves, grave and sweetly sad.  Ha! fly,it is a nymph!--it is one of the wild Napaeae!  Whoever sees her becomesmad--fly! see, she discovers me!\'\'Oh! Glaucus! Glaucus! do you not know me?  Rave not so wildly, or thouwilt kill me with a word!\'A new change seemed now to operate upon the jarring and disordered mindof the unfortunate Athenian.  He put his hand upon Nydia\'s silken hair;he smoothed the locks--he looked wistfully upon her face, and then, asin the broken chain of thought one or two links were yet unsevered, itseemed that her countenance brought its associations of Ione; and withthat remembrance his madness became yet more powerful, and it swayed andtinged by passion, as he burst forth:\'I swear by Venus, by Diana, and by Juno, that though I have now theworld on my shoulders, as my countryman Hercules (ah, dull Rome! whoeverwas truly great was of Greece; why, you would be godless if it were notfor us!)--I say, as my countryman Hercules had before me, I would let itfall into chaos for one smile from Ione.  Ah, Beautiful,--Adored,\' headded, in a voice inexpressibly fond and plaintive, \'thou lovest me not.Thou art unkind to me.  The Egyptian hath belied me to thee--thouknowest not what hours I have spent beneath thy casement--thou knowestnot how I have outwatched the stars, thinking thou, my sun, wouldst riseat last--and thou lovest me not, thou forsakest me!  Oh! do not leave menow!  I feel that my life will not be long; let me gaze on thee at leastunto the last.  I am of the bright land of thy fathers--I have trod theheights of Phyle--I have gathered the hyacinth and rose amidst theolive-groves of Ilyssus.  Thou shouldst not desert me, for thy fatherswere brothers to my own.  And they say this land is lovely, and theseclimes serene, but I will bear thee with me--Ho! dark form, why risestthou like a cloud between me and mine?  Death sits calmly dread upon thybrow--on thy lip is the smile that slays: thy name is Orcus, but onearth men call thee Arbaces.  See, I know thee! fly, dim shadow, thyspells avail not!\'\'Glaucus! Glaucus!\' murmured Nydia, releasing her hold and falling,beneath the excitement of her dismay, remorse, and anguish, insensibleon the floor.\'Who calls?\' said he in a loud voice.  \'Ione, it is she! they have borneher off--we will save her--where is my stilus?  Ha, I have it!  I come,Ione, to thy rescue!  I come!  I come!\'So saying, the Athenian with one bound passed the portico, he traversedthe house, and rushed with swift but vacillating steps, and mutteringaudibly to himself, down the starlit streets.  The direful potion burntlike fire in his veins, for its effect was made, perhaps, still moresudden from the wine he had drunk previously.  Used to the excesses ofnocturnal revellers, the citizens, with smiles and winks, gave way tohis reeling steps; they naturally imagined him under the influence ofthe Bromian god, not vainly worshipped at Pompeii; but they who lookedtwice upon his face started in a nameless fear, and the smile witheredfrom their lips.  He passed the more populous streets; and, pursuingmechanically the way to Ione\'s house, he traversed a more desertedquarter, and entered now the lonely grove of Cybele, in which Apaecideshad held his interview with Olinthus.Chapter VIA REUNION OF DIFFERENT ACTORS.  STREAMS THAT FLOWED APPARENTLY APARTRUSH INTO ONE GULF.IMPATIENT to learn whether the fell drug had yet been administered byJulia to his hated rival, and with what effect, Arbaces resolved, as theevening came on, to seek her house, and satisfy his suspense. It wascustomary, as I have before said, for men at that time to carry abroadwith them the tablets and the stilus attached to their girdle; and withthe girdle they were put off when at home.  In fact, under theappearance of a literary instrument, the Romans carried about with themin that same stilus a very sharp and formidable weapon.  It was with hisstilus that Cassius stabbed Caesar in the senate-house.  Taking, then,his girdle and his cloak, Arbaces left his house, supporting his steps,which were still somewhat feeble (though hope and vengeance hadconspired greatly with his own medical science, which was profound, torestore his natural strength), by his long staff--Arbaces took his wayto the villa of Diomed.And beautiful is the moonlight of the south!  In those climes the nightso quickly glides into the day, that twilight scarcely makes a bridgebetween them.  One moment of darker purple in the sky--of a thousandrose-hues in the water--of shade half victorious over light; and thenburst forth at once the countless stars--the moon is up--night hasresumed her reign!Brightly then, and softly bright, fell the moonbeams over the antiquegrove consecrated to Cybele--the stately trees, whose date went beyondtradition, cast their long shadows over the soil, while through theopenings in their boughs the stars shone, still and frequent.  Thewhiteness of the small sacellum in the centre of the grove, amidst thedark foliage, had in it something abrupt and startling; it recalled atonce the purpose to which the wood was consecrated--its holiness andsolemnity.With a swift and stealthy pace, Calenus, gliding under the shade of thetrees, reached the chapel, and gently putting back the boughs thatcompletely closed around its rear, settled himself in his concealment; aconcealment so complete, what with the fane in front and the treesbehind, that no unsuspicious passenger could possibly have detected him.Again, all was apparently solitary in the grove: afar off you heardfaintly the voices of some noisy revellers or the music that playedcheerily to the groups that then, as now in those climates, during thenights of summer, lingered in the streets, and enjoyed, in the fresh airand the liquid moonlight, a milder day.From the height on which the grove was placed, you saw through theintervals of the trees the broad and purple sea, rippling in thedistance, the white villas of Stabiae in the curving shore, and the dimLectiarian hills mingling with the delicious sky.  Presently the tallfigure of Arbaces, in his way to the house of Diomed, entered theextreme end of the grove; and at the same instant Apaecides, also boundto his appointment with Olinthus, crossed the Egyptian\'s path.\'Hem! Apaecides,\' said Arbaces, recognizing the priest at a glance;\'when last we met, you were my foe.  I have wished since then to seeyou, for I would have you still my pupil and my friend.\'Apaecides started at the voice of the Egyptian; and halting abruptly,gazed upon him with a countenance full of contending, bitter, andscornful emotions.\'Villain and impostor!\' said he at length; \'thou hast recovered thenfrom the jaws of the grave!  But think not again to weave around me thyguilty meshes.  Retiarius, I am armed against thee!\'\'Hush!\' said Arbaces, in a very low voice--but his pride, which in thatdescendant of kings was great, betrayed the wound it received from theinsulting epithets of the priest in the quiver of his lip and the flushof his tawny brow.  \'Hush! more low! thou mayest be overheard, and ifother ears than mine had drunk those sounds--why...\'\'Dost thou threaten?--what if the whole city had heard me?\'\'The manes of my ancestors would not have suffered me to forgive thee.But, hold, and hear me.  Thou art enraged that I would have offeredviolence to thy sister.  Nay, peace, peace, but one instant, I praythee.  Thou art right; it was the frenzy of passion and of jealousy--Ihave repented bitterly of my madness.  Forgive me; I, who never imploredpardon of living man, beseech thee now to forgive me. Nay, I will atonethe insult--I ask thy sister in marriage--start not--consider--what isthe alliance of yon holiday Greek compared to mine?  Wealthunbounded--birth that in its far antiquity leaves your Greek and Romannames the things of yesterday--science--but that thou knowest!  Give methy sister, and my whole life shall atone a moment\'s error.\'\'Egyptian, were even I to consent, my sister loathes the very air thoubreathest: but I have my own wrongs to forgive--I may pardon thee thatthou hast made me a tool to thy deceits, but never that thou hastseduced me to become the abettor of thy vices--a polluted and a perjuredman. Tremble!--even now I prepare the hour in which thou and thy falsegods shall be unveiled.  Thy lewd and Circean life shall be dragged today--thy mumming oracles disclosed--the fane of the idol Isis shall be abyword and a scorn--the name of Arbaces a mark for the hisses ofexecration!  Tremble!\'The flush on the Egyptian\'s brow was succeeded by a livid paleness.  Helooked behind, before, around, to feel assured that none were by; andthen he fixed his dark and dilating eye on the priest, with such a gazeof wrath and menace, that one, perhaps, less supported than Apaecides bythe fervent daring of a divine zeal, could not have faced withunflinching look that lowering aspect. As it was, however, the youngconvert met it unmoved, and returned it with an eye of proud defiance.\'Apaecides,\' said the Egyptian, in a tremulous and inward tone, \'beware!What is it thou wouldst meditate?  Speakest thou--reflect, pause beforethou repliest--from the hasty influences of wrath, as yet divining nosettled purpose, or from some fixed design?\'\'I speak from the inspiration of the True God, whose servant I now am,\'answered the Christian, boldly; \'and in the knowledge that by His gracehuman courage has already fixed the date of thy hypocrisy and thydemon\'s worship; ere thrice the sun has dawned, thou wilt know all!Dark sorcerer, tremble, and farewell!\'All the fierce and lurid passions which he inherited from his nation andhis clime, at all times but ill concealed beneath the blandness of craftand the coldness of philosophy, were released in the breast of theEgyptian. Rapidly one thought chased another; he saw before him anobstinate barrier to even a lawful alliance with Ione--thefellow-champion of Glaucus in the struggle which had baffled hisdesigns--the reviler of his name--the threatened desecrator of thegoddess he served while he disbelieved--the avowed and approachingrevealer of his own impostures and vices.  His love, his repute, nay,his very life, might be in danger--the day and hour seemed even to havebeen fixed for some design against him.  He knew by the words of theconvert that Apaecides had adopted the Christian faith: he knew theindomitable zeal which led on the proselytes of that creed.  Such washis enemy; he grasped his stilus--that enemy was in his power! They werenow before the chapel; one hasty glance once more he cast around; he sawnone near--silence and solitude alike tempted him.\'Die, then, in thy rashness!\' he muttered; \'away, obstacle to my rushingfates!\'And just as the young Christian had turned to depart, Arbaces raised hishand high over the left shoulder of Apaecides, and plunged his sharpweapon twice into his breast.Apaecides fell to the ground pierced to the heart--he fell mute, withouteven a groan, at the very base of the sacred chapel.Arbaces gazed upon him for a moment with the fierce animal joy ofconquest over a foe.  But presently the full sense of the danger towhich he was exposed flashed upon him; he wiped his weapon carefully inthe long grass, and with the very garments of his victim; drew his cloakround him, and was about to depart, when he saw, coming up the path,right before him, the figure of a young man, whose steps reeled andvacillated strangely as he advanced: the quiet moonlight streamed fullupon his face, which seemed, by the whitening ray, colorless as marble.The Egyptian recognized the face and form of Glaucus.  The unfortunateand benighted Greek was chanting a disconnected and mad song, composedfrom snatches of hymns and sacred odes, all jarringly woven together.\'Ha!\' thought the Egyptian, instantaneously divining his state and itsterrible cause; \'so, then, the hell-draught works, and destiny hath sentthee hither to crush two of my foes at once!\'Quickly, even ere this thought occurred to him, he had withdrawn on oneside of the chapel, and concealed himself amongst the boughs; from thatlurking place he watched, as a tiger in his lair, the advance of hissecond victim. He noted the wandering and restless fire in the brightand beautiful eyes of the Athenian; the convulsions that distorted hisstatue-like features, and writhed his hueless lip.  He saw that theGreek was utterly deprived of reason.  Nevertheless, as Glaucus came upto the dead body of Apaecides, from which the dark red stream flowedslowly over the grass, so strange and ghastly a spectacle could not failto arrest him, benighted and erring as was his glimmering sense.  Hepaused, placed his hand to his brow, as if to collect himself, and thensaying:\'What ho! Endymion, sleepest thou so soundly?  What has the moon said tothee?  Thou makest me jealous; it is time to wake\'--he stooped down withthe intention of lifting up the body.Forgetting--feeling not--his own debility, the Egyptian sprung from hishiding-place, and, as the Greek bent, struck him forcibly to the ground,over the very body of the Christian; then, raising his powerful voice toits highest pitch, he shouted:\'Ho, citizens--oh! help me!--run hither--hither!--A murder--a murderbefore your very fane!  Help, or the murderer escapes!\' As he spoke, heplaced his foot on the breast of Glaucus: an idle and superfluousprecaution; for the potion operating with the fall, the Greek lay theremotionless and insensible, save that now and then his lips gave vent tosome vague and raving sounds.As he there stood awaiting the coming of those his voice still continuedto summons, perhaps some remorse, some compunctious visitings--fordespite his crimes he was human--haunted the breast of the Egyptian; thedefenceless state of Glaucus--his wandering words--his shattered reason,smote him even more than the death of Apaecides, and he said, halfaudibly, to himself:\'Poor clay!--poor human reason; where is the soul now?  I could sparethee, O my rival--rival never more!  But destiny must be obeyed--mysafety demands thy sacrifice.\' With that, as if to drown compunction, heshouted yet more loudly; and drawing from the girdle of Glaucus thestilus it contained, he steeped it in the blood of the murdered man, andlaid it beside the corpse.And now, fast and breathless, several of the citizens came thronging tothe place, some with torches, which the moon rendered unnecessary, butwhich flared red and tremulously against the darkness of the trees; theysurrounded the spot.  \'Lift up yon corpse,\' said the Egyptian, \'andguard well the murderer.\'They raised the body, and great was their horror and sacred indignationto discover in that lifeless clay a priest of the adored and venerableIsis; but still greater, perhaps, was their surprise, when they foundthe accused in the brilliant and admired Athenian.\'Glaucus!\' cried the bystanders, with one accord; \'is it even credible?\'\'I would sooner,\' whispered one man to his neighbor, \'believe it to bethe Egyptian himself.\'Here a centurion thrust himself into the gathering crowd, with an air ofauthority.\'How! blood spilt! who the murderer?\'The bystanders pointed to Glaucus.\'He!--by Mars, he has rather the air of being the victim!\'Who accuses him?\'\'I,\' said Arbaces, drawing himself up haughtily; and the jewels whichadorned his dress flashing in the eyes of the soldier, instantlyconvinced that worthy warrior of the witness\'s respectability.\'Pardon me--your name?\' said he.\'Arbaces; it is well known methinks in Pompeii.  Passing through thegrove, I beheld before me the Greek and the priest in earnestconversation.  I was struck by the reeling motions of the first, hisviolent gestures, and the loudness of his voice; he seemed to me eitherdrunk or mad.  Suddenly I saw him raise his stilus--I dartedforward--too late to arrest the blow.  He had twice stabbed his victim,and was bending over him, when, in my horror and indignation, I struckthe murderer to the ground.  He fell without a struggle, which makes meyet more suspect that he was not altogether in his senses when the crimewas perpetrated; for, recently recovered from a severe illness, my blowwas comparatively feeble, and the frame of Glaucus, as you see, isstrong and youthful.\'\'His eyes are open now--his lips move,\' said the soldier. \'Speak,prisoner, what sayest thou to the charge?\'\'The charge--ha--ha!  Why, it was merrily done; when the old hag set herserpent at me, and Hecate stood by laughing from ear to ear--what couldI do?  But I am ill--I faint--the serpent\'s fiery tongue hath bitten me.Bear me to bed, and send for your physician; old AEsculapius himselfwill attend me if you let him know that I am Greek.  Oh, mercy--mercy!I burn!--marrow and brain, I burn!\'And, with a thrilling and fierce groan, the Athenian fell back in thearms of the bystanders.\'He raves,\' said the officer, compassionately; \'and in his delirium hehas struck the priest.  Hath any one present seen him to-day!\'\'I,\' said one of the spectators, \'beheld him in the morning.  He passedmy shop and accosted me.  He seemed well and sane as the stoutest ofus!\'\'And I saw him half an hour ago,\' said another, \'passing up the streets,muttering to himself with strange gestures, and just as the Egyptian hasdescribed.\'\'A corroboration of the witness! it must be too true.  He must at allevents to the praetor; a pity, so young and so rich!  But the crime isdreadful: a priest of Isis, in his very robes, too, and at the baseitself of our most ancient chapel!\'At these words the crowd were reminded more forcibly, than in theirexcitement and curiosity they had yet been, of the heinousness of thesacrilege.  They shuddered in pious horror.\'No wonder the earth has quaked,\' said one, \'when it held such amonster!\'\'Away with him to prison--away!\' cried they all.And one solitary voice was heard shrilly and joyously above the rest:\'The beasts will not want a gladiator now,  Ho, ho, for the merry, merryshow!It was the voice of the young woman whose conversation with Medon hasbeen repeated.\'True--true--it chances in season for the games!\' cried several; and atthat thought all pity for the accused seemed vanished.  His youth, hisbeauty, but fitted him better for the purpose of the arena.\'Bring hither some planks--or if at hand, a litter--to bear the dead,\'said Arbaces: \'a priest of Isis ought scarcely to be carried to histemple by vulgar hands, like a butchered gladiator.\'At this the bystanders reverently laid the corpse of Apaecides on theground, with the face upwards; and some of them went in search of somecontrivance to bear the body, untouched by the profane.It was just at that time that the crowd gave way to right and left as asturdy form forced itself through, and Olinthus the Christian stoodimmediately confronting the Egyptian.  But his eyes, at first, onlyrested with inexpressible grief and horror on that gory side andupturned face, on which the agony of violent death yet lingered.\'Murdered!\' he said.  \'Is it thy zeal that has brought thee to this?Have they detected thy noble purpose, and by death prevented their ownshame?\'He turned his head abruptly, and his eyes fell full on the solemnfeatures of the Egyptian.As he looked, you might see in his face, and even the slight shiver ofhis frame, the repugnance and aversion which the Christian felt for onewhom he knew to be so dangerous and so criminal.  It was indeed the gazeof the bird upon the basilisk--so silent was it and so prolonged.  Butshaking off the sudden chill that had crept over him, Olinthus extendedhis right arm towards Arbaces, and said, in a deep and loud voice:\'Murder hath been done upon this corpse!  Where is the murderer? Standforth, Egyptian!  For, as the Lord liveth, I believe thou art the man!\'An anxious and perturbed change might for one moment be detected on thedusky features of Arbaces; but it gave way to the frowning expression ofindignation and scorn, as, awed and arrested by the suddenness andvehemence of the charge, the spectators pressed nearer and nearer uponthe two more prominent actors.\'I know,\' said Arbaces, proudly, \'who is my accuser, and I guesswherefore he thus arraigns me.  Men and citizens, know this man for themost bitter of the Nazarenes, if that or Christians be their propername!  What marvel that in his malignity he dares accuse even anEgyptian of the murder of a priest of Egypt!\'\'I know him!  I know the dog!\' shouted several voices.  \'It is Olinthusthe Christian--or rather the Atheist--he denies the gods!\'\'Peace, brethren,\' said Olinthus, with dignity, \'and hear me!  Thismurdered priest of Isis before his death embraced the Christianfaith--he revealed to me the dark sins, the sorceries of yonEgyptian--the mummeries and delusions of the fane of Isis.  He was aboutto declare them publicly.  He, a stranger, unoffending, without enemies!who should shed his blood but one of those who feared his witness?  Whomight fear that testimony the most?--Arbaces, the Egyptian!\'\'You hear him!\' said Arbaces; \'you hear him! he blasphemes!  Ask him ifhe believes in Isis!\'\'Do I believe in an evil demon?\' returned Olinthus, boldly.A groan and shudder passed through the assembly.  Nothing daunted, forprepared at every time for peril, and in the present excitement losingall prudence, the Christian continued:\'Back, idolaters! this clay is not for your vain and polluting rites--itis to us--to the followers of Christ, that the last offices due to aChristian belong.  I claim this dust in the name of the great Creatorwho has recalled the spirit!\'With so solemn and commanding a voice and aspect the Christian spokethese words, that even the crowd forbore to utter aloud the execrationof fear and hatred which in their hearts they conceived. And never,perhaps, since Lucifer and the Archangel contended for the body of themighty Lawgiver, was there a more striking subject for the painter\'sgenius than that scene exhibited.  The dark trees--the stately fane--themoon full on the corpse of the deceased--the torches tossing wildly toand fro in the rear--the various faces of the motley audience--theinsensible form of the Athenian, supported, in the distance, and in theforeground, and above all, the forms of Arbaces and the Christian: thefirst drawn to its full height, far taller than the herd around; hisarms folded, his brow knit, his eyes fixed, his lip slightly curled indefiance and disdain.  The last bearing, on a brow worn and furrowed,the majesty of an equal command--the features stern, yet frank--theaspect bold, yet open--the quiet dignity of the whole form impressedwith an ineffable earnestness, hushed, as it were, in a solemn sympathywith the awe he himself had created.  His left hand pointing to thecorpse--his right hand raised to heaven.The centurion pressed forward again.\'In the first place, hast thou, Olinthus, or whatever be thy name, anyproof of the charge thou hast made against Arbaces, beyond thy vaguesuspicions?\'Olinthus remained silent--the Egyptian laughed contemptuously.\'Dost thou claim the body of a priest of Isis as one of the Nazarene orChristian sect?\'\'I do.\'\'Swear then by yon fane, yon statue of Cybele, by yon most ancientsacellum in Pompeii, that the dead man embraced your faith!\'\'Vain man!  I disown your idols!  I abhor your temples!  How can I swearby Cybele then?\'\'Away, away with the Atheist! away! the earth will swallow us, if wesuffer these blasphemers in a sacred grove--away with him to death!\'\'To the beasts!\' added a female voice in the centre of the crowd; \'weshall have one a-piece now for the lion and tiger!\'\'If, O Nazarene, thou disbelievest in Cybele, which of our gods dostthou own?\' resumed the soldier, unmoved by the cries around.\'None!\'\'Hark to him! hark!\' cried the crowd.\'O vain and blind!\' continued the Christian, raising his voice: \'can youbelieve in images of wood and stone?  Do you imagine that they have eyesto see, or ears to hear, or hands to help ye?  Is yon mute thing carvedby man\'s art a goddess!--hath it made mankind?--alas! by mankind was itmade. Lo! convince yourself of its nothingness--of your folly.\'And as he spoke he strode across to the fane, and ere any of thebystanders were aware of his purpose, he, in his compassion or his zeal,struck the statue of wood from its pedestal.\'See!\' cried he, \'your goddess cannot avenge herself.  Is this a thingto worship?\'Further words were denied to him: so gross and daring a sacrilege--ofone, too, of the most sacred of their places of worship--filled even themost lukewarm with rage and horror.  With one accord the crowd rushedupon him, seized, and but for the interference of the centurion, theywould have torn him to pieces.\'Peace!\' said the soldier, authoritatively--\'refer we this insolentblasphemer to the proper tribunal--time has been already wasted.  Bearwe both the culprits to the magistrates; place the body of the priest onthe litter--carry it to his own home.\'At this moment a priest of Isis stepped forward.  \'I claim theseremains, according to the custom of the priesthood.\'\'The flamen be obeyed,\' said the centurion.  \'How is the murderer?\'\'Insensible or asleep.\'\'Were his crimes less, I could pity him.  On!\'Arbaces, as he turned, met the eye of that priest of Isis--it wasCalenus; and something there was in that glance, so significant andsinister, that the Egyptian muttered to himself:\'Could he have witnessed the deed?\'A girl darted from the crowd, and gazed hard on the face of Olinthus.\'By Jupiter, a stout knave!  I say, we shall have a man for the tigernow; one for each beast!\'\'Ho!\' shouted the mob; \'a man for the lion, and another for the tiger!What luck!  Io Paean!\'Chapter VIIIN WHICH THE READER LEARNS THE CONDITION OF GLAUCUS.  FRIENDSHIP TESTED.ENMITY SOFTENED.  LOVE THE SAME, BECAUSE THE ONE LOVING IS BLIND.THE night was somewhat advanced, and the gay lounging places of thePompeians were still crowded.  You might observe in the countenances ofthe various idlers a more earnest expression than usual.  They talked inlarge knots and groups, as if they sought by numbers to divide thehalf-painful, half-pleasurable anxiety which belonged to the subjecton which they conversed: it was a subject of life and death.A young man passed briskly by the graceful portico of the Temple ofFortune--so briskly, indeed, that he came with no slight force fullagainst the rotund and comely form of that respectable citizen Diomed,who was retiring homeward to his suburban villa.\'Holloa!\' groaned the merchant, recovering with some difficulty hisequilibrium; \'have you no eyes? or do you think I have no feeling? ByJupiter! you have well nigh driven out the divine particle; such anothershock, and my soul will be in Hades!\'\'Ah, Diomed! is it you?  forgive my inadvertence.  I was absorbed inthinking of the reverses of life.  Our poor friend, Glaucus, eh! whocould have guessed it?\'\'Well, but tell me, Clodius, is he really to be tried by the senate?\'\'Yes; they say the crime is of so extraordinary a nature that the senateitself must adjudge it; and so the lictors are to induct him formally.\'\'He has been accused publicly, then?\'\'To be sure; where have you been not to hear that?\'\'Why, I have only just returned from Neapolis, whither I went onbusiness the very morning after his crime--so shocking, and at my housethe same night that it happened!\'\'There is no doubt of his guilt,\' said Clodius, shrugging his shoulders;\'and as these crimes take precedence of all little undignifiedpeccadilloes, they will hasten to finish the sentence previous to thegames.\'\'The games!  Good gods!\' replied Diomed, with a slight shudder: \'canthey adjudge him to the beasts?--so young, so rich!\'\'True; but then he is a Greek.  Had he been a Roman, it would have beena thousand pities.  These foreigners can be borne with in theirprosperity; but in adversity we must not forget that they are in realityslaves. However, we of the upper classes are always tender-hearted; andhe would certainly get off tolerably well if he were left to us: for,between ourselves, what is a paltry priest of Isis!--what Isis herself?But the common people are superstitious; they clamor for the blood ofthe sacrilegious one.  It is dangerous not to give way to publicopinion.\'\'And the blasphemer--the Christian, or Nazarene, or whatever else he becalled?\'\'Oh, poor dog! if he will sacrifice to Cybele or Isis, he will bepardoned--if not, the tiger has him.  At least, so I suppose; but thetrial will decide.  We talk while the urn\'s still empty.  And the Greekmay yet escape the deadly Theta of his own alphabet.  But enough of thisgloomy subject.  How is the fair Julia?\'\'Well, I fancy.\'\'Commend me to her.  But hark! the door yonder creaks on its hinges; itis the house of the praetor.  Who comes forth?  By Pollux! it is theEgyptian! What can he want with our official friend!\'\'Some conference touching the murder, doubtless,\' replied Diomed; \'butwhat was supposed to be the inducement to the crime? Glaucus was to havemarried the priest\'s sister.\'\'Yes: some say Apaecides refused the alliance.  It might have been asudden quarrel.  Glaucus was evidently drunk--nay, so much so as tohave been quite insensible when taken up, and I hear is stilldelirious--whether with wine, terror, remorse, the Furies, or theBacchanals, I cannot say.\'\'Poor fellow!--he has good counsel?\'\'The best--Caius Pollio, an eloquent fellow enough.  Pollio has beenhiring all the poor gentlemen and well-born spendthrifts of Pompeii todress shabbily and sneak about, swearing their friendship to Glaucus(who would not have spoken to them to be made emperor!--I will do himjustice, he was a gentleman in his choice of acquaintance), and tryingto melt the stony citizens into pity.  But it will not do; Isis ismightily popular just at this moment.\'\'And, by-the-by, I have some merchandise at Alexandria.  Yes, Isis oughtto be protected.\'\'True; so farewell, old gentleman: we shall meet soon; if not, we musthave a friendly bet at the Amphitheatre.  All my calculations areconfounded by this cursed misfortune of Glaucus!  He had bet on Lydonthe gladiator; I must make up my tablets elsewhere.  Vale!\'Leaving the less active Diomed to regain his villa, Clodius strode on,humming a Greek air, and perfuming the night with the odours thatsteamed from his snowy garments and flowing locks.\'If,\' thought he, \'Glaucus feed the lion, Julia will no longer have aperson to love better than me; she will certainly doat on me--and so, Isuppose, I must marry.  By the gods! the twelve lines begin to fail--menlook suspiciously at my hand when it rattles the dice. That infernalSallust insinuates cheating; and if it be discovered that the ivory isclogged, why farewell to the merry supper and the perfumedbillet--Clodius is undone! Better marry, then, while I may, renouncegaming, and push my fortune (or rather the gentle Julia\'s) at theimperial court.\'Thus muttering the schemes of his ambition, if by that high name theprojects of Clodius may be called, the gamester found himself suddenlyaccosted; he turned and beheld the dark brow of Arbaces.\'Hail, noble Clodius! pardon my interruption; and inform me, I pray you,which is the house of Sallust?\'\'It is but a few yards hence, wise Arbaces.  But does Sallust entertainto-night?\'\'I know not,\' answered the Egyptian; \'nor am I, perhaps, one of thosewhom he would seek as a boon companion.  But thou knowest that his households the person of Glaucus, the murderer.\'\'Ay! he, good-hearted epicure, believes in the Greek\'s innocence!  Youremind me that he has become his surety; and, therefore, till the trial,is responsible for his appearance. Well, Sallust\'s house is better thana prison, especially that wretched hole in the forum.  But for what canyou seek Glaucus?\'\'Why, noble Clodius, if we could save him from execution it would bewell. The condemnation of the rich is a blow upon society itself.  Ishould like to confer with him--for I hear he has recovered hissenses--and ascertain the motives of his crime; they may be soextenuating as to plead in his defence.\'\'You are benevolent, Arbaces.\'\'Benevolence is the duty of one who aspires to wisdom,\' replied theEgyptian, modestly.  \'Which way lies Sallust\'s mansion?\'\'I will show you,\' said Clodius, \'if you will suffer me to accompany youa few steps.  But, pray what has become of the poor girl who was to havewed the Athenian--the sister of the murdered priest?\'\'Alas! well-nigh insane!  Sometimes she utters imprecations on themurderer--then suddenly stops short--then cries, ""But why curse? Oh, mybrother! Glaucus was not thy murderer--never will I believe it!"" Thenshe begins again, and again stops short, and mutters awfully to herself,""Yet if it were indeed he?""\'\'Unfortunate Ione!\'\'But it is well for her that those solemn cares to the dead whichreligion enjoins have hitherto greatly absorbed her attention fromGlaucus and herself: and, in the dimness of her senses, she scarcelyseems aware that Glaucus is apprehended and on the eve of trial.  Whenthe funeral rites due to Apaecides are performed, her apprehension willreturn; and then I fear me much that her friends will be revolted byseeing her run to succour and aid the murderer of her brother!\'\'Such scandal should be prevented.\'\'I trust I have taken precautions to that effect.  I am her lawfulguardian, and have just succeeded in obtaining permission to escort her,after the funeral of Apaecides, to my own house; there, please the gods!she will be secure.\'\'You have done well, sage Arbaces.  And, now, yonder is the house ofSallust.  The gods keep you!  Yet, hark you, Arbaces--why so gloomy andunsocial?  Men say you can be gay--why not let me initiate you into thepleasures of Pompeii?--I flatter myself no one knows them better.\'\'I thank you, noble Clodius: under your auspices I might venture, Ithink, to wear the philyra: but, at my age, I should be an awkwardpupil.\'\'Oh, never fear; I have made converts of fellows of seventy.  The rich,too, are never old.\'\'You flatter me.  At some future time I will remind you of yourpromise.\'\'You may command Marcus Clodius at all times--and so, vale!\'\'Now,\' said the Egyptian, soliloquising, \'I am not wantonly a man ofblood; I would willingly save this Greek, if, by confessing the crime,he will lose himself for ever to Ione, and for ever free me from thechance of discovery; and I can save him by persuading Julia to own thephiltre, which will be held his excuse.  But if he do not confess thecrime, why, Julia must be shamed from the confession, and he mustdie!--die, lest he prove my rival with the living--die, that he may bemy proxy with the dead!  Will he confess?--can he not be persuaded thatin his delirium he struck the blow? To me it would give far greatersafety than even his death.  Hem! we must hazard the experiment.\'Sweeping along the narrow street, Arbaces now approached the house ofSallust, when he beheld a dark form wrapped in a cloak, and stretched atlength across the threshold of the door.So still lay the figure, and so dim was its outline, that any other thanArbaces might have felt a superstitious fear, lest he beheld one ofthose grim lemures, who, above all other spots, haunted the threshold ofthe homes they formerly possessed.  But not for Arbaces were suchdreams.\'Rise!\' said he, touching the figure with his foot; \'thou obstructestthe way!\'\'Ha! who art thou,\' cried the form, in a sharp tone, and as she raisedherself from the ground, the starlight fell full on the pale face andfixed but sightless eyes of Nydia the Thessalian.  \'Who art thou?  Iknow the burden of thy voice.\'\'Blind girl! what dost thou here at this late hour?  Fie!--is thisseeming thy sex or years?  Home, girl!\'\'I know thee,\' said Nydia, in a low voice, \'thou art Arbaces theEgyptian\': then, as if inspired by some sudden impulse, she flungherself at his feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed, in a wild andpassionate tone, \'Oh dread and potent man! save him--save him! He is notguilty--it is I!  He lies within, ill-dying, and I--I am the hatefulcause!  And they will not admit me to him--they spurn the blind girlfrom the hall.  Oh, heal him! thou knowest some herb--some spell--somecountercharm, for it is a potion that hath wrought this frenzy!\'\'Hush, child!  I know all!--thou forgettest that I accompanied Julia tothe saga\'s home.  Doubtless her hand administered the draught; but herreputation demands thy silence.  Reproach not thyself--what must be,must: meanwhile, I seek the criminal--he may yet be saved. Away!\'Thus saying, Arbaces extricated himself from the clasp of the despairingThessalian, and knocked loudly at the door.In a few moments the heavy bars were heard suddenly to yield, and theporter, half opening the door, demanded who was there.\'Arbaces--important business to Sallust relative to Glaucus.  I comefrom the praetor.\'The porter, half yawning, half groaning, admitted the tall form of theEgyptian.  Nydia sprang forward.  \'How is he?\' she cried; \'tell me--tellme!\'\'Ho, mad girl! is it thou still?--for shame!  Why, they say he issensible.\'\'The gods be praised!--and you will not admit me?  Ah! I beseechthee...\'\'Admit thee!--no.  A pretty salute I should prepare for these shoulderswere I to admit such things as thou!  Go home!\'The door closed, and Nydia, with a deep sigh, laid herself down oncemore on the cold stones; and, wrapping her cloak round her face, resumedher weary vigil.Meanwhile Arbaces had already gained the triclinium, where Sallust, withhis favorite freedman, sat late at supper.\'What!  Arbaces! and at this hour!--Accept this cup.\'\'Nay, gentle Sallust; it is on business, not pleasure, that I venture todisturb thee.  How doth thy charge?--they say in the town that he hasrecovered sense.\'\'Alas! and truly,\' replied the good-natured but thoughtless Sallust,wiping the tear from his eyes; \'but so shattered are his nerves andframe that I scarcely recognize the brilliant and gay carouser I waswont to know.  Yet, strange to say, he cannot account for the cause ofthe sudden frenzy that seized him--he retains but a dim consciousness ofwhat hath passed; and, despite thy witness, wise Egyptian, solemnlyupholds his innocence of the death of Apaecides.\'\'Sallust,\' said Arbaces, gravely, \'there is much in thy friend\'s casethat merits a peculiar indulgence; and could we learn from his lips theconfession and the cause of his crime, much might be yet hoped from themercy of the senate; for the senate, thou knowest, hath the power eitherto mitigate or to sharpen the law.  Therefore it is that I haveconferred with the highest authority of the city, and obtained hispermission to hold a private conference this night with the Athenian.Tomorrow, thou knowest, the trial comes on.\'\'Well,\' said Sallust, \'thou wilt be worthy of thy Eastern name and fameif thou canst learn aught from him; but thou mayst try.  PoorGlaucus!--and he had such an excellent appetite!  He eats nothing now!\'The benevolent epicure was moved sensibly at this thought.  He sighed,and ordered his slaves to refill his cup.\'Night wanes,\' said the Egyptian; \'suffer me to see thy ward now.\'Sallust nodded assent, and led the way to a small chamber, guardedwithout by two dozing slaves.  The door opened; at the request ofArbaces, Sallust withdrew--the Egyptian was alone with Glaucus.One of those tall and graceful candelabra common to that day, supportinga single lamp, burned beside the narrow bed.  Its rays fell palely overthe face of the Athenian, and Arbaces was moved to see how sensibly thatcountenance had changed.  The rich color was gone, the cheek was sunk,the lips were convulsed and pallid; fierce had been the struggle betweenreason and madness, life and death. The youth, the strength of Glaucushad conquered; but the freshness of blood and soul--the life oflife--its glory and its zest, were gone for ever.The Egyptian seated himself quietly beside the bed; Glaucus still laymute and unconscious of his presence.  At length, after a considerablepause, Arbaces thus spoke:\'Glaucus, we have been enemies.  I come to thee alone and in the dead ofnight--thy friend, perhaps thy saviour.\'As the steed starts from the path of the tiger, Glaucus sprang upbreathless--alarmed, panting at the abrupt voice, the sudden apparitionof his foe.  Their eyes met, and neither, for some moments, had power towithdraw his gaze.  The flush went and came over the face of theAthenian, and the bronzed cheek of the Egyptian grew a shade more pale.At length, with an inward groan, Glaucus turned away, drew his handacross his brow, sunk back, and muttered:\'Am I still dreaming?\'\'No, Glaucus thou art awake.  By this right hand and my father\'s head,thou seest one who may save thy life.  Hark! I know what thou hast done,but I know also its excuse, of which thou thyself art ignorant.  Thouhast committed murder, it is true--a sacrilegious murder--frownnot--start not--these eyes saw it.  But I can save thee--I can prove howthou wert bereaved of sense, and made not a free-thinking andfree-acting man.  But in order to save thee, thou must confess thy crime.Sign but this paper, acknowledging thy hand in the death of Apaecides,and thou shalt avoid the fatal urn.\'\'What words are these?--Murder and Apaecides!--Did I not see himstretched on the ground bleeding and a corpse? and wouldst thou persuademe that I did the deed?  Man, thou liest!  Away!\'\'Be not rash--Glaucus, be not hasty; the deed is proved.  Come, come,thou mayst well be excused for not recalling the act of thy delirium,and which thy sober senses would have shunned even to contemplate.  Butlet me try to refresh thy exhausted and weary memory. Thou knowest thouwert walking with the priest, disputing about his sister; thou knowesthe was intolerant, and half a Nazarene, and he sought to convert thee,and ye had hot words; and he calumniated thy mode of life, and swore hewould not marry Ione to thee--and then, in thy wrath and thy frenzy,thou didst strike the sudden blow. Come, come; you can recollectthis!--read this papyrus, it runs to that effect--sign it, and thouart saved.\'\'Barbarian, give me the written lie, that I may tear it!  I the murdererof Ione\'s brother: I confess to have injured one hair of the head of himshe loved!  Let me rather perish a thousand times!\'\'Beware!\' said Arbaces, in a low and hissing tone; \'there is but onechoice--thy confession and thy signature, or the amphitheatre and thelion\'s maw!\'As the Egyptian fixed his eyes upon the sufferer, he hailed with joy thesigns of evident emotion that seized the latter at these words.  Aslight shudder passed over the Athenian\'s frame--his lip fell--anexpression of sudden fear and wonder betrayed itself in his brow andeye.\'Great gods!\' he said, in a low voice, \'what reverse is this?  It seemsbut a little day since life laughed out from amidst roses--Ionemine--youth, health, love, lavishing on me their treasures; andnow--pain, madness, shame, death!  And for what?  What have I done?Oh, I am mad still?\'\'Sign, and be saved!\' said the soft, sweet voice of the Egyptian.\'Tempter, never!\' cried Glaucus, in the reaction of rage.  \'Thou knowestme not: thou knowest not the haughty soul of an Athenian! The suddenface of death might appal me for a moment, but the fear is over.Dishonour appals for ever!  Who will debase his name to save his life?who exchange clear thoughts for sullen days? who will belie himself toshame, and stand blackened in the eyes of love?  If to earn a few yearsof polluted life there be so base a coward, dream not, dull barbarian ofEgypt! to find him in one who has trod the same sod as Harmodius, andbreathed the same air as Socrates.  Go! leave me to live withoutself-reproach--or to perish without fear!\'\'Bethink thee well! the lion\'s fangs: the hoots of the brutal mob: thevulgar gaze on thy dying agony and mutilated limbs: thy name degraded;thy corpse unburied; the shame thou wouldst avoid clinging to thee foraye and ever!\'\'Thou ravest; thou art the madman! shame is not in the loss of othermen\'s esteem--it is in the loss of our own.  Wilt thou go?--my eyesloathe the sight of thee! hating ever, I despise thee now!\'\'I go,\' said Arbaces, stung and exasperated, but not without somepitying admiration of his victim, \'I go; we meet twice again--once atthe Trial, once at the Death!  Farewell!\'The Egyptian rose slowly, gathered his robes about him, and left thechamber.  He sought Sallust for a moment, whose eyes began to reel withthe vigils of the cup: \'He is still unconscious, or still obstinate;there is no hope for him.\'\'Say not so,\' replied Sallust, who felt but little resentment againstthe Athenian\'s accuser, for he possessed no great austerity of virtue,and was rather moved by his friend\'s reverses than persuaded of hisinnocence--\'say not so, my Egyptian! so good a drinker shall be saved ifpossible.  Bacchus against Isis!\'\'We shall see,\' said the Egyptian.Suddenly the bolts were again withdrawn--the door unclosed; Arbaces wasin the open street; and poor Nydia once more started from her longwatch.\'Wilt thou save him?\' she cried, clasping her hands.\'Child, follow me home; I would speak to thee--it is for his sake I askit.\'\'And thou wilt save him?\'No answer came forth to the thirsting ear of the blind girl: Arbaces hadalready proceeded far up the street; she hesitated a moment, and thenfollowed his steps in silence.\'I must secure this girl,\' said he, musingly, \'lest she give evidence ofthe philtre; as to the vain Julia, she will not betray herself.\'Chapter VIIIA CLASSIC FUNERAL.WHILE Arbaces had been thus employed, Sorrow and Death were in the houseof Ione.  It was the night preceding the morn in which the solemnfuneral rites were to be decreed to the remains of the murderedApaecides.  The corpse had been removed from the temple of Isis to thehouse of the nearest surviving relative, and Ione had heard, in the samebreath, the death of her brother and the accusation against herbetrothed.  That first violent anguish which blunts the sense to all butitself, and the forbearing silence of her slaves, had prevented herlearning minutely the circumstances attendant on the fate of her lover.His illness, his frenzy, and his approaching trial, were unknown to her.She learned only the accusation against him, and at once indignantlyrejected it; nay, on hearing that Arbaces was the accuser, she requiredno more to induce her firmly and solemnly to believe that the Egyptianhimself was the criminal.  But the vast and absorbing importanceattached by the ancients to the performance of every ceremonialconnected with the death of a relation, had, as yet, confined her woeand her convictions to the chamber of the deceased.  Alas! it was notfor her to perform that tender and touching office, which obliged thenearest relative to endeavor to catch the last breath--the partingsoul--of the beloved one: but it was hers to close the straining eyes,the distorted lips: to watch by the consecrated clay, as, fresh bathedand anointed, it lay in festive robes upon the ivory bed; to strew thecouch with leaves and flowers, and to renew the solemn cypress-branch atthe threshold of the door.  And in these sad offices, in lamentation andin prayer, Ione forgot herself.  It was among the loveliest customs ofthe ancients to bury the young at the morning twilight; for, as theystrove to give the softest interpretation to death, so they poeticallyimagined that Aurora, who loved the young, had stolen them to herembrace; and though in the instance of the murdered priest this fablecould not appropriately cheat the fancy, the general custom was stillpreserved.The stars were fading one by one from the grey heavens, and night slowlyreceding before the approach of morn, when a dark group stood motionlessbefore Ione\'s door.  High and slender torches, made paler by theunmellowed dawn, cast their light over various countenances, hushed forthe moment in one solemn and intent expression.  And now there arose aslow and dismal music, which accorded sadly with the rite, and floatedfar along the desolate and breathless streets; while a chorus of femalevoices (the Praeficae so often cited by the Roman poets), accompanyingthe Tibicen and the Mysian flute, woke the following strain:               THE FUNERAL DIRGE      O\'er the sad threshold, where the cypress bough         Supplants the rose that should adorn thy home,       On the last pilgrimage on earth that now         Awaits thee, wanderer to Cocytus, come!       Darkly we woo, and weeping we invite--        Death is thy host--his banquet asks thy soul,       Thy garlands hang within the House of Night,         And the black stream alone shall fill thy bowl.      No more for thee the laughter and the song,         The jocund night--the glory of the day!       The Argive daughters\' at their labours long;         The hell-bird swooping on its Titan prey--      The false AEolides upheaving slow,         O\'er the eternal hill, the eternal stone;       The crowned Lydian, in his parching woe,         And green Callirrhoe\'s monster-headed son--      These shalt thou see, dim shadowed through the dark,         Which makes the sky of Pluto\'s dreary shore;       Lo! where thou stand\'st, pale-gazing on the bark,          That waits our rite to bear thee trembling o\'er!       Come, then! no more delay!--the phantom pines         Amidst the Unburied for its latest home;       O\'er the grey sky the torch impatient shines--        Come, mourner, forth!--the lost one bids thee come.As the hymn died away, the group parted in twain; and placed upon acouch, spread with a purple pall, the corpse of Apaecides was carriedforth, with the feet foremost.  The designator, or marshal of the sombreceremonial, accompanied by his torch-bearers, clad in black, gave thesignal, and the procession moved dreadly on.First went the musicians, playing a slow march--the solemnity of thelower instruments broken by many a louder and wilder burst of thefuneral trumpet: next followed the hired mourners, chanting their dirgesto the dead; and the female voices were mingled with those of boys,whose tender years made still more striking the contrast of life anddeath--the fresh leaf and the withered one.  But the players, thebuffoons, the archimimus (whose duty it was to personate thedead)--these, the customary attendants at ordinary funerals, werebanished from a funeral attended with so many terrible associations.The priests of Isis came next in their snowy garments, barefooted, andsupporting sheaves of corn; while before the corpse were carried theimages of the deceased and his many Athenian forefathers.  And behindthe bier followed, amidst her women, the sole surviving relative of thedead--her head bare, her locks disheveled, her face paler than marble,but composed and still, save ever and anon, as some tenderthought--awakened by the music, flashed upon the dark lethargy of woe,she covered that countenance with her hands, and sobbed unseen; for herswere not the noisy sorrow, the shrill lament, the ungoverned gesture,which characterized those who honored less faithfully.  In that age, asin all, the channel of deep grief flowed hushed and still.And so the procession swept on, till it had traversed the streets,passed the city gate, and gained the Place of Tombs without the wall,which the traveler yet beholds.Raised in the form of an altar--of unpolished pine, amidst whoseinterstices were placed preparations of combustible matter--stood thefuneral pyre; and around it drooped the dark and gloomy cypresses soconsecrated by song to the tomb.As soon as the bier was placed upon the pile, the attendants parting oneither side, Ione passed up to the couch, and stood before theunconscious clay for some moments motionless and silent. The features ofthe dead had been composed from the first agonized expression of violentdeath.  Hushed for ever the terror and the doubt, the contest ofpassion, the awe of religion, the struggle of the past and present, thehope and the horror of the future!--of all that racked and desolated thebreast of that young aspirant to the Holy of Life, what trace wasvisible in the awful serenity of that impenetrable brow and unbreathinglip?  The sister gazed, and not a sound was heard amidst the crowd;there was something terrible, yet softening, also, in the silence; andwhen it broke, it broke sudden and abrupt--it broke, with a loud andpassionate cry--the vent of long-smothered despair.\'My brother! my brother!\' cried the poor orphan, falling upon the couch;\'thou whom the worm on thy path feared not--what enemy couldst thouprovoke? Oh, is it in truth come to this?  Awake! awake! We grewtogether!  Are we thus torn asunder?  Thou art not dead--thou sleepest.Awake! awake!\'The sound of her piercing voice aroused the sympathy of the mourners,and they broke into loud and rude lament.  This startled, this recalledIone; she looked up hastily and confusedly, as if for the first timesensible of the presence of those around.\'Ah!\' she murmured with a shiver, \'we are not then alone!\' With that,after a brief pause, she rose; and her pale and beautiful countenancewas again composed and rigid.  With fond and trembling hands, sheunclosed the lids of the deceased; but when the dull glazed eye, nolonger beaming with love and life, met hers, she shrieked aloud, as ifshe had seen a spectre.  Once more recovering herself she kissed againand again the lids, the lips, the brow; and with mechanic andunconscious hand, received from the high priest of her brother\'s templethe funeral torch.The sudden burst of music, the sudden song of the mourners announced thebirth of the sanctifying flame.           HYMN TO THE WIND                I       On thy couch of cloud reclined,        Wake, O soft and sacred Wind!        Soft and sacred will we name thee,        Whosoe\'er the sire that claim thee--       Whether old Auster\'s dusky child,        Or the loud son of Eurus wild;        Or his who o\'er the darkling deeps,        From the bleak North, in tempest sweeps;        Still shalt thou seem as dear to us        As flowery-crowned Zephyrus,        When, through twilight\'s starry dew,        Trembling, he hastes his nymph to woo.                II       Lo! our silver censers swinging,        Perfumes o\'er thy path are flinging--       Ne\'er o\'er Tempe\'s breathless valleys,        Ne\'er o\'er Cypria\'s cedarn alleys,        Or the Rose-isle\'s moonlit sea,        Floated sweets more worthy thee.        Lo! around our vases sending        Myrrh and nard with cassia blending:        Paving air with odorous meet,        For thy silver-sandall\'d feet!               III       August and everlasting air!          The source of all that breathe and be,        From the mute clay before thee bear          The seeds it took from thee!        Aspire, bright Flame! aspire!          Wild wind!--awake, awake!        Thine own, O solemn Fire!          O Air, thine own retake!                IV       It comes! it comes! Lo! it sweeps,          The Wind we invoke the while!        And crackles, and darts, and leaps          The light on the holy pile!        It rises! its wings interweave        With the flames--how they howl and heave!            Toss\'d, whirl\'d to and fro,            How the flame-serpents glow!            Rushing higher and higher,            On--on, fearful Fire!            Thy giant limbs twined            With the arms of the Wind!        Lo! the elements meet on the throne        Of death--to reclaim their own!                 V       Swing, swing the censer round--       Tune the strings to a softer sound!        From the chains of thy earthly toil,        From the clasp of thy mortal coil,        From the prison where clay confined thee,        The hands of the flame unbind thee!            O Soul! thou art free--all free!        As the winds in their ceaseless chase,          When they rush o\'er their airy sea,        Thou mayst speed through the realms of space,          No fetter is forged for thee!        Rejoice! o\'er the sluggard tide        Of the Styx thy bark can glide,        And thy steps evermore shall rove        Through the glades of the happy grove;        Where, far from the loath\'d Cocytus,        The loved and the lost invite us.        Thou art slave to the earth no more!          O soul, thou art freed!--and we?--       Ah! when shall our toil be o\'er?          Ah! when shall we rest with thee?And now high and far into the dawning skies broke the fragrant fire; itflushed luminously across the gloomy cypresses--it shot above themassive walls of the neighboring city; and the early fisherman startedto behold the blaze reddening on the waves of the creeping sea.But Ione sat down apart and alone, and, leaning her face upon her hands,saw not the flame, nor heard the lamentation of the music: she felt onlyone sense of loneliness--she had not yet arrived to that hallowing senseof comfort, when we know that we are not alone--that the dead are withus!The breeze rapidly aided the effect of the combustibles placed withinthe pile.  By degrees the flame wavered, lowered, dimmed, and slowly, byfits and unequal starts, died away--emblem of life itself; where, justbefore, all was restlessness and flame, now lay the dull and smoulderingashes.The last sparks were extinguished by the attendants--the embers werecollected.  Steeped in the rarest wine and the costliest odorous, theremains were placed in a silver urn, which was solemnly stored in one ofthe neighboring sepulchres beside the road; and they placed within itthe vial full of tears, and the small coin which poetry stillconsecrated to the grim boatman.  And the sepulchre was covered withflowers and chaplets, and incense kindled on the altar, and the tombhung round with many lamps.But the next day, when the priest returned with fresh offerings to thetomb, he found that to the relics of heathen superstition some unknownhands had added a green palm-branch.  He suffered it to remain,unknowing that it was the sepulchral emblem of Christianity.When the above ceremonies were over, one of the Praeficae three timessprinkled the mourners from the purifying branch of laurel, uttering thelast word, \'Ilicet!\'--Depart!--and the rite was done.But first they paused to utter--weepingly and many times--the affectingfarewell, \'Salve Eternum!\' And as Ione yet lingered, they woke theparting strain.            SALVE ETERNUM                 I       Farewell! O soul departed!          Farewell! O sacred urn!        Bereaved and broken-hearted,          To earth the mourners turn.        To the dim and dreary shore,        Thou art gone our steps before!        But thither the swift Hours lead us,        And thou dost but a while precede us,                  Salve--salve!        Loved urn, and thou solemn cell,        Mute ashes!--farewell, farewell!                  Salve--salve!                II         Ilicet--ire licet--       Ah, vainly would we part!        Thy tomb is the faithful heart.        About evermore we bear thee;        For who from the heart can tear thee?        Vainly we sprinkle o\'er us          The drops of the cleansing stream;        And vainly bright before us          The lustral fire shall beam.        For where is the charm expelling        Thy thought from its sacred dwelling?        Our griefs are thy funeral feast,        And Memory thy mourning priest.                  Salve--salve!                III         Ilicet--ire licet!        The spark from the hearth is gone          Wherever the air shall bear it;        The elements take their own--         The shadows receive thy spirit.        It will soothe thee to feel our grief,          As thou glid\'st by the Gloomy River!        If love may in life be brief,          In death it is fixed for ever.                  Salve--salve!        In the hall which our feasts illume,        The rose for an hour may bloom;        But the cypress that decks the tomb--       The cypress is green for ever!                  Salve--salve!Chapter IXIN WHICH AN ADVENTURE HAPPENS TO IONE.WHILE some stayed behind to share with the priests the funeral banquet,Ione and her handmaids took homeward their melancholy way. And now (thelast duties to her brother performed) her mind awoke from itsabsorption, and she thought of her allianced, and the dread chargeagainst him.  Not--as we have before said--attaching even a momentarybelief to the unnatural accusation, but nursing the darkest suspicionagainst Arbaces, she felt that justice to her lover and to her murderedrelative demanded her to seek the praetor, and communicate herimpression, unsupported as it might be.  Questioning her maidens, whohad hitherto--kindly anxious, as I have said, to save her the additionalagony--refrained from informing her of the state of Glaucus, she learnedthat he had been dangerously ill: that he was in custody, under the roofof Sallust; that the day of his trial was appointed.\'Averting gods,\' she exclaimed; \'and have I been so long forgetful ofhim? Have I seemed to shun him?  O! let me hasten to do him justice--toshow that I, the nearest relative of the dead, believe him innocent ofthe charge. Quick! quick! let us fly.  Let me soothe--tend--cheer him!and if they will not believe me; if they will not lead to my conviction;if they sentence him to exile or to death, let me share the sentencewith him!\'Instinctively she hastened her pace, confused and bewildered, scarceknowing whither she went; now designing first to seek the praetor, andnow to rush to the chamber of Glaucus.  She hurried on--she passed thegate of the city--she was in the long street leading up the town.  Thehouses were opened, but none were yet astir in the streets; the life ofthe city was scarce awake--when lo! she came suddenly upon a small knotof men standing beside a covered litter. A tall figure stepped from themidst of them, and Ione shrieked aloud to behold Arbaces.\'Fair Ione!\' said he, gently, and appearing not to heed her alarm: \'myward, my pupil! forgive me if I disturb thy pious sorrows; but thepraetor, solicitous of thy honour, and anxious that thou mayest notrashly be implicated in the coming trial; knowing the strangeembarrassment of thy state (seeking justice for thy brother, butdreading punishment to thy betrothed)--sympathizing, too, with thyunprotected and friendless condition, and deeming it harsh that thoushouldst be suffered to act unguided and mourn alone--hath wisely andpaternally confided thee to the care of thy lawful guardian. Behold thewriting which intrusts thee to my charge!\'\'Dark Egyptian!\' cried Ione, drawing herself proudly aside; \'begone!  Itis thou that hast slain my brother!  Is it to thy care, thy hands yetreeking with his blood, that they will give the sister Ha! thou turnestpale! thy conscience smites thee! thou tremblest at the thunderbolt ofthe avenging god!  Pass on, and leave me to my woe!\'\'Thy sorrows unstring thy reason, Ione,\' said Arbaces, attempting invain his usual calmness of tone.  \'I forgive thee.  Thou wilt find menow, as ever, thy surest friend.  But the public streets are not thefitting place for us to confer--for me to console thee. Approach,slaves!  Come, my sweet charge, the litter awaits thee.\'The amazed and terrified attendants gathered round Ione, and clung toher knees.\'Arbaces,\' said the eldest of the maidens, \'this is surely not the law!For nine days after the funeral, is it not written that the relatives ofthe deceased shall not be molested in their homes, or interrupted intheir solitary grief?\'\'Woman!\' returned Arbaces, imperiously waving his hand, \'to place a wardunder the roof of her guardian is not against the funeral laws.  I tellthee I have the fiat of the praetor.  This delay is indecorous.  Placeher in the litter.\'So saying, he threw his arm firmly round the shrinking form of Ione.She drew back, gazed earnestly in his face, and then burst intohysterical laughter:\'Ha, ha! this is well--well!  Excellent guardian--paternal law!  Ha,ha!\' And, startled herself at the dread echo of that shrill and maddenedlaughter, she sunk, as it died away, lifeless upon the ground...  Aminute more, and Arbaces had lifted her into the litter. The bearersmoved swiftly on, and the unfortunate Ione was soon borne from the sightof her weeping handmaids.Chapter XWHAT BECOMES OF NYDIA IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES.  THE EGYPTIAN FEELSCOMPASSION FOR GLAUCUS.  COMPASSION IS OFTEN A VERY USELESS VISITOR TOTHE GUILTY.IT will be remembered that, at the command of Arbaces, Nydia followedthe Egyptian to his home, and conversing there with her, he learned fromthe confession of her despair and remorse, that her hand, and notJulia\'s, had administered to Glaucus the fatal potion.  At another timethe Egyptian might have conceived a philosophical interest in soundingthe depths and origin of the strange and absorbing passion which, inblindness and in slavery, this singular girl had dared to cherish; butat present he spared no thought from himself.  As, after her confession,the poor Nydia threw herself on her knees before him, and besought himto restore the health and save the life of Glaucus--for in her youth andignorance she imagined the dark magician all-powerful to effectboth--Arbaces, with unheeding ears, was noting only the new expediency ofdetaining Nydia a prisoner until the trial and fate of Glaucus weredecided.  For if, when he judged her merely the accomplice of Julia inobtaining the philtre, he had felt it was dangerous to the full successof his vengeance to allow her to be at large--to appear, perhaps, as awitness--to avow the manner in which the sense of Glaucus had beendarkened, and thus win indulgence to the crime of which he wasaccused--how much more was she likely to volunteer her testimony whenshe herself had administered the draught, and, inspired by love, wouldbe only anxious, at any expense of shame, to retrieve her error andpreserve her beloved?  Besides, how unworthy of the rank and repute ofArbaces to be implicated in the disgrace of pandering to the passion ofJulia, and assisting in the unholy rites of the Saga of Vesuvius!Nothing less, indeed, than his desire to induce Glaucus to own themurder of Apaecides, as a policy evidently the best both for his ownpermanent safety and his successful suit with Ione, could ever have ledhim to contemplate the confession of Julia.As for Nydia, who was necessarily cut off by her blindness from much ofthe knowledge of active life, and who, a slave and a stranger, wasnaturally ignorant of the perils of the Roman law, she thought rather ofthe illness and delirium of her Athenian, than the crime of which shehad vaguely heard him accused, or the chances of the impending trial.Poor wretch that she was, whom none addressed, none cared for, what didshe know of the senate and the sentence--the hazard of the law--theferocity of the people--the arena and the lion\'s den?  She wasaccustomed only to associate with the thought of Glaucus everything thatwas prosperous and lofty--she could not imagine that any peril, savefrom the madness of her love, could menace that sacred head.  He seemedto her set apart for the blessings of life.  She only had disturbed thecurrent of his felicity; she knew not, she dreamed not that the stream,once so bright, was dashing on to darkness and to death.  It wastherefore to restore the brain that she had marred, to save the lifethat she had endangered that she implored the assistance of the greatEgyptian.\'Daughter,\' said Arbaces, waking from his reverie, \'thou must rest here;it is not meet for thee to wander along the streets, and be spurned fromthe threshold by the rude feet of slaves.  I have compassion on thy softcrime--I will do all to remedy it.  Wait here patiently for some days,and Glaucus shall be restored.\' So saying, and without waiting for herreply, he hastened from the room, drew the bolt across the door, andconsigned the care and wants of his prisoner to the slave who had thecharge of that part of the mansion.Alone, then, and musingly, he waited the morning light, and with itrepaired, as we have seen, to possess himself of the person of Ione.His primary object, with respect to the unfortunate Neapolitan, was thatwhich he had really stated to Clodius, viz., to prevent her interestingherself actively in the trial of Glaucus, and also to guard against heraccusing him (which she would, doubtless, have done) of his former actof perfidy and violence towards her, his ward--denouncing his causes forvengeance against Glaucus--unveiling the hypocrisy of his character--andcasting any doubt upon his veracity in the charge which he had madeagainst the Athenian.  Not till he had encountered her that morning--nottill he had heard her loud denunciations--was he aware that he had alsoanother danger to apprehend in her suspicion of his crime.  He huggedhimself now at the thought that these ends were effected: that one, atonce the object of his passion and his fear, was in his power.  Hebelieved more than ever the flattering promises of the stars; and whenhe sought Ione in that chamber in the inmost recesses of his mysteriousmansion to which he had consigned her--when he found her overpowered byblow upon blow, and passing from fit to fit, from violence to torpor, inall the alternations of hysterical disease--he thought more of theloveliness which no frenzy could distort than of the woe which he hadbrought upon her.  In that sanguine vanity common to men who throughlife have been invariably successful, whether in fortune or love, heflattered himself that when Glaucus had perished--when his name wassolemnly blackened by the award of a legal judgment, his title to herlove for ever forfeited by condemnation to death for the murder of herown brother--her affection would be changed to horror; and that histenderness and his passion, assisted by all the arts with which he wellknew how to dazzle woman\'s imagination, might elect him to that thronein her heart from which his rival would be so awfully expelled.  Thiswas his hope: but should it fail, his unholy and fervid passionwhispered, \'At the worst, now she is in my power.\'Yet, withal, he felt that uneasiness and apprehension which attendedupon the chance of detection, even when the criminal is insensible tothe voice of conscience--that vague terror of the consequences of crime,which is often mistaken for remorse at the crime itself.  The buoyantair of Campania weighed heavily upon his breast; he longed to hurry froma scene where danger might not sleep eternally with the dead; and,having Ione now in his possession, he secretly resolved, as soon as hehad witnessed the last agony of his rival, to transport his wealth--andher, the costliest treasure of all, to some distant shore.\'Yes,\' said he, striding to and fro his solitary chamber--\'yes, the lawthat gave me the person of my ward gives me the possession of my bride.Far across the broad main will we sweep on our search after novelluxuries and inexperienced pleasures.  Cheered by my stars, supported bythe omens of my soul, we will penetrate to those vast and gloriousworlds which my wisdom tells me lie yet untracked in the recesses of thecircling sea.  There may this heart, possessed of love, grow once morealive to ambition--there, amongst nations uncrushed by the Roman yoke,and to whose ear the name of Rome has not yet been wafted, I may foundan empire, and transplant my ancestral creed; renewing the ashes of thedead Theban rule; continuing in yet grander shores the dynasty of mycrowned fathers, and waking in the noble heart of Ione the gratefulconsciousness that she shares the lot of one who, far from the agedrottenness of this slavish civilization, restores the primal elements ofgreatness, and unites in one mighty soul the attributes of the prophetand the king.\' From this exultant soliloquy, Arbaces was awakened toattend the trial of the Athenian.The worn and pallid cheek of his victim touched him less than thefirmness of his nerves and the dauntlessness of his brow; for Arbaceswas one who had little pity for what was unfortunate, but a strongsympathy for what was bold.  The congenialities that bind us to othersever assimilate to the qualities of our own nature.  The hero weeps lessat the reverses of his enemy than at the fortitude with which he bearsthem.  All of us are human, and Arbaces, criminal as he was, had hisshare of our common feelings and our mother clay. Had he but obtainedfrom Glaucus the written confession of his crime, which would, betterthan even the judgment of others, have lost him with Ione, and removedfrom Arbaces the chance of future detection, the Egyptian would havestrained every nerve to save his rival.  Even now his hatred wasover--his desire of revenge was slaked: he crushed his prey, not inenmity, but as an obstacle in his path. Yet was he not the lessresolved, the less crafty and persevering, in the course he pursued, forthe destruction of one whose doom was become necessary to the attainmentof his objects: and while, with apparent reluctance and compassion, hegave against Glaucus the evidence which condemned him, he secretly, andthrough the medium of the priesthood, fomented that popular indignationwhich made an effectual obstacle to the pity of the senate.  He hadsought Julia; he had detailed to her the confession of Nydia; he hadeasily, therefore, lulled any scruple of conscience which might have ledher to extenuate the offence of Glaucus by avowing her share in hisfrenzy: and the more readily, for her vain heart had loved the fame andthe prosperity of Glaucus--not Glaucus himself, she felt no affectionfor a disgraced man--nay, she almost rejoiced in the disgrace thathumbled the hated Ione.  If Glaucus could not be her slave, neithercould he be the adorer of her rival.  This was sufficient consolationfor any regret at his fate.  Volatile and fickle, she began again to bemoved by the sudden and earnest suit of Clodius, and was not willing tohazard the loss of an alliance with that base but high-born noble by anypublic exposure of her past weakness and immodest passion for another.All things then smiled upon Arbaces--all things frowned upon theAthenian.Chapter XINYDIA AFFECTS THE SORCERESS.WHEN the Thessalian found that Arbaces returned to her no more--when shewas left, hour after hour, to all the torture of that miserable suspensewhich was rendered by blindness doubly intolerable, she began, withoutstretched arms, to feel around her prison for some channel of escape;and finding the only entrance secure, she called aloud, and with thevehemence of a temper naturally violent, and now sharpened by impatientagony.\'Ho, girl!\' said the slave in attendance, opening the door; art thou bitby a scorpion? or thinkest thou that we are dying of silence here, andonly to be preserved, like the infant Jupiter, by a hullabaloo?\'\'Where is thy master? and wherefore am I caged here?  I want air andliberty: let me go forth!\'\'Alas! little one, hast thou not seen enough of Arbaces to know that hiswill is imperial!  He hath ordered thee to be caged; and caged thou art,and I am thy keeper.  Thou canst not have air and liberty; but thoumayst have what are much better things--food and wine.\'\'Proh Jupiter!\' cried the girl, wringing her hands; \'and why am I thusimprisoned?  What can the great Arbaces want with so poor a thing as Iam?\'\'That I know not, unless it be to attend on thy new mistress, who hasbeen brought hither this day.\'\'What! Ione here?\'\'Yes, poor lady; she liked it little, I fear.  Yet, by the Temple ofCastor! Arbaces is a gallant man to the women.  Thy lady is his ward,thou knowest.\'\'Wilt thou take me to her?\'\'She is ill--frantic with rage and spite.  Besides, I have no orders todo so; and I never think for myself.  When Arbaces made me slave ofthese chambers, he said, ""I have but one lesson to give thee--while thouservest me, thou must have neither ears, eyes, nor thought; thou must bebut one quality--obedience.""\'\'But what harm is there in seeing Ione?\'\'That I know not; but if thou wantest a companion, I am willing to talkto thee, little one, for I am solitary enough in my dull cubiculum.And, by the way, thou art Thessalian--knowest thou not some cunningamusement of knife and shears, some pretty trick of telling fortunes, asmost of thy race do, in order to pass the time.\'\'Tush, slave, hold thy peace! or, if thou wilt speak, what hast thouheard of the state of Glaucus?\'\'Why, my master has gone to the Athenian\'s trial; Glaucus will smart forit!\'\'For what?\'\'The murder of the priest Apaecides.\'\'Ha!\' said Nydia, pressing her hands to her forehead; \'something of thisI have indeed heard, but understand not.  Yet, who will dare to touch ahair of his head?\'\'That will the lion, I fear.\'\'Averting gods! what wickedness dost thou utter?\'\'Why, only that, if he be found guilty, the lion, or may be the tiger,will be his executioner.\'Nydia leaped up, as if an arrow had entered her heart; she uttered apiercing scream; then, falling before the feet of the slave, she cried,in a tone that melted even his rude heart:\'Ah! tell me thou jestest--thou utterest not the truth--speak, speak!\'\'Why, by my faith, blind girl, I know nothing of the law; it may not beso bad as I say.  But Arbaces is his accuser, and the people desire avictim for the arena.  Cheer thee! But what hath the fate of theAthenian to do with thine?\'\'No matter, no matter--he has been kind to me: thou knowest not, then,what they will do?  Arbaces his accuser!  O fate!  The people--thepeople!  Ah! they can look upon his face--who will be cruel to theAthenian!--Yet was not Love itself cruel to him?\'So saying, her head drooped upon her bosom: she sunk into silence;scalding tears flowed down her cheeks; and all the kindly efforts of theslave were unable either to console her or distract the absorption ofher reverie.When his household cares obliged the ministrant to leave her room, Nydiabegan to re-collect her thoughts.  Arbaces was the accuser of Glaucus;Arbaces had imprisoned her here; was not that a proof that her libertymight be serviceable to Glaucus?  Yes, she was evidently inveigled intosome snare; she was contributing to the destruction of her beloved!  Oh,how she panted for release!  Fortunately, for her sufferings, all senseof pain became merged in the desire of escape; and as she began torevolve the possibility of deliverance, she grew calm and thoughtful.She possessed much of the craft of her sex, and it had been increased inher breast by her early servitude.  What slave was ever destitute ofcunning?  She resolved to practise upon her keeper; and calling suddenlyto mind his superstitious query as to her Thessalian art, she hoped bythat handle to work out some method of release.  These doubts occupiedher mind during the rest of the day and the long hours of night; and,accordingly, when Sosia visited her the following morning, she hastenedto divert his garrulity into that channel in which it had before evinceda natural disposition to flow.She was aware, however, that her only chance of escape was at night; andaccordingly she was obliged with a bitter pang at the delay to defertill then her purposed attempt.\'The night,\' said she, \'is the sole time in which we can well decipherthe decrees of Fate--then it is thou must seek me.  But what desirestthou to learn?\'\'By Pollux! I should like to know as much as my master; but that is notto be expected.  Let me know, at least, whether I shall save enough topurchase my freedom, or whether this Egyptian will give it me fornothing.  He does such generous things sometimes.  Next, supposing thatbe true, shall I possess myself of that snug taberna among theMyropolia, which I have long had in my eye?  \'Tis a genteel trade thatof a perfumer, and suits a retired slave who has something of agentleman about him!\'\'Ay! so you would have precise answers to those questions?--there arevarious ways of satisfying you.  There is the Lithomanteia, orSpeaking-stone, which answers your prayer with an infant\'s voice; but,then, we have not that precious stone with us--costly is it and rare.Then there is the Gastromanteia, whereby the demon casts pale and deadlyimages upon the water, prophetic of the future.  But this art requiresalso glasses of a peculiar fashion, to contain the consecrated liquid,which we have not.  I think, therefore, that the simplest method ofsatisfying your desire would be by the Magic of Air.\'\'I trust,\' said Sosia, tremulously, \'that there is nothing veryfrightful in the operation?  I have no love for apparitions.\'\'Fear not; thou wilt see nothing; thou wilt only hear by the bubbling ofwater whether or not thy suit prospers.  First, then, be sure, from therising of the evening star, that thou leavest the garden-gate somewhatopen, so that the demon may feel himself invited to enter therein; andplace fruits and water near the gate as a sign of hospitality; then,three hours after twilight, come here with a bowl of the coldest andpurest water, and thou shalt learn all, according to the Thessalian loremy mother taught me. But forget not the garden-gate--all rests uponthat: it must be open when you come, and for three hours previously.\'\'Trust me,\' replied the unsuspecting Sosia; \'I know what a gentleman\'sfeelings are when a door is shut in his face, as the cookshop\'s hathbeen in mine many a day; and I know, also, that a person ofrespectability, as a demon of course is, cannot but be pleased, on theother hand, with any little mark of courteous hospitality.  Meanwhile,pretty one, here is thy morning\'s meal.\'\'But what of the trial?\'\'Oh, the lawyers are still at it--talk, talk--it will last over allto-morrow.\'\'To-morrow?  You are sure of that?\'\'So I hear.\'\'And Ione?\'\'By Bacchus! she must be tolerably well, for she was strong enough tomake my master stamp and bite his lip this morning.  I saw him quit herapartment with a brow like a thunderstorm.\'\'Lodges she near this?\'\'No--in the upper apartments.  But I must not stay prating here longer.Vale!\'Chapter XIIA WASP VENTURES INTO THE SPIDER\'S WEB.THE second night of the trial had set in; and it was nearly the time inwhich Sosia was to brave the dread Unknown, when there entered, at thatvery garden-gate which the slave had left ajar--not, indeed, one of themysterious spirits of earth or air, but the heavy and most human form ofCalenus, the priest of Isis.  He scarcely noted the humble offerings ofindifferent fruit, and still more indifferent wine, which the piousSosia had deemed good enough for the invisible stranger they wereintended to allure.  \'Some tribute,\' thought he, \'to the garden god.  Bymy father\'s head! if his deityship were never better served, he would dowell to give up the godly profession.  Ah! were it not for us priests,the gods would have a sad time of it.  And now for Arbaces--I amtreading a quicksand, but it ought to cover a mine.  I have theEgyptian\'s life in my power--what will he value it at?\'As he thus soliloquised, he crossed through the open court into theperistyle, where a few lamps here and there broke upon the empire of thestarlit night; and issuing from one of the chambers that bordered thecolonnade, suddenly encountered Arbaces.\'Ho! Calenus--seekest thou me?\' said the Egyptian; and there was alittle embarrassment in his voice.\'Yes, wise Arbaces--I trust my visit is not unseasonable?\'\'Nay--it was but this instant that my freedman Callias sneezed thrice atmy right hand; I knew, therefore, some good fortune was in store forme--and, lo! the gods have sent me Calenus.\'\'Shall we within to your chamber, Arbaces?\'\'As you will; but the night is clear and balmy--I have some remains oflanguor yet lingering on me from my recent illness--the air refreshesme--let us walk in the garden--we are equally alone there.\'\'With all my heart,\' answered the priest; and the two friends passedslowly to one of the many terraces which, bordered by marble vases andsleeping flowers, intersected the garden.\'It is a lovely night,\' said Arbaces--\'blue and beautiful as that onwhich, twenty years ago, the shores of Italy first broke upon my view.My Calenus, age creeps upon us--let us, at least, feel that we havelived.\'\'Thou, at least, mayst arrogate that boast,\' said Calenus, beatingabout, as it were, for an opportunity to communicate the secret whichweighed upon him, and feeling his usual awe of Arbaces still moreimpressively that night, from the quiet and friendly tone of dignifiedcondescension which the Egyptian assumed--\'Thou, at least, maystarrogate that boast.  Thou hast had countless wealth--a frame on whoseclose-woven fibres disease can find no space to enter--prosperouslove--inexhaustible pleasure--and, even at this hour, triumphantrevenge.\'\'Thou alludest to the Athenian.  Ay, to-morrow\'s sun the fiat of hisdeath will go forth.  The senate does not relent.  But thou mistakest:his death gives me no other gratification than that it releases me froma rival in the affections of Ione.  I entertain no other sentiment ofanimosity against that unfortunate homicide.\'\'Homicide!\' repeated Calenus, slowly and meaningly; and, halting as hespoke, he fixed his eyes upon Arbaces.  The stars shone pale andsteadily on the proud face of their prophet, but they betrayed there nochange: the eyes of Calenus fell disappointed and abashed.  He continuedrapidly--\'Homicide! it is well to charge him with that crime; but thou,of all men, knowest that he is innocent.\'\'Explain thyself,\' said Arbaces, coldly; for he had prepared himself forthe hint his secret fears had foretold.\'Arbaces,\' answered Calenus, sinking his voice into a whisper, \'I was inthe sacred grove, sheltered by the chapel and the surrounding foliage.I overheard--I marked the whole.  I saw thy weapon pierce the heart ofApaecides.  I blame not the deed--it destroyed a foe and an apostate.\'\'Thou sawest the whole!\' said Arbaces, dryly; \'so I imagined--thou wertalone.\'\'Alone!\' returned Calenus, surprised at the Egyptian\'s calmness.\'And wherefore wert thou hid behind the chapel at that hour?\'\'Because I had learned the conversion of Apaecides to the Christianfaith--because I knew that on that spot he was to meet the fierceOlinthus--because they were to meet there to discuss plans for unveilingthe sacred mysteries of our goddess to the people--and I was there todetect, in order to defeat them.\'\'Hast thou told living ear what thou didst witness?\'\'No, my master: the secret is locked in thy servant\'s breast.\'\'What! even thy kinsman Burbo guesses it not!  Come, the truth!\'\'By the gods...\'\'Hush! we know each other--what are the gods to us?\'\'By the fear of thy vengeance, then--no!\'\'And why hast thou hitherto concealed from me this secret?  Why hastthou waited till the eve of the Athenian\'s condemnation before thou hastventured to tell me that Arbaces is a murderer?  And having tarried solong, why revealest thou now that knowledge?\'\'Because--because...\' stammered Calenus, coloring and in confusion.\'Because,\' interrupted Arbaces, with a gentle smile, and tapping thepriest on the shoulder with a kindly and familiar gesture--\'because,my Calenus (see now, I will read thy heart, and explain itsmotives)--because thou didst wish thoroughly to commit and entangle mein the trial, so that I might have no loophole of escape; that I mightstand firmly pledged to perjury and to malice, as well as to homicide;that having myself whetted the appetite of the populace to blood, nowealth, no power, could prevent my becoming their victim: and thoutellest me thy secret now, ere the trial be over and the innocentcondemned, to show what a desperate web of villainy thy word to-morrowcould destroy; to enhance in this, the ninth hour, the price of thyforbearance; to show that my own arts, in arousing the popular wrath,would, at thy witness, recoil upon myself; and that if not for Glaucus,for me would gape the jaws of the lion! Is it not so?\'\'Arbaces, replied Calenus, losing all the vulgar audacity of his naturalcharacter, \'verily thou art a Magician; thou readest the heart as itwere a scroll.\'\'It is my vocation,\' answered the Egyptian, laughing gently. \'Well,then, forbear; and when all is over, I will make thee rich.\'\'Pardon me,\' said the priest, as the quick suggestion of that avarice,which was his master-passion, bade him trust no future chance ofgenerosity; \'pardon me; thou saidst right--we know each other.  If thouwouldst have me silent, thou must pay something in advance, as an offerto Harpocrates.\' If the rose, sweet emblem of discretion, is to takeroot firmly, water her this night with a stream of gold.\'\'Witty and poetical!\' answered Arbaces, still in that bland voice whichlulled and encouraged, when it ought to have alarmed and checked, hisgriping comrade.  \'Wilt thou not wait the morrow?\'\'Why this delay?  Perhaps, when I can no longer give my testimonywithout shame for not having given it ere the innocent man suffered,thou wilt forget my claim; and, indeed, thy present hesitation is a badomen of thy future gratitude.\'\'Well, then, Calenus, what wouldst thou have me pay thee?\'\'Thy life is, very precious, and thy wealth is very great,\' returned thepriest, grinning.\'Wittier and more witty.  But speak out--what shall be the sum?\'\'Arbaces, I have heard that in thy secret treasury below, beneath thoserude Oscan arches which prop thy stately halls, thou hast piles of gold,of vases, and of jewels, which might rival the receptacles of the wealthof the deified Nero.  Thou mayst easily spare out of those piles enoughto make Calenus among the richest priests of Pompeii, and yet not missthe loss.\'\'Come, Calenus,\' said Arbaces, winningly, and with a frank and generousair, \'thou art an old friend, and hast been a faithful servant.  Thoucanst have no wish to take away my life, nor I a desire to stint thyreward: thou shalt descend with me to that treasury thou referrest to,thou shalt feast thine eyes with the blaze of uncounted gold and thesparkle of priceless gems; and thou shalt for thy own reward, bear awaywith thee this night as much as thou canst conceal beneath thy robes.Nay, when thou hast once seen what thy friend possesses, thou wilt learnhow foolish it would be to injure one who has so much to bestow.  WhenGlaucus is no more, thou shalt pay the treasury another visit.  Speak Ifrankly and as a friend?\'\'Oh, greatest, best of men!\' cried Calenus, almost weeping with joy,\'canst thou thus forgive my injurious doubts of thy justice, thygenerosity?\'\'Hush! one other turn and we will descend to the Oscan arches.\'Chapter XIIITHE SLAVE CONSULTS THE ORACLE.  THEY WHO BLIND THEMSELVES THE BLIND MAYFOOL.  TWO NEW PRISONERS MADE IN ONE NIGHT.IMPATIENTLY Nydia awaited the arrival of the no less anxious Sosia.Fortifying his courage by plentiful potations of a better liquor thanthat provided for the demon, the credulous ministrant stole into theblind girl\'s chamber.\'Well, Sosia, and art thou prepared?  Hast thou the bowl of pure water?\'\'Verily, yes: but I tremble a little.  You are sure I shall not see thedemon?  I have heard that those gentlemen are by no means of a handsomeperson or a civil demeanor.\'\'Be assured!  And hast thou left the garden-gate gently open?\'\'Yes; and placed some beautiful nuts and apples on a little table closeby?\'\'That\'s well.  And the gate is open now, so that the demon may passthrough it?\'\'Surely it is.\'\'Well, then, open this door; there--leave it just ajar.  And now, Sosia,give me the lamp.\'\'What, you will not extinguish it?\'\'No; but I must breathe my spell over its ray.  There is a spirit infire. Seat thyself.\'The slave obeyed; and Nydia, after bending for some moments silentlyover the lamp, rose, and in a low voice chanted the following rude:--     INVOCATION TO THE SPECTRE OF THE AIR       Loved alike by Air and Water        Aye must be Thessalia\'s daughter;        To us, Olympian hearts, are given        Spells that draw the moon from heaven.          All that Egypt\'s learning wrought--        All that Persia\'s Magian taught--       Won from song, or wrung from flowers,        Or whisper\'d low by fiend--are ours.       Spectre of the viewless air!        Hear the blind Thessalian\'s prayer!        By Erictho\'s art, that shed        Dews of life when life was fled--       By lone Ithaca\'s wise king,        Who could wake the crystal spring        To the voice of prophecy?        By the lost Eurydice,        Summon\'d from the shadowy throng,        As the muse-son\'s magic song--       By the Colchian\'s awful charms,        When fair-haired Jason left her arms--       Spectre of the airy halls,        One who owns thee duly calls!        Breathe along the brimming bowl,        And instruct the fearful soul        In the shadowy things that lie        Dark in dim futurity.        Come, wild demon of the air,        Answer to thy votary\'s prayer!          Come! oh, come!       And no god on heaven or earth--       Not the Paphian Queen of Mirth,        Not the vivid Lord of Light,        Nor the triple Maid of Night,        Nor the Thunderer\'s self shall be        Blest and honour\'d more than thee!          Come! oh, come!\'The spectre is certainly coming,\' said Sosia.  \'I feel him runningalong my hair!\'\'Place thy bowl of water on the ground.  Now, then, give me thy napkin,and let me fold up thy face and eyes.\'\'Ay! that\'s always the custom with these charms.  Not so tight, though:gently--gently!\'\'There--thou canst not see?\'\'See, by Jupiter!  No!  nothing but darkness.\'\'Address, then, to the spectre whatever question thou wouldst ask him,in a low-whispered voice, three times.  If thy question is answered inthe affirmative, thou wilt hear the water ferment and bubble before thedemon breathes upon it; if in the negative, the water will be quitesilent.\'\'But you will not play any trick with the water, eh?\'\'Let me place the bowl under thy feet--so.  Now thou wilt perceive thatI cannot touch it without thy knowledge.\'\'Very fair.  Now, then, O Bacchus! befriend me.  Thou knowest that Ihave always loved thee better than all the other gods, and I willdedicate to thee that silver cup I stole last year from the burlycarptor (butler), if thou wilt but befriend me with this water-lovingdemon.  And thou, O Spirit! listen and hear me.  Shall I be enabled topurchase my freedom next year? Thou knowest; for, as thou livest in theair, the birds have doubtless acquainted thee with every secret of thishouse,--thou knowest that I have filched and pilfered all that Ihonestly--that is, safely--could lay finger upon for the last threeyears, and I yet want two thousand sesterces of the full sum.  Shall Ibe able, O good Spirit! to make up the deficiency in the course of thisyear?  Speak--Ha! does the water bubble?  No; all is as still as atomb.--Well, then, if not this year, in two years?--Ah! I hearsomething; the demon is scratching at the door; he\'ll be herepresently.--In two years, my good fellow: come now, two; that\'s a veryreasonable time. What! dumb still!  Two years and a half--three--four?ill fortune to you, friend demon!  You are not a lady, that\'s clear, oryou would not keep silence so long.  Five--six--sixty years? and mayPluto seize you!  I\'ll ask no more.\' And Sosia, in a rage, kicked downthe water over his legs.  He then, after much fumbling and more cursing,managed to extricate his head from the napkin in which it was completelyfolded--stared round--and discovered that he was in the dark.\'What, ho! Nydia; the lamp is gone.  Ah, traitress; and thou art gonetoo; but I\'ll catch thee--thou shalt smart for this!\' The slave gropedhis way to the door; it was bolted from without: he was a prisonerinstead of Nydia. What could he do?  He did not dare to knock loud--tocall out--lest Arbaces should overhear him, and discover how he had beenduped; and Nydia, meanwhile, had probably already gained thegarden-gate, and was fast on her escape.\'But,\' thought he, \'she will go home, or, at least, be somewhere in thecity.  To-morrow, at dawn, when the slaves are at work in the peristyle,I can make myself heard; then I can go forth and seek her.  I shall besure to find and bring her back, before Arbaces knows a word of thematter.  Ah! that\'s the best plan.  Little traitress, my fingers itch atthee: and to leave only a bowl of water, too!  Had it been wine, itwould have been some comfort.\'While Sosia, thus entrapped, was lamenting his fate, and revolving hisschemes to repossess himself of Nydia, the blind girl, with thatsingular precision and dexterous rapidity of motion, which, we havebefore observed, was peculiar to her, had passed lightly along theperistyle, threaded the opposite passage that led into the garden, and,with a beating heart, was about to proceed towards the gate, when shesuddenly heard the sound of approaching steps, and distinguished thedreaded voice of Arbaces himself. She paused for a moment in doubt andterror; then suddenly it flashed across her recollection that there wasanother passage which was little used except for the admission of thefair partakers of the Egyptian\'s secret revels, and which wound alongthe basement of that massive fabric towards a door which alsocommunicated with the garden.  By good fortune it might be open.  Atthat thought, she hastily retraced her steps, descended the narrowstairs at the right, and was soon at the entrance of the passage.  Alas!the door at the entrance was closed and secured. While she was yetassuring herself that it was indeed locked, she heard behind her thevoice of Calenus, and, a moment after, that of Arbaces in low reply.She could not stay there; they were probably passing to that very door.She sprang onward, and felt herself in unknown ground.  The air grewdamp and chill; this reassured her. She thought she might be among thecellars of the luxurious mansion, or, at least, in some rude spot notlikely to be visited by its haughty lord, when again her quick earcaught steps and the sound of voices. On, on, she hurried, extending herarms, which now frequently encountered pillars of thick and massiveform.  With a tact, doubled in acuteness by her fear, she escaped theseperils, and continued her way, the air growing more and more damp as sheproceeded; yet, still, as she ever and anon paused for breath, she heardthe advancing steps and the indistinct murmur of voices.  At length shewas abruptly stopped by a wall that seemed the limit of her path. Wasthere no spot in which she could hide?  No aperture? no cavity?  Therewas none!  She stopped, and wrung her hands in despair; then again,nerved as the voices neared upon her, she hurried on by the side of thewall; and coming suddenly against one of the sharp buttresses that hereand there jutted boldly forth, she fell to the ground.  Though muchbruised, her senses did not leave her; she uttered no cry; nay, shehailed the accident that had led her to something like a screen; andcreeping close up to the angle formed by the buttress, so that on oneside at least she was sheltered from view, she gathered her slight andsmall form into its smallest compass, and breathlessly awaited her fate.Meanwhile Arbaces and the priest were taking their way to that secretchamber whose stores were so vaunted by the Egyptian.  They were in avast subterranean atrium, or hall; the low roof was supported by short,thick pillars of an architecture far remote from the Grecian graces ofthat luxuriant period.  The single and pale lamp, which Arbaces bore,shed but an imperfect ray over the bare and rugged walls, in which thehuge stones, without cement, were fitted curiously and uncouthly intoeach other.  The disturbed reptiles glared dully on the intruders, andthen crept into the shadow of the walls.Calenus shivered as he looked around and breathed the damp, unwholesomeair.\'Yet,\' said Arbaces, with a smile, perceiving his shudder, \'it is theserude abodes that furnish the luxuries of the halls above. They are likethe laborers of the world--we despise their ruggedness, yet they feedthe very pride that disdains them.\'\'And whither goes yon dim gallery to the left asked Calenus; \'in thisdepth of gloom it seems without limit, as if winding into Hades.\'\'On the contrary, it does but conduct to the upper rooms,\' answeredArbaces, carelessly: \'it is to the right that we steer to our bourn.\'The hall, like many in the more habitable regions of Pompeii, branchedoff at the extremity into two wings or passages; the length of which,not really great, was to the eye considerably exaggerated by the suddengloom against which the lamp so faintly struggled.  To the right ofthese alae, the two comrades now directed their steps.\'The gay Glaucus will be lodged to-morrow in apartments not much drier,and far less spacious than this,\' said Calenus, as they passed by thevery spot where, completely wrapped in the shadow of the broad,projecting buttress, cowered the Thessalian.\'Ay, but then he will have dry room, and ample enough, in the arena onthe following day.  And to think,\' continued Arbaces, slowly, and verydeliberately--\'to think that a word of thine could save him, and consignArbaces to his doom!\'\'That word shall never be spoken,\' said Calenus.\'Right, my Calenus! it never shall,\' returned Arbaces, familiarlyleaning his arm on the priest\'s shoulder: \'and now, halt--we are at thedoor.\'The light trembled against a small door deep set in the wall, andguarded strongly by many plates and bindings of iron, that intersectedthe rough and dark wood.  From his girdle Arbaces now drew a small ring,holding three or four short but strong keys.  Oh, how beat the gripingheart of Calenus, as he heard the rusty wards growl, as if resenting theadmission to the treasures they guarded!\'Enter, my friend,\' said Arbaces, \'while I hold the lamp on high, thatthou mayst glut thine eyes on the yellow heaps.\'The impatient Calenus did not wait to be twice invited; he hastenedtowards the aperture.Scarce had he crossed the threshold, when the strong hand of Arbacesplunged him forwards.\'The word shall never be spoken!\' said the Egyptian, with a loudexultant laugh, and closed the door upon the priest.Calenus had been precipitated down several steps, but not feeling at themoment the pain of his fall, he sprung up again to the door, and beatingat it fiercely with his clenched fist, he cried aloud in what seemedmore a beast\'s howl than a human voice, so keen was his agony anddespair: \'Oh, release me, release me, and I will ask no gold!\'The words but imperfectly penetrated the massive door, and Arbaces againlaughed.  Then, stamping his foot violently, rejoined, perhaps to givevent to his long-stifled passions:\'All the gold of Dalmatia,\' cried he, \'will not buy thee a crust ofbread. Starve, wretch! thy dying groans will never wake even the echo ofthese vast halls; nor will the air ever reveal, as thou gnawest, in thydesperate famine, thy flesh from thy bones, that so perishes the man whothreatened, and could have undone, Arbaces! Farewell!\'\'Oh, pity--mercy! Inhuman villain; was it for this...\'The rest of the sentence was lost to the ear of Arbaces as he passedbackward along the dim hall.  A toad, plump and bloated, lay unmovingbefore his path; the rays of the lamp fell upon its unshaped hideousnessand red upward eye.  Arbaces turned aside that he might not harm it.\'Thou art loathsome and obscene,\' he muttered, \'but thou canst notinjure me; therefore thou art safe in my path.\'The cries of Calenus, dulled and choked by the barrier that confinedhim, yet faintly reached the ear of the Egyptian.  He paused andlistened intently.\'This is unfortunate,\' thought he; \'for I cannot sail till that voice isdumb for ever.  My stores and treasures lie, not in yon dungeon it istrue, but in the opposite wing.  My slaves, as they move them, must nothear his voice.  But what fear of that?  In three days, if he stillsurvive, his accents, by my father\'s beard, must be weak enough,then!--no, they could not pierce even through his tomb.  By Isis, it iscold!--I long for a deep draught of the spiced Falernian.\'With that the remorseless Egyptian drew his gown closer round him, andresought the upper air.Chapter XIVNYDIA ACCOSTS CALENUS.WHAT words of terror, yet of hope, had Nydia overheard!  The next dayGlaucus was to be condemned; yet there lived one who could save him, andadjudge Arbaces to his doom, and that one breathed within a few steps ofher hiding-place!  She caught his cries and shrieks--hisimprecations--his prayers, though they fell choked and muffled on herear.  He was imprisoned, but she knew the secret of his cell: could shebut escape--could she but seek the praetor he might yet in time be givento light, and preserve the Athenian.  Her emotions almost stifled her;her brain reeled--she felt her sense give way--but by a violent effortshe mastered herself,--and, after listening intently for severalminutes, till she was convinced that Arbaces had left the space tosolitude and herself, she crept on as her ear guided her to the verydoor that had closed upon Calenus.  Here she more distinctly caught hisaccents of terror and despair.  Thrice she attempted to speak, andthrice her voice failed to penetrate the folds of the heavy door.  Atlength finding the lock, she applied her lips to its small aperture, andthe prisoner distinctly heard a soft tone breathe his name.His blood curdled--his hair stood on end.  That awful solitude, whatmysterious and preternatural being could penetrate!  \'Who\'s there?\' hecried, in new alarm; \'what spectre--what dread larva, calls upon thelost Calenus?\'\'Priest,\' replied the Thessalian, \'unknown to Arbaces, I have been, bythe permission of the gods, a witness to his perfidy.  If I myself canescape from these walls, I may save thee.  But let thy voice reach myear through this narrow passage, and answer what I ask.\'\'Ah, blessed spirit,\' said the priest, exultingly, and obeying thesuggestion of Nydia, \'save me, and I will sell the very cups on thealtar to pay thy kindness.\'\'I want not thy gold--I want thy secret.  Did I hear aright? Canst thousave the Athenian Glaucus from the charge against his life?\'\'I can--I can!--therefore (may the Furies blast the foul Egyptian!) hathArbaces snared me thus, and left me to starve and rot!\'\'They accuse the Athenian of murder: canst thou disprove theaccusation?\'\'Only free me, and the proudest head of Pompeii is not more safe thanhis. I saw the deed done--I saw Arbaces strike the blow; I can convictthe true murderer and acquit the innocent man.  But if I perish, he diesalso.  Dost thou interest thyself for him?  Oh, blessed stranger, in myheart is the urn which condemns or frees him!\'\'And thou wilt give full evidence of what thou knowest?\'\'Will!--Oh! were hell at my feet--yes!  Revenge on the falseEgyptian!--revenge!--revenge! revenge!\'As through his ground teeth Calenus shrieked forth those last words,Nydia felt that in his worst passions was her certainty of his justiceto the Athenian.  Her heart beat: was it to be her proud destiny topreserve her idolized--her adored?  Enough,\' said she, \'the powers thatconducted me hither will carry me through all.  Yes, I feel that I shalldeliver thee. Wait in patience and hope.\'\'But be cautious, be prudent, sweet stranger.  Attempt not to appeal toArbaces--he is marble.  Seek the praetor--say what thou knowest--obtainhis writ of search; bring soldiers, and smiths of cunning--these locksare wondrous strong!  Time flies--I may starve--starve! if you are notquick! Go--go!  Yet stay--it is horrible to be alone!--the air is like acharnel--and the scorpions--ha! and the pale larvae; oh! stay, stay!\'\'Nay,\' said Nydia, terrified by the terror of the priest, and anxious toconfer with herself--\'nay, for thy sake, I must depart. Take hope forthy companion--farewell!\'So saying, she glided away, and felt with extended arms along thepillared space until she had gained the farther end of the hall and themouth of the passage that led to the upper air.  But there she paused;she felt that it would be more safe to wait awhile, until the night wasso far blended with the morning that the whole house would be buried insleep, and so that she might quit it unobserved.  She, therefore, oncemore laid herself down, and counted the weary moments.  In her sanguineheart, joy was the predominant emotion.  Glaucus was in deadlyperil--but she should save him!Chapter XVARBACES AND IONE.  NYDIA GAINS THE GARDEN.  WILL SHE ESCAPE AND SAVE THEATHENIAN?WHEN Arbaces had warmed his veins by large draughts of that spiced andperfumed wine so valued by the luxurious, he felt more than usuallyelated and exultant of heart.  There is a pride in triumphant ingenuity,not less felt, perhaps, though its object be guilty.  Our vain humannature hugs itself in the consciousness of superior craft andself-obtained success--afterwards comes the horrible reaction ofremorse.But remorse was not a feeling which Arbaces was likely ever toexperience for the fate of the base Calenus.  He swept from hisremembrance the thought of the priest\'s agonies and lingering death: hefelt only that a great danger was passed, and a possible foe silenced;all left to him now would be to account to the priesthood for thedisappearance of Calenus; and this he imagined it would not be difficultto do.  Calenus had often been employed by him in various religiousmissions to the neighboring cities.  On some such errand he could nowassert that he had been sent, with offerings to the shrines of Isis atHerculaneum and Neapolis, placatory of the goddess for the recent murderof her priest Apaecides.  When Calenus had expired, his body might bethrown, previous to the Egyptian\'s departure from Pompeii, into the deepstream of the Sarnus; and when discovered, suspicion would probably fallupon the Nazarene atheists, as an act of revenge for the death ofOlinthus at the arena. After rapidly running over these plans forscreening himself, Arbaces dismissed at once from his mind allrecollection of the wretched priest; and, animated by the success whichhad lately crowned all his schemes, he surrendered his thoughts to Ione.The last time he had seen her, she had driven him from her presence by areproachful and bitter scorn, which his arrogant nature was unable toendure.  He now felt emboldened once more to renew that interview; forhis passion for her was like similar feelings in other men--it made himrestless for her presence, even though in that presence he wasexasperated and humbled.  From delicacy to her grief he laid not asidehis dark and unfestive robes, but, renewing the perfumes on his ravenlocks, and arranging his tunic in its most becoming folds, he sought thechamber of the Neapolitan.  Accosting the slave in attendance without,he inquired if Ione had yet retired to rest; and learning that she wasstill up, and unusually quiet and composed, he ventured into herpresence.  He found his beautiful ward sitting before a small table, andleaning her face upon both her hands in the attitude of thought.  Yetthe expression of the face itself possessed not its wonted bright andPsyche-like expression of sweet intelligence; the lips were apart--theeye vacant and unheeding--and the long dark hair, falling neglected anddisheveled upon her neck, gave by the contrast additional paleness to acheek which had already lost the roundness of its contour.Arbaces gazed upon her a moment ere he advanced.  She, too, lifted upher eyes; and when she saw who was the intruder, shut them with anexpression of pain, but did not stir.\'Ah!\' said Arbaces in a low and earnest tone as he respectfully, nay,humbly, advanced and seated himself at a little distance from thetable--\'Ah! that my death could remove thy hatred, then would I gladlydie! Thou wrongest me, Ione; but I will bear the wrong without a murmur,only let me see thee sometimes.  Chide, reproach, scorn me, if thouwilt--I will teach myself to bear it.  And is not even thy bitteresttone sweeter to me than the music of the most artful lute? In thysilence the world seems to stand still--a stagnation curdles up theveins of the earth--there is no earth, no life, without the light of thycountenance and the melody of thy voice.\'\'Give me back my brother and my betrothed,\' said Ione, in a calm andimploring tone, and a few large tears rolled unheeded down her cheeks.\'Would that I could restore the one and save the other!\' returnedArbaces, with apparent emotion.  \'Yes; to make thee happy I wouldrenounce my ill-fated love, and gladly join thy hand to the Athenian\'s.Perhaps he will yet come unscathed from his trial (Arbaces had preventedher learning that the trial had already commenced); if so, thou art freeto judge or condemn him thyself.  And think not, O Ione, that I wouldfollow thee longer with a prayer of love.  I know it is in vain.  Sufferme only to weep--to mourn with thee.  Forgive a violence deeplyrepented, and that shall offend no more.  Let me be to thee only what Ionce was--a friend, a father, a Protector.  Ah, Ione! spare me andforgive.\'\'I forgive thee.  Save but Glaucus, and I will renounce him.  O mightyArbaces! thou art powerful in evil or in good: save the Athenian, andthe poor Ione will never see him more.\' As she spoke, she rose with weakand trembling limbs, and falling at his feet, she clasped his knees:\'Oh! if thou really lovest me--if thou art human--remember my father\'sashes, remember my childhood, think of all the hours we passed happilytogether, and save my Glaucus!\'Strange convulsions shook the frame of the Egyptian; his features workedfearfully--he turned his face aside, and said, in a hollow voice, \'If Icould save him, even now, I would; but the Roman law is stern and sharp.Yet if I could succeed--if I could rescue and set him free--wouldst thoube mine--my bride?\'\'Thine?\' repeated Ione, rising: \'thine!--thy bride?  My brother\'s bloodis unavenged: who slew him?  O Nemesis, can I even sell, for the life ofGlaucus, thy solemn trust?  Arbaces--thine?  Never.\'\'Ione, Ione!\' cried Arbaces, passionately; \'why these mysteriouswords?--why dost thou couple my name with the thought of thy brother\'sdeath?\'\'My dreams couple it--and dreams are from the gods.\'\'Vain fantasies all!  Is it for a dream that thou wouldst wrong theinnocent, and hazard thy sole chance of saving thy lover\'s life?\'\'Hear me!\' said Ione, speaking firmly, and with a deliberate and solemnvoice: \'If Glaucus be saved by thee, I will never be borne to his home abride.  But I cannot master the horror of other rites: I cannot wed withthee.  Interrupt me not; but mark me, Arbaces!--if Glaucus die, on thatsame day I baffle thine arts, and leave to thy love only my dust!Yes--thou mayst put the knife and the poison from my reach--thou maystimprison--thou mayst chain me, but the brave soul resolved to escape isnever without means.  These hands, naked and unarmed though they be,shall tear away the bonds of life.  Fetter them, and these lips shallfirmly refuse the air. Thou art learned--thou hast read how women havedied rather than meet dishonour.  If Glaucus perish, I will notunworthily linger behind him.  By all the gods of the heaven, and theocean, and the earth, I devote myself to death!  I have said!\'High, proud, dilating in her stature, like one inspired, the air andvoice of Ione struck an awe into the breast of her listener.\'Brave heart!\' said he, after a short pause; \'thou art indeed worthy tobe mine.  Oh! that I should have dreamt of such a partner in my loftydestinies, and never found it but in thee! Ione,\' he continued rapidly,\'dost thou not see that we are born for each other? Canst thou notrecognize something kindred to thine own energy--thine own courage--inthis high and self-dependent soul?  We were formed to unite oursympathies--formed to breathe a new spirit into this hackneyed and grossworld--formed for the mighty ends which my soul, sweeping down the gloomof time, foresees with a prophet\'s vision.  With a resolution equal tothine own, I defy thy threats of an inglorious suicide.  I hail thee asmy own!  Queen of climes undarkened by the eagle\'s wing, unravaged byhis beak, I bow before thee in homage and in awe--but I claim thee inworship and in love! Together will we cross the ocean--together will wefound our realm; and far distant ages shall acknowledge the long race ofkings born from the marriage-bed of Arbaces and Ione!\'\'Thou ravest!  These mystic declamations are suited rather to somepalsied crone selling charms in the market-place than to the wiseArbaces.  Thou hast heard my resolution--it is fixed as the Fatesthemselves.  Orcus has heard my vow, and it is written in the book ofthe unforgetful Hades. Atone, then, O Arbaces!--atone the past: converthatred into regard--vengeance into gratitude; preserve one who shallnever be thy rival. These are acts suited to thy original nature, whichgives forth sparks of something high and noble.  They weigh in thescales of the Kings of Death: they turn the balance on that day when thedisembodied soul stands shivering and dismayed between Tartarus andElysium; they gladden the heart in life, better and longer than thereward of a momentary passion.  Oh, Arbaces! hear me, and be swayed!\'\'Enough, Ione.  All that I can do for Glaucus shall be done; but blameme not if I fail.  Inquire of my foes, even, if I have not sought, if Ido not seek, to turn aside the sentence from his head; and judge meaccordingly. Sleep then, Ione.  Night wanes; I leave thee to rest--andmayst thou have kinder dreams of one who has no existence but in thine.\'Without waiting a reply, Arbaces hastily withdrew; afraid, perhaps, totrust himself further to the passionate prayer of Ione, which racked himwith jealousy, even while it touched him to compassion.  But compassionitself came too late.  Had Ione even pledged him her hand as his reward,he could not now--his evidence given--the populace excited--have savedthe Athenian. Still made sanguine by his very energy of mind, he threwhimself on the chances of the future, and believed he should yet triumphover the woman that had so entangled his passions.As his attendants assisted to unrobe him for the night, the thought ofNydia flashed across him.  He felt it was necessary that Ione shouldnever learn of her lover\'s frenzy, lest it might excuse his imputedcrime; and it was possible that her attendants might inform her thatNydia was under his roof, and she might desire to see her.  As this ideacrossed him, he turned to one of his freedmen:\'Go, Callias,\' said he, \'forthwith to Sosia, and tell him, that on nopretence is he to suffer the blind slave Nydia out of her chamber.  But,stay--first seek those in attendance upon my ward, and caution them notto inform her that the blind girl is under my roof Go--quick!\'The freedman hastened to obey.  After having discharged his commissionwith respect to Ione\'s attendants, he sought the worthy Sosia.  He foundhim not in the little cell which was apportioned for his cubiculum; hecalled his name aloud, and from Nydia\'s chamber, close at hand, he heardthe voice of Sosia reply:\'Oh, Callias, is it you that I hear?--the gods be praised!\' Open thedoor, I pray you!\'Callias withdrew the bolt, and the rueful face of Sosia hastilyprotruded itself.\'What!--in the chamber with that young girl, Sosia! Proh pudor! Arethere not fruits ripe enough on the wall, but that thou must tamper withsuch green...\'\'Name not the little witch!\' interrupted Sosia, impatiently; \'she willbe my ruin!\' And he forthwith imparted to Callias the history of the AirDemon, and the escape of the Thessalian.\'Hang thyself, then, unhappy Sosia!  I am just charged from Arbaces witha message to thee; on no account art thou to suffer her, even for amoment, from that chamber!\'\'Me miserum!\' exclaimed the slave.  \'What can I do!--by this time shemay have visited half Pompeii.  But tomorrow I will undertake to catchher in her old haunts.  Keep but my counsel, my dear Callias.\'\'I will do all that friendship can, consistent with my own safety. Butare you sure she has left the house?--she may be hiding here yet.\'\'How is that possible?  She could easily have gained the garden; and thedoor, as I told thee, was open.\'\'Nay, not so; for, at that very hour thou specifiest, Arbaces was in thegarden with the priest Calenus.  I went there in search of some herbsfor my master\'s bath to-morrow.  I saw the table set out; but the gate Iam sure was shut: depend upon it, that Calenus entered by the garden,and naturally closed the door after him.\'\'But it was not locked.\'\'Yes; for I myself, angry at a negligence which might expose the bronzesin the peristyle to the mercy of any robber, turned the key, took itaway, and--as I did not see the proper slave to whom to give it, or Ishould have rated him finely--here it actually is, still in my girdle.\'\'Oh, merciful Bacchus!  I did not pray to thee in vain, after all.  Letus not lose a moment!  Let us to the garden instantly--she may yet bethere!\'The good-natured Callias consented to assist the slave; and after vainlysearching the chambers at hand, and the recesses of the peristyle, theyentered the garden.It was about this time that Nydia had resolved to quit her hiding-place,and venture forth on her way.  Lightly, tremulously holding her breath,which ever and anon broke forth in quick convulsive gasps--now glidingby the flower--wreathed columns that bordered the peristyle--nowdarkening the still moonshine that fell over its tessellated centre--nowascending the terrace of the garden--now gliding amidst the gloomy andbreathless trees, she gained the fatal door--to find it locked!  We haveall seen that expression of pain, of uncertainty, of fear, which asudden disappointment of touch, if I may use the expression, casts overthe face of the blind. But what words can paint the intolerable woe, thesinking of the whole heart, which was now visible on the features of theThessalian? Again and again her small, quivering hands wandered to andfro the inexorable door. Poor thing that thou wert! in vain had been allthy noble courage, thy innocent craft, thy doublings to escape the houndand huntsmen!  Within but a few yards from thee, laughing at thyendeavors--thy despair--knowing thou wert now their own, and watchingwith cruel patience their own moment to seize their prey--thou art savedfrom seeing thy pursuers!\'Hush, Callias!--let her go on.  Let us see what she will do when shehas convinced herself that the door is honest.\'\'Look! she raises her face to the heavens--she mutters--she sinks downdespondent!  No!  by Pollux, she has some new scheme!  She will notresign herself!  By Jupiter, a tough spirit!  See, she springs up--sheretraces her steps--she thinks of some other chance!--I advise thee,Sosia, to delay no longer: seize her ere she quit the garden--now!\'\'Ah! runaway!  I have thee--eh?\' said Sosia, seizing upon the unhappyNydia. As a hare\'s last human cry in the fangs of the dogs--as the sharpvoice of terror uttered by a sleep-walker suddenly awakened--broke theshriek of the blind girl, when she felt the abrupt gripe of her gaoler.It was a shriek of such utter agony, such entire despair, that it mighthave rung hauntingly in your ears for ever.  She felt as if the lastplank of the sinking Glaucus were torn from his clasp!  It had been asuspense of life and death; and death had now won the game.\'Gods! that cry will alarm the house!  Arbaces sleeps full lightly. Gagher!\' cried Callias.\'Ah! here is the very napkin with which the young witch conjured away myreason!  Come, that\'s right; now thou art dumb as well as blind.\'And, catching the light weight in his arms, Sosia soon gained the house,and reached the chamber from which Nydia had escaped. There, removingthe gag, he left her to a solitude so racked and terrible, that out ofHades its anguish could scarcely be exceeded.Chapter XVITHE SORROW OF BOON COMPANIONS FOR OUR AFFLICTIONS.  THE DUNGEON AND ITSVICTIMS.IT was now late on the third and last day of the trial of Glaucus andOlinthus.  A few hours after the court had broken up and judgment beengiven, a small party of the fashionable youth at Pompeii were assembledround the fastidious board of Lepidus.\'So Glaucus denies his crime to the last?\' said Clodius.\'Yes; but the testimony of Arbaces was convincing; he saw the blowgiven,\' answered Lepidus.\'What could have been the cause?\'\'Why, the priest was a gloomy and sullen fellow.  He probably ratedGlaucus soundly about his gay life and gaming habits, and ultimatelyswore he would not consent to his marriage with Ione.  High words arose;Glaucus seems to have been full of the passionate god, and struck insudden exasperation. The excitement of wine, the desperation of abruptremorse, brought on the delirium under which he suffered for some days;and I can readily imagine, poor fellow! that, yet confused by thatdelirium, he is even now unconscious of the crime he committed!  Such,at least, is the shrewd conjecture of Arbaces, who seems to have beenmost kind and forbearing in his testimony.\'\'Yes; he has made himself generally popular by it.  But, inconsideration of these extenuating circumstances, the senate should haverelaxed the sentence.\'\'And they would have done so, but for the people; but they wereoutrageous. The priest had spared no pains to excite them; and theyimagined--the ferocious brutes!--because Glaucus was a rich man and agentleman, that he was likely to escape; and therefore they wereinveterate against him, and doubly resolved upon his sentence.  Itseems, by some accident or other, that he was never formally enrolled asa Roman citizen; and thus the senate is deprived of the power to resistthe people, though, after all, there was but a majority of three againsthim.  Ho! the Chian!\'\'He looks sadly altered; but how composed and fearless!\'\'Ay, we shall see if his firmness will last over to-morrow. But whatmerit in courage, when that atheistical hound, Olinthus, manifested thesame?\'\'The blasphemer!  Yes,\' said Lepidus, with pious wrath, \'no wonder thatone of the decurions was, but two days ago, struck dead by lightning ina serene sky.\' The gods feel vengeance against Pompeii while the viledesecrator is alive within its walls.\'\'Yet so lenient was the senate, that had he but expressed his penitence,and scattered a few grains of incense on the altar of Cybele, he wouldhave been let off.  I doubt whether these Nazarenes, had they the statereligion, would be as tolerant to us, supposing we had kicked down theimage of their Deity, blasphemed their rites, and denied their faith.\'\'They give Glaucus one chance, in consideration of the circumstances;they allow him, against the lion, the use of the same stilus wherewithhe smote the priest.\'\'Hast thou seen the lion? hast thou looked at his teeth and fangs, andwilt thou call that a chance?  Why, sword and buckler would be mere reedand papyrus against the rush of the mighty beast!  No, I think the truemercy has been, not to leave him long in suspense; and it was thereforefortunate for him that our benign laws are slow to pronounce, but swiftto execute; and that the games of the amphitheatre had been, by a sortof providence, so long since fixed for to-morrow.  He who awaits death,dies twice.\'\'As for the Atheist,\' said Clodius, \'he is to cope the grim tigernaked-handed.  Well, these combats are past betting on.  Who will takethe odds?\' A peal of laughter announced the ridicule of the question.\'Poor Clodius!\' said the host; \'I to lose a friend is something; but tofind no one to bet on the chance of his escape is a worse misfortune tothee.\'\'Why, it is provoking; it would have been some consolation to him and tome to think he was useful to the last.\'\'The people,\' said the grave Pansa, \'are all delighted with the result.They were so much afraid the sports at the amphitheatre would go offwithout a criminal for the beasts; and now, to get two such criminals isindeed a joy for the poor fellows!  They work hard; they ought to havesome amusement.\'\'There speaks the popular Pansa, who never moves without a string ofclients as long as an Indian triumph.  He is always prating about thepeople.  Gods! he will end by being a Gracchus!\'\'Certainly I am no insolent patrician,\' said Pansa, with a generous air.\'Well,\' observed Lepidus, \'it would have been assuredly dangerous to havebeen merciful at the eve of a beast-fight.  If ever I, though a Romanbred and born, come to be tried, pray Jupiter there may be either nobeasts in the vivaria, or plenty of criminals in the gaol.\'\'And pray,\' said one of the party, \'what has become of the poor girlwhom Glaucus was to have married?  A widow without being a bride--thatis hard!\'\'Oh,\' returned Clodius, \'she is safe under the protection of herguardian, Arbaces.  It was natural she should go to him when she hadlost both lover and brother.\'\'By sweet Venus, Glaucus was fortunate among the women.  They say therich Julia was in love with him.\'\'A mere fable, my friend,\' said Clodius, coxcombically; \'I was with herto-day.  If any feeling of the sort she ever conceived, I flatter myselfthat I have consoled her.\'\'Hush, gentlemen!\' said Pansa; \'do you not know that Clodius is employedat the house of Diomed in blowing hard at the torch?  It begins to burn,and will soon shine bright on the shrine of Hymen.\'\'Is it so?\' said Lepidus.  \'What! Clodius become a married man?--Fie!\'\'Never fear,\' answered Clodius; \'old Diomed is delighted at the notionof marrying his daughter to a nobleman, and will come down largely withthe sesterces.  You will see that I shall not lock them up in theatrium.  It will be a white day for his jolly friends, when Clodiusmarries an heiress.\'\'Say you so?\' cried Lepidus; \'come, then, a full cup to the health ofthe fair Julia!\'While such was the conversation--one not discordant to the tone of mindcommon among the dissipated of that day, and which might perhaps, acentury ago, have found an echo in the looser circles of Paris--whilesuch, I say, was the conversation in the gaudy triclinium of Lepidus,far different the scene which scowled before the young Athenian.After his condemnation, Glaucus was admitted no more to the gentleguardianship of Sallust, the only friend of his distress.  He was ledalong the forum till the guards stopped at a small door by the side ofthe temple of Jupiter.  You may see the place still.  The door opened inthe centre in a somewhat singular fashion, revolving round on itshinges, as it were, like a modern turnstile, so as only to leave halfthe threshold open at the same time.  Through this narrow aperture theythrust the prisoner, placed before him a loaf and a pitcher of water,and left him to darkness, and, as he thought, to solitude.  So suddenhad been that revolution of fortune which had prostrated him from thepalmy height of youthful pleasure and successful love to the lowestabyss of ignominy, and the horror of a most bloody death, that he couldscarcely convince himself that he was not held in the meshes of somefearful dream.  His elastic and glorious frame had triumphed over apotion, the greater part of which he had fortunately not drained.  Hehad recovered sense and consciousness, but still a dim and mistydepression clung to his nerves and darkened his mind.  His naturalcourage, and the Greek nobility of pride, enabled him to vanquish allunbecoming apprehension, and, in the judgment-court, to face his awfullot with a steady mien and unquailing eye.  But the consciousness ofinnocence scarcely sufficed to support him when the gaze of men nolonger excited his haughty valor, and he was left to loneliness andsilence.  He felt the damps of the dungeon sink chillingly into hisenfeebled frame.  He--the fastidious, the luxurious, the refined--he whohad hitherto braved no hardship and known no sorrow.  Beautiful birdthat he was! why had he left his far and sunny clime--the olive-grovesof his native hills--the music of immemorial streams?  Why had hewantoned on his glittering plumage amidst these harsh and ungenialstrangers, dazzling the eyes with his gorgeous hues, charming the earwith his blithesome song--thus suddenly to be arrested--caged indarkness--a victim and a prey--his gay flights for ever over--his hymnsof gladness for ever stilled!  The poor Athenian! his very faults theexuberance of a gentle and joyous nature, how little had his past careerfitted him for the trials he was destined to undergo!  The hoots of themob, amidst whose plaudits he had so often guided his graceful car andbounding steeds, still rang gratingly in his ear.  The cold and stonyfaces of former friends (the co-mates of merry revels) still rose beforehis eye.  None now were by to soothe, to sustain, the admired, theadulated stranger.  These walls opened but on the dread arena of aviolent and shameful death.  And Ione! of her, too, he had heard naught;no encouraging word, no pitying message; she, too, had forsaken him; shebelieved him guilty--and of what crime?--the murder of a brother!  Heground his teeth--he groaned aloud--and ever and anon a sharp fear shotacross him.  In that fell and fierce delirium which had so unaccountablyseized his soul, which had so ravaged the disordered brain, might henot, indeed, unknowing to himself, have committed the crime of which hewas accused?  Yet, as the thought flashed upon him, it was as suddenlychecked; for, amidst all the darkness of the past, he thought distinctlyto recall the dim grove of Cybele, the upward face of the pale dead, thepause that he had made beside the corpse, and the sudden shock thatfelled him to the earth.  He felt convinced of his innocence; and yetwho, to the latest time, long after his mangled remains were mingledwith the elements, would believe him guiltless, or uphold his fame?  Ashe recalled his interview with Arbaces, and the causes of revenge whichhad been excited in the heart of that dark and fearful man, he could notbut believe that he was the victim of some deep-laid and mysterioussnare--the clue and train of which he was lost in attempting todiscover: and Ione--Arbaces loved her--might his rival\'s success befounded upon his ruin?  That thought cut him more deeply than all; andhis noble heart was more stung by jealousy than appalled by fear.  Againhe groaned aloud.A voice from the recess of the darkness answered that burst of anguish.\'Who (it said) is my companion in this awful hour?  Athenian Glaucus, itis thou?\'\'So, indeed, they called me in mine hour of fortune: they may have othernames for me now.  And thy name, stranger?\'\'Is Olinthus, thy co-mate in the prison as the trial.\'\'What! he whom they call the Atheist?  Is it the injustice of men thathath taught thee to deny the providence of the gods?\'\'Alas!\' answered Olinthus: \'thou, not I, art the true Atheist, for thoudeniest the sole true God--the Unknown One--to whom thy Athenian fatherserected an altar.  It is in this hour that I know my God.  He is with mein the dungeon; His smile penetrates the darkness; on the eve of deathmy heart whispers immortality, and earth recedes from me but to bringthe weary soul nearer unto heaven.\'\'Tell me,\' said Glaucus, abruptly, \'did I not hear thy name coupled withthat of Apaecides in my trial?  Dost thou believe me guilty?\'\'God alone reads the heart! but my suspicion rested not upon thee.\'\'On whom then?\'\'Thy accuser, Arbaces.\'\'Ha! thou cheerest me: and wherefore?\'\'Because I know the man\'s evil breast, and he had cause to fear him whois now dead.\'With that, Olinthus proceeded to inform Glaucus of those details whichthe reader already knows, the conversion of Apaecides, the plan they hadproposed for the detection of the impostures of the Egyptian upon theyouthful weakness of the proselyte.  \'Therefore,\' concluded Olinthus,\'had the deceased encountered Arbaces, reviled his treasons, andthreatened detection, the place, the hour, might have favored the wrathof the Egyptian, and passion and craft alike dictated the fatal blow.\'\'It must have been so!\' cried Glaucus, joyfully.  \'I am happy.\'\'Yet what, O unfortunate! avails to thee now the discovery?  Thou artcondemned and fated; and in thine innocence thou wilt perish.\'\'But I shall know myself guiltless; and in my mysterious madness I hadfearful, though momentary, doubts.  Yet tell me, man of a strange creed,thinkest thou that for small errors, or for ancestral faults, we are forever abandoned and accursed by the powers above, whatever name thouallottest to them?\'\'God is just, and abandons not His creatures for their mere humanfrailty. God is merciful, and curses none but the wicked who repentnot.\'\'Yet it seemeth to me as if, in the divine anger, I had been smitten bya sudden madness, a supernatural and solemn frenzy, wrought not by humanmeans.\'\'There are demons on earth,\' answered the Nazarene, fearfully, \'as wellas there are God and His Son in heaven; and since thou acknowledgest notthe last, the first may have had power over thee.\'Glaucus did not reply, and there was a silence for some minutes. Atlength the Athenian said, in a changed, and soft, and half-hesitatingvoice. \'Christian, believest thou, among the doctrines of thy creed,that the dead live again--that they who have loved here are unitedhereafter--that beyond the grave our good name shines pure from themortal mists that unjustly dim it in the gross-eyed world--and that thestreams which are divided by the desert and the rock meet in the solemnHades, and flow once more into one?\'\'Believe I that, O Athenian No, I do not believe--I know! and it is thatbeautiful and blessed assurance which supports me now.  O Cyllene!\'continued Olinthus, passionately, \'bride of my heart! torn from me inthe first month of our nuptials,\' shall I not see thee yet, and ere manydays be past?  Welcome, welcome death, that will bring me to heaven andthee!\'There was something in this sudden burst of human affection which strucka kindred chord in the soul of the Greek.  He felt, for the first time,a sympathy greater than mere affliction between him and his companion.He crept nearer towards Olinthus; for the Italians, fierce in somepoints, were not unnecessarily cruel in others; they spared the separatecell and the superfluous chain, and allowed the victims of the arena thesad comfort of such freedom and such companionship as the prison wouldafford.\'Yes,\' continued the Christian, with holy fervor, \'the immortality ofthe soul--the resurrection--the reunion of the dead--is the greatprinciple of our creed--the great truth a God suffered death itself toattest and proclaim.  No fabled Elysium--no poetic Orcus--but a pure andradiant heritage of heaven itself, is the portion of the good.\'\'Tell me, then, thy doctrines, and expound to me thy hopes,\' saidGlaucus, earnestly.Olinthus was not slow to obey that prayer; and there--as oftentimes inthe early ages of the Christian creed--it was in the darkness of thedungeon, and over the approach of death, that the dawning Gospel shedits soft and consecrating rays.Chapter XVIIA CHANCE FOR GLAUCUS.THE hours passed in lingering torture over the head of Nydia from thetime in which she had been replaced in her cell.Sosia, as if afraid he should be again outwitted, had refrained fromvisiting her until late in the morning of the following day, and then hebut thrust in the periodical basket of food and wine, and hastilyreclosed the door.  That day rolled on, and Nydia felt herselfpent--barred--inexorably confined, when that day was the judgment-day ofGlaucus, and when her release would have saved him! Yet knowing, almostimpossible as seemed her escape, that the sole chance for the life ofGlaucus rested on her, this young girl, frail, passionate, and acutelysusceptible as she was--resolved not to give way to a despair that woulddisable her from seizing whatever opportunity might occur.  She kept hersenses whenever, beneath the whirl of intolerable thought, they reeledand tottered; nay, she took food and wine that she might sustain herstrength--that she might be prepared!She revolved scheme after scheme of escape, and was forced to dismissall. Yet Sosia was her only hope, the only instrument with which shecould tamper.  He had been superstitious in the desire of ascertainingwhether he could eventually purchase his freedom.  Blessed gods! mighthe not be won by the bribe of freedom itself? was she not nearly richenough to purchase it? Her slender arms were covered with bracelets, thepresents of Ione; and on her neck she yet wore that very chain which, itmay be remembered, had occasioned her jealous quarrel with Glaucus, andwhich she had afterwards promised vainly to wear for ever.  She waitedburningly till Sosia should again appear: but as hour after hour passed,and he came not, she grew impatient.  Every nerve beat with fever; shecould endure the solitude no longer--she groaned, she shriekedaloud--she beat herself against the door. Her cries echoed along thehall, and Sosia, in peevish anger, hastened to see what was the matter,and silence his prisoner if possible.\'Ho! ho! what is this?\' said he, surlily.  \'Young slave, if thouscreamest out thus, we must gag thee again.  My shoulders will smart forit, if thou art heard by my master.\'\'Kind Sosia, chide me not--I cannot endure to be so long alone,\'answered Nydia; \'the solitude appals me.  Sit with me, I pray, a littlewhile.  Nay, fear not that I should attempt to escape; place thy seatbefore the door. Keep thine eye on me--I will not stir from this spot.\'Sosia, who was a considerable gossip himself, was moved by this address.He pitied one who had nobody to talk with--it was his case too; hepitied--and resolved to relieve himself.  He took the hint of Nydia,placed a stool before the door, leant his back against it, and replied:\'I am sure I do not wish to be churlish; and so far as a little innocentchat goes, I have no objection to indulge you.  But mind, no tricks--nomore conjuring!\'\'No, no; tell me, dear Sosia, what is the hour?\'\'It is already evening--the goats are going home.\'\'O gods! how went the trial\'\'Both condemned.\'Nydia repressed the shriek.  \'Well--well, I thought it would be so. Whendo they suffer?\'\'To-morrow, in the amphitheatre.  If it were not for thee, littlewretch, I should be allowed to go with the rest and see it.\'Nydia leant back for some moments.  Nature could endure no more--she hadfainted away.  But Sosia did not perceive it, for it was the dusk ofeve, and he was full of his own privations.  He went on lamenting theloss of so delightful a show, and accusing the injustice of Arbaces forsingling him out from all his fellows to be converted into a gaoler; andere he had half finished, Nydia, with a deep sigh, recovered the senseof life.\'Thou sighest, blind one, at my loss!  Well, that is some comfort.  Solong as you acknowledge how much you cost me, I will endeavor not togrumble.  It is hard to be ill-treated, and yet not pitied.\'\'Sosia, how much dost thou require to make up the purchase of thyfreedom?\'\'How much?  Why, about two thousand sesterces.\'\'The gods be praised! not more?  Seest thou these bracelets and thischain? They are well worth double that sum.  I will give them theeif...\'\'Tempt me not: I cannot release thee.  Arbaces is a severe and awfulmaster. Who knows but I might feed the fishes of the Sarnus Alas! allthe sesterces in the world would not buy me back into life.  Better alive dog than a dead lion.\'\'Sosia, thy freedom!  Think well!  If thou wilt let me out only for onelittle hour!--let me out at midnight--I will return ere to-morrow\'sdawn; nay, thou canst go with me.\'\'No,\' said Sosia, sturdily, \'a slave once disobeyed Arbaces, and he wasnever more heard of.\'\'But the law gives a master no power over the life of a slave.\'\'The law is very obliging, but more polite than efficient.  I know thatArbaces always gets the law on his side.  Besides, if I am once dead,what law can bring me to life again!\'Nydia wrung her hands.  \'Is there no hope, then?\' said she,convulsively.\'None of escape till Arbaces gives the word.\'\'Well, then, said Nydia, quickly, \'thou wilt not, at least, refuse totake a letter for me: thy master cannot kill thee for that.\'\'To whom?\'\'The praetor.\'\'To a magistrate?  No--not I.  I should be made a witness in court, forwhat I know; and the way they cross-examine the slaves is by thetorture.\'\'Pardon: I meant not the praetor--it was a word that escaped meunawares: I meant quite another person--the gay Sallust.\'\'Oh! and what want you with him?\'\'Glaucus was my master; he purchased me from a cruel lord.  He alone hasbeen kind to me.  He is to die.  I shall never live happily if I cannot,in his hour of trial and doom, let him know that one heart is gratefulto him. Sallust is his friend; he will convey my message.\'\'I am sure he will do no such thing.  Glaucus will have enough to thinkof between this and to-morrow without troubling his head about a blindgirl.\'\'Man,\' said Nydia, rising, \'wilt thou become free?  Thou hast the offerin thy power; to-morrow it will be too late.  Never was freedom morecheaply purchased.  Thou canst easily and unmissed leave home: less thanhalf an hour will suffice for thine absence.  And for such a trifle wiltthou refuse liberty?\'Sosia was greatly moved.  It was true that the request was remarkablysilly; but what was that to him?  So much the better.  He could lock thedoor on Nydia, and, if Arbaces should learn his absence, the offence wasvenial, and would merit but a reprimand.  Yet, should Nydia\'s lettercontain something more than what she had said--should it speak of herimprisonment, as he shrewdly conjectured it would do--what then!  Itneed never be known to Arbaces that he had carried the letter.  At theworst the bribe was enormous--the risk light--the temptationirresistible.  He hesitated no longer--he assented to the proposal.\'Give me the trinkets, and I will take the letter.  Yet stay--thou art aslave--thou hast no right to these ornaments--they are thy master\'s.\'\'They were the gifts of Glaucus; he is my master.  What chance hath heto claim them?  Who else will know they are in my possession?\'\'Enough--I will bring thee the papyrus.\'\'No, not papyrus--a tablet of wax and a stilus.\'Nydia, as the reader will have seen, was born of gentle parents. Theyhad done all to lighten her calamity, and her quick intellect secondedtheir exertions.  Despite her blindness, she had therefore acquired inchildhood, though imperfectly, the art to write with the sharp stilusupon waxen tablets, in which her exquisite sense of touch came to heraid.  When the tablets were brought to her, she thus painfully tracedsome words in Greek, the language of her childhood, and which almostevery Italian of the higher ranks was then supposed to know.  Shecarefully wound round the epistle the thread, and covered its knot withwax; and ere she placed it in the hands of Sosia, she thus addressedhim:\'Sosia, I am blind and in prison.  Thou mayst think to deceive me--thoumayst pretend only to take the letter to Sallust--thou mayst not fulfillthy charge: but here I solemnly dedicate thy head to vengeance, thy soulto the infernal powers, if thou wrongest thy trust; and I call upon theeto place thy right hand of faith in mine, and repeat after me thesewords: ""By the ground on which we stand--by the elements which containlife and can curse life--by Orcus, the all-avenging--by the OlympianJupiter, the all-seeing--I swear that I will honestly discharge mytrust, and faithfully deliver into the hands of Sallust this letter!And if I perjure myself in this oath, may the full curses of heaven andhell be wreaked upon me!"" Enough!--I trust thee--take thy reward.  It isalready dark--depart at once.\'\'Thou art a strange girl, and thou hast frightened me terribly; but itis all very natural: and if Sallust is to be found, I give him thisletter as I have sworn.  By my faith, I may have my little peccadilloes!but perjury--no!  I leave that to my betters.\'With this Sosia withdrew, carefully passing the heavy bolt athwartNydia\'s door--carefully locking its wards: and, hanging the key to hisgirdle, he retired to his own den, enveloped himself from head to footin a huge disguising cloak, and slipped out by the back way undisturbedand unseen.The streets were thin and empty.  He soon gained the house of Sallust.The porter bade him leave his letter, and be gone; for Sallust was sogrieved at the condemnation of Glaucus, that he could not on any accountbe disturbed.\'Nevertheless, I have sworn to give this letter into his own hands--doso I must!\' And Sosia, well knowing by experience that Cerberus loves asop, thrust some half a dozen sesterces into the hand of the porter.\'Well, well,\' said the latter, relenting, \'you may enter if you will;but, to tell you the truth, Sallust is drinking himself out of hisgrief.  It is his way when anything disturbs him.  He orders a capitalsupper, the best wine, and does not give over till everything is out ofhis head--but the liquor.\'\'An excellent plan--excellent!  Ah, what it is to be rich!  If I wereSallust, I would have some grief or another every day.  But just say akind word for me with the atriensis--I see him coming.\'Sallust was too sad to receive company; he was too sad, also, to drinkalone; so, as was his wont, he admitted his favorite freedman to hisentertainment, and a stranger banquet never was held.  For ever andanon, the kind-hearted epicure sighed, whimpered, wept outright, andthen turned with double zest to some new dish or his refilled goblet.\'My good fellow,\' said he to his companion, it was a most awfuljudgment--heigho!--it is not bad that kid, eh?  Poor, dearGlaucus!--what a jaw the lion has too!  Ah, ah, ah!\'And Sallust sobbed loudly--the fit was stopped by a counteraction ofhiccups.\'Take a cup of wine,\' said the freedman.\'A thought too cold: but then how cold Glaucus must be!  Shut up thehouse to-morrow--not a slave shall stir forth--none of my people shallhonour that cursed arena--No, no!\'\'Taste the Falernian--your grief distracts you.  By the gods it does--apiece of that cheesecake.\'It was at this auspicious moment that Sosia was admitted to the presenceof the disconsolate carouser.\'Ho--what art thou?\'\'Merely a messenger to Sallust.  I give him this billet from a youngfemale. There is no answer that I know of.  May I withdraw?\'Thus said the discreet Sosia, keeping his face muffled in his cloak, andspeaking with a feigned voice, so that he might not hereafter berecognized.\'By the gods--a pimp!  Unfeeling wretch!--do you not see my sorrows?Go! and the curses of Pandarus with you!\'Sosia lost not a moment in retiring.\'Will you read the letter, Sallust?\' said the freedman.\'Letter!--which letter?\' said the epicure, reeling, for he began to seedouble.  \'A curse on these wenches, say I!  Am I a man to thinkof--(hiccup)--pleasure, when--when--my friend is going to be eat up?\'\'Eat another tartlet.\'\'No, no!  My grief chokes me!\'\'Take him to bed,\' said the freedman; and, Sallust\'s head now decliningfairly on his breast, they bore him off to his cubiculum, stillmuttering lamentations for Glaucus, and imprecations on the unfeelingovertures of ladies of pleasure.Meanwhile Sosia strode indignantly homeward.  \'Pimp, indeed!\' quoth heto himself.  \'Pimp! a scurvy-tongued fellow that Sallust!  Had I beencalled knave, or thief.  I could have forgiven it; but pimp!  Faugh!There is something in the word which the toughest stomach in the worldwould rise against.  A knave is a knave for his own pleasure, and athief a thief for his own profit; and there is something honorable andphilosophical in being a rascal for one\'s own sake: that is doing thingsupon principle--upon a grand scale.  But a pimp is a thing that defilesitself for another--a pipkin that is put on the fire for another man\'spottage! a napkin, that every guest wipes his hands upon! and thescullion says, ""by your leave"" too. A pimp!  I would rather he had calledme parricide!  But the man was drunk, and did not know what he said;and, besides, I disguised myself.  Had he seen it had been Sosia whoaddressed him, it would have been ""honest Sosia!"" and, ""worthy man!"" Iwarrant.  Nevertheless, the trinkets have been won easily--that\'s somecomfort! and, O goddess Feronia!  I shall be a freedman soon! and then Ishould like to see who\'ll call me pimp!--unless, indeed, he pay mepretty handsomely for it!\'While Sosia was soliloquising in this high-minded and generous vein, hispath lay along a narrow lane that led towards the amphitheatre and itsadjacent palaces.  Suddenly, as he turned a sharp corner he foundhimself in the midst of a considerable crowd. Men, women, and children,all were hurrying or laughing, talking, gesticulating; and, ere he wasaware of it, the worthy Sosia was borne away with the noisy stream.\'What now?\' he asked of his nearest neighbor, a young artificer; \'whatnow? Where are all these good folks thronging?\' Does any rich patrongive away alms or viands to-night?\'\'Not so, man--better still,\' replied the artificer; \'the noblePansa--the people\'s friend--has granted the public leave to see thebeasts in their vivaria.  By Hercules! they will not be seen so safelyby some persons to-morrow.\'\'Tis a pretty sight,\' said the slave, yielding to the throng thatimpelled him onward; \'and since I may not go to the sports to-morrow, Imay as well take a peep at the beasts to-night.\'\'You will do well,\' returned his new acquaintance, \'a lion and a tigerare not to be seen at Pompeii every day.\'The crowd had now entered a broken and wide space of ground, on which,as it was only lighted scantily and from a distance, the press becamedangerous to those whose limbs and shoulders were not fitted for a mob.Nevertheless, the women especially--many of them with children in theirarms, or even at the breast--were the most resolute in forcing theirway; and their shrill exclamations of complaint or objurgation wereheard loud above the more jovial and masculine voices.  Yet, amidst themwas a young and girlish voice, that appeared to come from one too happyin her excitement to be alive to the inconvenience of the crowd.\'Aha!\' cried the young woman, to some of her companions, \'I always toldyou so; I always said we should have a man for the lion; and now we haveone for the tiger too!  I wish tomorrow were come!\'       Ho, ho! for the merry, merry show,        With a forest of faces in every row!        Lo! the swordsmen, bold as the son of Alcmaena,        Sweep, side by side, o\'er the hushed arena.        Talk while you may, you will hold your breath        When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death!        Tramp! tramp! how gaily they go!        Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show!\'A jolly girl!\' said Sosia.\'Yes,\' replied the young artificer, a curly-headed, handsome youth.\'Yes,\' replied he, enviously; \'the women love a gladiator.  If I hadbeen a slave, I would have soon found my schoolmaster in the lanista!\'\'Would you, indeed?\' said Sosia, with a sneer.  \'People\'s notionsdiffer!\'The crowd had now arrived at the place of destination; but as the cellin which the wild beasts were confined was extremely small and narrow,tenfold more vehement than it hitherto had been was the rush of theaspirants to obtain admittance.  Two of the officers of theamphitheatre, placed at the entrance, very wisely mitigated the evil bydispensing to the foremost only a limited number of tickets at a time,and admitting no new visitors till their predecessors had sated theircuriosity.  Sosia, who was a tolerably stout fellow and not troubledwith any remarkable scruples of diffidence or good breeding, contrivedto be among the first of the initiated.Separated from his companion the artificer, Sosia found himself in anarrow cell of oppressive heat and atmosphere, and lighted by severalrank and flaring torches.The animals, usually kept in different vivaria, or dens, were now, forthe greater entertainment of the visitors, placed in one, but equallyindeed divided from each other by strong cages protected by iron bars.There they were, the fell and grim wanderers of the desert, who have nowbecome almost the principal agents of this story.  The lion, who, asbeing the more gentle by nature than his fellow-beast, had been moreincited to ferocity by hunger, stalked restlessly and fiercely to andfro his narrow confines: his eyes were lurid with rage and famine: andas, every now and then, he paused and glared around, the spectatorsfearfully pressed backward, and drew their breath more quickly.  But thetiger lay quiet and extended at full length in his cage, and only by anoccasional play of his tail, or a long impatient yawn, testified anyemotion at his confinement, or at the crowd which honored him with theirpresence.\'I have seen no fiercer beast than yon lion even in the amphitheatre ofRome,\' said a gigantic and sinewy fellow who stood at the right hand ofSosia.\'I feel humbled when I look at his limbs,\' replied, at the left ofSosia, a slighter and younger figure, with his arms folded on hisbreast.The slave looked first at one, and then at the other.  \'Virtus inmedio!--virtue is ever in the middle!\' muttered he to himself; \'a goodlyneighborhood for thee, Sosia--a gladiator on each side!\'\'That is well said, Lydon,\' returned the huger gladiator; \'I feel thesame.\'\'And to think,\' observed Lydon, in a tone of deep feeling, \'to think thatthe noble Greek, he whom we saw but a day or two since before us, sofull of youth, and health, and joyousness, is to feast yon monster!\'\'Why not?\' growled Niger, savagely: \'many an honest gladiator has beencompelled to a like combat by the emperor--why not a wealthy murderer bythe law?\'Lydon sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and remained silent. Meanwhile thecommon gazers listened with staring eyes and lips apart: the gladiatorswere objects of interest as well as the beasts--they were animals of thesame species; so the crowd glanced from one to the other--the men andthe brutes--whispering their comments and anticipating the morrow.\'Well!\' said Lydon, turning away, \'I thank the gods that it is not thelion or the tiger I am to contend with; even you, Niger, are a gentlercombatant than they.\'\'But equally dangerous,\' said the gladiator, with a fierce laugh; andthe bystanders, admiring his vast limbs and ferocious countenance,laughed too.\'That as it may be,\' answered Lydon, carelessly, as he pressed throughthe throng and quitted the den.\'I may as well take advantage of his shoulders,\' thought the prudentSosia, hastening to follow him: \'the crowd always give way to agladiator, so I will keep close behind, and come in for a share of hisconsequence.\'The son of Medon strode quickly through the mob, many of whom recognizedhis features and profession.\'That is young Lydon, a brave fellow: he fights to-morrow,\' said one.\'Ah! I have a bet on him,\' said another; \'see how firmly he walks!\'\'Good luck to thee, Lydon!\' said a third.\'Lydon, you have my wishes,\' half whispered a fourth, smiling (a comelywoman of the middle class)--\'and if you win, why, you may hear more ofme.\'\'A handsome man, by Venus!\' cried a fifth, who was a girl scarce in herteens.  \'Thank you,\' returned Sosia, gravely taking the compliment tohimself.However strong the purer motives of Lydon, and certain though it be thathe would never have entered so bloody a calling but from the hope ofobtaining his father\'s freedom, he was not altogether unmoved by thenotice he excited.  He forgot that the voices now raised in commendationmight, on the morrow, shout over his death-pangs.  By nature fierce andreckless, as well as generous and warm-hearted, he was already imbuedwith the pride of a profession that he fancied he disdained, andaffected by the influence of a companionship that in reality he loathed.He saw himself now a man of importance; his step grew yet lighter, andhis mien more elate.\'Niger,\' said he, turning suddenly, as he had now threaded the crowd;\'we have often quarrelled; we are not matched against each other, butone of us, at least, may reasonably expect to fall--give us thy hand.\'\'Most readily,\' said Sosia, extending his palm.\'Ha! what fool is this?  Why, I thought Niger was at my heels!\'\'I forgive the mistake,\' replied Sosia, condescendingly: \'don\'t mentionit; the error was easy--I and Niger are somewhat of the same build.\'\'Ha! ha! that is excellent!  Niger would have slit thy throat had heheard thee!\'\'You gentlemen of the arena have a most disagreeable mode of talking,\'said Sosia; \'let us change the conversation.\'\'Vah! vah!\' said Lydon, impatiently; \'I am in no humor to converse withthee!\'\'Why, truly,\' returned the slave, \'you must have serious thoughts enoughto occupy your mind: to-morrow is, I think, your first essay in thearena. Well, I am sure you will die bravely!\'\'May thy words fall on thine own head!\' said Lydon, superstitiously, forhe by no means liked the blessing of Sosia.  \'Die! No--I trust my houris not yet come.\'\'He who plays at dice with death must expect the dog\'s throw,\' repliedSosia, maliciously.  \'But you are a strong fellow, and I wish you allimaginable luck; and so, vale!\'With that the slave turned on his heel, and took his way homeward.\'I trust the rogue\'s words are not ominous,\' said Lydon, musingly. \'Inmy zeal for my father\'s liberty, and my confidence in my own thews andsinews, I have not contemplated the possibility of death.  My poorfather!  I am thy only son!--if I were to fall...\'As the thought crossed him, the gladiator strode on with a more rapidand restless pace, when suddenly, in an opposite street, he beheld thevery object of his thoughts.  Leaning on his stick, his form bent bycare and age, his eyes downcast, and his steps trembling, thegrey-haired Medon slowly approached towards the gladiator.  Lydon pauseda moment: he divined at once the cause that brought forth the old man atthat late hour.\'Be sure, it is I whom he seeks,\' thought he; \'he is horror struck atthe condemnation of Olinthus--he more than ever esteems the arenacriminal and hateful--he comes again to dissuade me from the contest.  Imust shun him--I cannot brook his prayers--his tears.\'These thoughts, so long to recite, flashed across the young man likelightning.  He turned abruptly and fled swiftly in an oppositedirection. He paused not till, almost spent and breathless, he foundhimself on the summit of a small acclivity which overlooked the most gayand splendid part of that miniature city; and as there he paused, andgazed along the tranquil streets glittering in the rays of the moon(which had just arisen, and brought partially and picturesquely intolight the crowd around the amphitheatre at a distance, murmuring, andswaying to and fro), the influence of the scene affected him, rude andunimaginative though his nature.  He sat himself down to rest upon thesteps of a deserted portico, and felt the calm of the hour quiet andrestore him.  Opposite and near at hand, the lights gleamed from apalace in which the master now held his revels.  The doors were open forcoolness, and the gladiator beheld the numerous and festive groupgathered round the tables in the atrium; while behind them, closing thelong vista of the illumined rooms beyond, the spray of the distantfountain sparkled in the moonbeams. There, the garlands wreathed aroundthe columns of the hall--there, gleamed still and frequent the marblestatue--there, amidst peals of jocund laughter, rose the music and thelay.              EPICUREAN SONG       Away with your stories of Hades,          Which the Flamen has forged to affright us--       We laugh at your three Maiden Ladies,          Your Fates--and your sullen Cocytus.       Poor Jove has a troublesome life, sir,          Could we credit your tales of his portals--       In shutting his ears on his wife, sir,          And opening his eyes upon mortals.       Oh, blest be the bright Epicurus!          Who taught us to laugh at such fables;        On Hades they wanted to moor us,          And his hand cut the terrible cables.       If, then, there\'s a Jove or a Juno,          They vex not their heads about us, man;        Besides, if they did, I and you know          \'Tis the life of a god to live thus, man!       What! think you the gods place their bliss--eh?--         In playing the spy on a sinner?        In counting the girls that we kiss, eh?          Or the cups that we empty at dinner?       Content with the soft lips that love us,          This music, this wine, and this mirth, boys,        We care not for gods up above us--         We know there\'s no god for this earth, boys!While Lydon\'s piety (which accommodating as it might be, was in noslight degree disturbed by these verses, which embodied the fashionablephilosophy of the day) slowly recovered itself from the shock it hadreceived, a small party of men, in plain garments and of the middleclass, passed by his resting-place.  They were in earnest conversation,and did not seem to notice or heed the gladiator as they moved on.\'O horror on horrors!\' said one; \'Olinthus is snatched from us! ourright arm is lopped away!  When will Christ descend to protect his own?\'\'Can human atrocity go farther,\' said another: \'to sentence an innocentman to the same arena as a murderer!  But let us not despair; thethunder of Sinai may yet be heard, and the Lord preserve his saint.""The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.""\'At that moment out broke again, from the illumined palace, the burden ofthe reveller\'s song:--    We care not for gods up above us--       We know there\'s no god for this earth, boys!Ere the words died away, the Nazarenes, moved by sudden indignation,caught up the echo, and, in the words of one of their favorite hymns,shouted aloud:--        THE WARNING HYMN OF THE NAZARENES       Around--about--for ever near thee,        God--OUR GOD--shall mark and hear thee!        On his car of storm He sweeps!        Bow, ye heavens, and shrink, ye deeps!        Woe to the proud ones who defy Him!--       Woe to the dreamers who deny Him!            Woe to the wicked, woe!          The proud stars shall fail--         The sun shall grow pale--       The heavens shrivel up like a scroll--         Hell\'s ocean shall bare          Its depths of despair,        Each wave an eternal soul!          For the only thing, then,          That shall not live again            Is the corpse of the giant TIME.           Hark, the trumpet of thunder!           Lo, earth rent asunder!         And, forth, on His Angel-throne,           He comes through the gloom,           The Judge of the Tomb,         To summon and save His own!              Oh, joy to Care, and woe to Crime,              He comes to save His own!        Woe to the proud ones who defy Him!        Woe to the dreamers who deny Him!              Woe to the wicked, woe!A sudden silence from the startled hall of revel succeeded these ominouswords: the Christians swept on, and were soon hidden from the sight ofthe gladiator.  Awed, he scarce knew why, by the mystic denunciations ofthe Christians, Lydon, after a short pause, now rose to pursue his wayhomeward.Before him, how serenely slept the starlight on that lovely city! howbreathlessly its pillared streets reposed in their security!--how softlyrippled the dark-green waves beyond!--how cloudless spread, aloft andblue, the dreaming Campanian skies!  Yet this was the last night for thegay Pompeii! the colony of the hoar Chaldean! the fabled city ofHercules! the delight of the voluptuous Roman!  Age after age hadrolled, indestructive, unheeded, over its head; and now the last rayquivered on the dial-plate of its doom!  The gladiator heard some lightsteps behind--a group of females were wending homeward from their visitto the amphitheatre.  As he turned, his eye was arrested by a strangeand sudden apparition.  From the summit of Vesuvius, darkly visible atthe distance, there shot a pale, meteoric, livid light--it trembled aninstant and was gone.  And at the same moment that his eye caught it,the voice of one of the youngest of the women broke out hilariously andshrill:--       TRAMP! TRAMP! HOW GAILY THEY GO!        HO, HO! FOR THE MORROW\'S MERRY SHOW!BOOK THE FIFTHChapter ITHE DREAM OF ARBACES.  A VISITOR AND A WARNING TO THE EGYPTIAN.THE awful night preceding the fierce joy of the amphitheatre rolleddrearily away, and greyly broke forth the dawn of THE LAST DAY OFPOMPEII!  The air was uncommonly calm and sultry--a thin and dull mistgathered over the valleys and hollows of the broad Campanian fields.But yet it was remarked in surprise by the early fishermen, that,despite the exceeding stillness of the atmosphere, the waves of the seawere agitated, and seemed, as it were, to run disturbedly back from theshore; while along the blue and stately Sarnus, whose ancient breadth ofchannel the traveler now vainly seeks to discover, there crept a hoarseand sullen murmur, as it glided by the laughing plains and the gaudyvillas of the wealthy citizens.  Clear above the low mist rose thetime-worn towers of the immemorial town, the red-tiled roofs of thebright streets, the solemn columns of many temples, and thestatue-crowned portals of the Forum and the Arch of Triumph.  Far in thedistance, the outline of the circling hills soared above the vapors, andmingled with the changeful hues of the morning sky.  The cloud that hadso long rested over the crest of Vesuvius had suddenly vanished, and itsrugged and haughty brow looked without a frown over the beautiful scenesbelow.Despite the earliness of the hour, the gates of the city were alreadyopened.  Horsemen upon horsemen, vehicle after vehicle, poured rapidlyin; and the voices of numerous pedestrian groups, clad in holidayattire, rose high in joyous and excited merriment; the streets werecrowded with citizens and strangers from the populous neighborhood ofPompeii; and noisily--fast--confusedly swept the many streams of lifetowards the fatal show.Despite the vast size of the amphitheatre, seemingly so disproportionedto the extent of the city, and formed to include nearly the wholepopulation of Pompeii itself, so great, on extraordinary occasions, wasthe concourse of strangers from all parts of Campania, that the spacebefore it was usually crowded for several hours previous to thecommencement of the sports, by such persons as were not entitled bytheir rank to appointed and special seats.  And the intense curiositywhich the trial and sentence of two criminals so remarkable hadoccasioned, increased the crowd on this day to an extent whollyunprecedented.While the common people, with the lively vehemence of their Campanianblood, were thus pushing, scrambling, hurrying on--yet, amidst all theireagerness, preserving, as is now the wont with Italians in suchmeetings, a wonderful order and unquarrelsome good humor, a strangevisitor to Arbaces was threading her way to his sequestered mansion.  Atthe sight of her quaint and primaeval garb--of her wild gait andgestures--the passengers she encountered touched each other and smiled;but as they caught a glimpse of her countenance, the mirth was hushed atonce, for the face was as the face of the dead; and, what with theghastly features and obsolete robes of the stranger, it seemed as if onelong entombed had risen once more amongst the living.  In silence andawe each group gave way as she passed along, and she soon gained thebroad porch of the Egyptian\'s palace.The black porter, like the rest of the world, astir at an unusual hour,started as he opened the door to her summons.The sleep of the Egyptian had been usually profound during the night;but, as the dawn approached, it was disturbed by strange and unquietdreams, which impressed him the more as they were colored by thepeculiar philosophy he embraced.He thought that he was transported to the bowels of the earth, and thathe stood alone in a mighty cavern supported by enormous columns of roughand primaeval rock, lost, as they ascended, in the vastness of a shadowathwart whose eternal darkness no beam of day had ever glanced.  And inthe space between these columns were huge wheels, that whirled round andround unceasingly, and with a rushing and roaring noise.  Only to theright and left extremities of the cavern, the space between the pillarswas left bare, and the apertures stretched away into galleries--notwholly dark, but dimly lighted by wandering and erratic fires, that,meteor-like, now crept (as the snake creeps) along the rugged and danksoil; and now leaped fiercely to and fro, darting across the vast gloomin wild gambols--suddenly disappearing, and as suddenly bursting intotenfold brilliancy and power.  And while he gazed wonderingly upon thegallery to the left, thin, mist-like, aerial shapes passed slowly up;and when they had gained the hall they seemed to rise aloft, and tovanish, as the smoke vanishes, in the measureless ascent.He turned in fear towards the opposite extremity--and behold! there cameswiftly, from the gloom above, similar shadows, which swept hurriedlyalong the gallery to the right, as if borne involuntarily adown thesides of some invisible stream; and the faces of these spectres weremore distinct than those that emerged from the opposite passage; and onsome was joy, and on others sorrow--some were vivid with expectation andhope, some unutterably dejected by awe and horror.  And so they passed,swift and constantly on, till the eyes of the gazer grew dizzy andblinded with the whirl of an ever-varying succession of things impelledby a power apparently not their own.Arbaces turned away, and, in the recess of the hall, he saw the mightyform of a giantess seated upon a pile of skulls, and her hands were busyupon a pale and shadowy woof; and he saw that the woof communicated withthe numberless wheels, as if it guided the machinery of their movements.He thought his feet, by some secret agency, were impelled towards thefemale, and that he was borne onwards till he stood before her, face toface.  The countenance of the giantess was solemn and hushed, andbeautifully serene. It was as the face of some colossal sculpture of hisown ancestral sphinx. No passion--no human emotion, disturbed itsbrooding and unwrinkled brow: there was neither sadness, nor joy, normemory, nor hope: it was free from all with which the wild human heartcan sympathize.  The mystery of mysteries rested on its beauty--it awed,but terrified not: it was the Incarnation of the sublime.  And Arbacesfelt the voice leave his lips, without an impulse of his own; and thevoice asked:\'Who art thou, and what is thy task?\'\'I am That which thou hast acknowledged,\' answered, without desistingfrom its work, the mighty phantom.  \'My name is NATURE!  These are thewheels of the world, and my hand guides them for the life of allthings.\'\'And what,\' said the voice of Arbaces, \'are these galleries, thatstrangely and fitfully illumined, stretch on either hand into the abyssof gloom?\'\'That,\' answered the giant-mother, \'which thou beholdest to the left, isthe gallery of the Unborn.  The shadows that flit onward and upward intothe world, are the souls that pass from the long eternity of being totheir destined pilgrimage on earth.  That which thou beholdest to thyright, wherein the shadows descending from above sweep on, equallyunknown and dim, is the gallery of the Dead!\'\'And wherefore, said the voice of Arbaces, \'yon wandering lights, thatso wildly break the darkness; but only break, not reveal?\'\'Dark fool of the human sciences! dreamer of the stars, and would-bedecipherer of the heart and origin of things! those lights are but theglimmerings of such knowledge as is vouchsafed to Nature to work herway, to trace enough of the past and future to give providence to herdesigns. Judge, then, puppet as thou art, what lights are reserved forthee!\'Arbaces felt himself tremble as he asked again, \'Wherefore am I here?\'\'It is the forecast of thy soul--the prescience of thy rushing doom--theshadow of thy fate lengthening into eternity as declines from earth.\'Ere he could answer, Arbaces felt a rushing WIND sweep down the cavern,as the winds of a giant god.  Borne aloft from the ground, and whirledon high as a leaf in the storms of autumn, he beheld himself in themidst of the Spectres of the Dead, and hurrying with them along thelength of gloom.  As in vain and impotent despair he struggled againstthe impelling power, he thought the WIND grew into something like ashape--a spectral outline of the wings and talons of an eagle, withlimbs floating far and indistinctly along the air, and eyes that, aloneclearly and vividly seen, glared stonily and remorselessly on his own.\'What art thou?\' again said the voice of the Egyptian.\'I am That which thou hast acknowledged\'; and the spectre laughedaloud--\'and my name is NECESSITY.\'\'To what dost thou bear me?\'\'To the Unknown.\'\'To happiness or to woe?\'\'As thou hast sown, so shalt thou reap.\'\'Dread thing, not so!  If thou art the Ruler of Life, thine are mymisdeeds, not mine.\'\'I am but the breath of God!\' answered the mighty WIND.\'Then is my wisdom vain!\' groaned the dreamer.\'The husbandman accuses not fate, when, having sown thistles, he reapsnot corn.  Thou hast sown crime, accuse not fate if thou reapest not theharvest of virtue.\'The scene suddenly changed.  Arbaces was in a place of human bones; andlo! in the midst of them was a skull, and the skull, still retaining itsfleshless hollows, assumed slowly, and in the mysterious confusion of adream, the face of Apaecides; and forth from the grinning jaws therecrept a small worm, and it crawled to the feet of Arbaces.  He attemptedto stamp on it and crush it; but it became longer and larger with thatattempt.  It swelled and bloated till it grew into a vast serpent: itcoiled itself round the limbs of Arbaces; it crunched his bones; itraised its glaring eyes and poisonous jaws to his face.  He writhed invain; he withered--he gasped--beneath the influence of the blightingbreath--he felt himself blasted into death. And then a voice came fromthe reptile, which still bore the face of Apaecides and rang in hisreeling ear:\'THY VICTIM IS THY JUDGE!  THE WORM THOU WOULDST CRUSH BECOMES THESERPENT THAT DEVOURS THEE!\'With a shriek of wrath, and woe, and despairing resistance, Arbacesawoke--his hair on end--his brow bathed in dew--his eyes glazed andstaring--his mighty frame quivering as an infant\'s, beneath the agony ofthat dream.  He awoke--he collected himself--he blessed the gods whom hedisbelieved, that he was in a dream--he turned his eyes from side toside--he saw the dawning light break through his small but loftywindow--he was in the Precincts of Day--he rejoiced--he smiled; his eyesfell, and opposite to him he beheld the ghastly features, the lifelesseye, the livid lip--of the hag of Vesuvius!\'Ha!\' he cried, placing his hands before his eyes, as to shut out thegrisly vision, \'do I dream still?--Am I with the dead?\'\'Mighty Hermes--no!  Thou art with one death-like, but not dead.Recognize thy friend and slave.\'There was a long silence.  Slowly the shudders that passed over thelimbs of the Egyptian chased each other away, faintlier and faintlierdying till he was himself again.\'It was a dream, then,\' said he.  \'Well--let me dream no more, or theday cannot compensate for the pangs of night.  Woman, how camest thouhere, and wherefore?\'\'I came to warn thee,\' answered the sepulchral voice of the saga.\'Warn me!  The dream lied not, then?  Of what peril?\'\'Listen to me.  Some evil hangs over this fated city.  Fly while it betime. Thou knowest that I hold my home on that mountain beneath whichold tradition saith there yet burn the fires of the river of Phlegethon;and in my cavern is a vast abyss, and in that abyss I have of latemarked a red and dull stream creep slowly, slowly on; and heard many andmighty sounds hissing and roaring through the gloom.  But last night, asI looked thereon, behold the stream was no longer dull, but intenselyand fiercely luminous; and while I gazed, the beast that liveth with me,and was cowering by my side, uttered a shrill howl, and fell down anddied, and the slaver and froth were round his lips.  I crept back to mylair; but I distinctly heard, all the night, the rock shake and tremble;and, though the air was heavy and still, there were the hissing of pentwinds, and the grinding as of wheels, beneath the ground.  So, when Irose this morning at the very birth of dawn, I looked again down theabyss, and I saw vast fragments of stone borne black and floatingly overthe lurid stream; and the stream itself was broader, fiercer, redderthan the night before.  Then I went forth, and ascended to the summit ofthe rock: and in that summit there appeared a sudden and vast hollow,which I had never perceived before, from which curled a dim, faintsmoke; and the vapor was deathly, and I gasped, and sickened, and nearlydied.  I returned home.  I took my gold and my drugs, and left thehabitation of many years; for I remembered the dark Etruscan prophecywhich saith, ""When the mountain opens, the city shall fall--when thesmoke crowns the Hill of the Parched Fields, there shall be woe andweeping in the hearths of the Children of the Sea."" Dread master, ere Ileave these walls for some more distant dwelling, I come to thee.  Asthou livest, know I in my heart that the earthquake that sixteen yearsago shook this city to its solid base, was but the forerunner of moredeadly doom.  The walls of Pompeii are built above the fields of theDead, and the rivers of the sleepless Hell.  Be warned and fly!\'\'Witch, I thank thee for thy care of one not ungrateful.  On yon tablestands a cup of gold; take it, it is thine.  I dreamt not that therelived one, out of the priesthood of Isis, who would have saved Arbacesfrom destruction.  The signs thou hast seen in the bed of the extinctvolcano,\' continued the Egyptian, musingly, \'surely tell of some comingdanger to the city; perhaps another earthquake--fiercer than the last.Be that as it may, there is a new reason for my hastening from thesewalls.  After this day I will prepare my departure.  Daughter ofEtruria, whither wendest thou?\'\'I shall cross over to Herculaneum this day, and, wandering thence alongthe coast, shall seek out a new home.  I am friendless: my twocompanions, the fox and the snake, are dead.  Great Hermes, thou hastpromised me twenty additional years of life!\'\'Aye,\' said the Egyptian, \'I have promised thee.  But, woman,\' he added,lifting himself upon his arm, and gazing curiously on her face, \'tellme, I pray thee, wherefore thou wishest to live?  What sweets dost thoudiscover in existence?\'\'It is not life that is sweet, but death that is awful,\' replied thehag, in a sharp, impressive tone, that struck forcibly upon the heart ofthe vain star-seer.  He winced at the truth of the reply; and no longeranxious to retain so uninviting a companion, he said, \'Time wanes; Imust prepare for the solemn spectacle of this day. Sister, farewell!enjoy thyself as thou canst over the ashes of life.\'The hag, who had placed the costly gift of Arbaces in the loose folds ofher vest, now rose to depart.  When she had gained the door she paused,turned back, and said, \'This may be the last time we meet on earth; butwhither flieth the flame when it leaves the ashes?--Wandering to andfro, up and down, as an exhalation on the morass, the flame may be seenin the marshes of the lake below; and the witch and the Magian, thepupil and the master, the great one and the accursed one, may meetagain.  Farewell!\'\'Out, croaker!\' muttered Arbaces, as the door closed on the hag\'stattered robes; and, impatient of his own thoughts, not yet recoveredfrom the past dream, he hastily summoned his slaves.It was the custom to attend the ceremonials of the amphitheatre infestive robes, and Arbaces arrayed himself that day with more than usualcare.  His tunic was of the most dazzling white: his many fibulae wereformed from the most precious stones: over his tunic flowed a looseeastern robe, half-gown, half-mantle, glowing in the richest hues of theTyrian dye; and the sandals, that reached half way up the knee, werestudded with gems, and inlaid with gold.  In the quackeries thatbelonged to his priestly genius, Arbaces never neglected, on greatoccasions, the arts which dazzle and impose upon the vulgar; and on thisday, that was for ever to release him, by the sacrifice of Glaucus, fromthe fear of a rival and the chance of detection, he felt that he wasarraying himself as for a triumph or a nuptial feast.It was customary for men of rank to be accompanied to the shows of theamphitheatre by a procession of their slaves and freedmen; and the long\'family\' of Arbaces were already arranged in order, to attend the litterof their lord.Only, to their great chagrin, the slaves in attendance on Ione, and theworthy Sosia, as gaoler to Nydia, were condemned to remain at home.\'Callias,\' said Arbaces, apart to his freedman, who was buckling on hisgirdle, \'I am weary of Pompeii; I propose to quit it in three days,should the wind favor.  Thou knowest the vessel that lies in the harborwhich belonged to Narses, of Alexandria; I have purchased it of him.The day after tomorrow we shall begin to remove my stores.\'\'So soon!  \'Tis well.  Arbaces shall be obeyed--and his ward, Ione?\'\'Accompanies me.  Enough!--Is the morning fair?\'\'Dim and oppressive; it will probably be intensely hot in the forenoon.\'\'The poor gladiators, and more wretched criminals!  Descend, and seethat the slaves are marshalled.\'Left alone, Arbaces stepped into his chamber of study, and thence uponthe portico without.  He saw the dense masses of men pouring fast intothe amphitheatre, and heard the cry of the assistants, and the crackingof the cordage, as they were straining aloft the huge awning under whichthe citizens, molested by no discomforting ray, were to behold, atluxurious ease, the agonies of their fellow creatures.  Suddenly a wildstrange sound went forth, and as suddenly died away--it was the roar ofthe lion.  There was a silence in the distant crowd; but the silence wasfollowed by joyous laughter--they were making merry at the hungryimpatience of the royal beast.\'Brutes!\' muttered the disdainful, \'Arbaces are ye less homicides than Iam? I slay but in self-defence--ye make murder pastime.\'He turned with a restless and curious eye, towards Vesuvius. Beautifullyglowed the green vineyards round its breast, and tranquil as eternitylay in the breathless skies the form of the mighty hill.\'We have time yet, if the earthquake be nursing,\' thought Arbaces; andhe turned from the spot.  He passed by the table which bore his mysticscrolls and Chaldean calculations.\'August art!\' he thought, \'I have not consulted thy decrees since Ipassed the danger and the crisis they foretold.  What matter?--I knowthat henceforth all in my path is bright and smooth. Have not eventsalready proved it?  Away, doubt--away, pity!  Reflect O my heart--reflect, for the future, but two images--Empire and Ione!\'Chapter IITHE AMPHITHEATRE.NYDIA, assured by the account of Sosia, on his return home, andsatisfied that her letter was in the hands of Sallust, gave herself uponce more to hope.  Sallust would surely lose no time in seeking thepraetor--in coming to the house of the Egyptian--in releasing her--inbreaking the prison of Calenus.  That very night Glaucus would be free.Alas! the night passed--the dawn broke; she heard nothing but thehurried footsteps of the slaves along the hall and peristyle, and theirvoices in preparation for the show.  By-and-by, the commanding voice ofArbaces broke on her ear--a flourish of music rung out cheerily: thelong procession were sweeping to the amphitheatre to glut their eyes onthe death-pangs of the Athenian!The procession of Arbaces moved along slowly, and with much solemnitytill now, arriving at the place where it was necessary for such as camein litters or chariots to alight, Arbaces descended from his vehicle,and proceeded to the entrance by which the more distinguished spectatorswere admitted.  His slaves, mingling with the humbler crowd, werestationed by officers who received their tickets (not much unlike ourmodern Opera ones), in places in the popularia (the seats apportioned tothe vulgar).  And now, from the spot where Arbaces sat, his eyes scannedthe mighty and impatient crowd that filled the stupendous theatre.On the upper tier (but apart from the male spectators) sat women, theirgay dresses resembling some gaudy flower-bed; it is needless to add thatthey were the most talkative part of the assembly; and many were thelooks directed up to them, especially from the benches appropriated tothe young and the unmarried men.  On the lower seats round the arena satthe more high-born and wealthy visitors--the magistrates and those ofsenatorial or equestrian dignity; the passages which, by corridors atthe right and left, gave access to these seats, at either end of theoval arena, were also the entrances for the combatants.  Strong palingsat these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the movementsof the beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey.  Around theparapet which was raised above the arena, and from which the seatsgradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and paintings wrought infresco, typical of the entertainments for which the place was designed.Throughout the whole building wound invisible pipes, from which, as theday advanced, cooling and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over thespectators.  The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in thetask of fixing the vast awning (or velaria) which covered the whole, andwhich luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to themselves: it waswoven of the whitest Apulian wool, and variegated with broad stripes ofcrimson.  Owing either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen,or to some defect in the machinery, the awning, however, was notarranged that day so happily as usual; indeed, from the immense space ofthe circumference, the task was always one of great difficulty andart--so much so, that it could seldom be adventured in rough or windyweather.  But the present day was so remarkably still that there seemedto the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers; andwhen a large gap in the back of the awning was still visible, from theobstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with therest, the murmurs of discontent were loud and general.The aedile Pansa, at whose expense the exhibition was given, lookedparticularly annoyed at the defect, and, vowed bitter vengeance on thehead of the chief officer of the show, who, fretting, puffing,perspiring, busied himself in idle orders and unavailing threats.The hubbub ceased suddenly--the operators desisted--the crowd werestilled--the gap was forgotten--for now, with a loud and warlikeflourish of trumpets, the gladiators, marshalled in ceremoniousprocession, entered the arena.  They swept round the oval space veryslowly and deliberately, in order to give the spectators full leisure toadmire their stern serenity of feature--their brawny limbs and variousarms, as well as to form such wagers as the excitement of the momentmight suggest.\'Oh!\' cried the widow Fulvia to the wife of Pansa, as they leaned downfrom their lofty bench, \'do you see that gigantic gladiator? how drollyhe is dressed!\'\'Yes,\' said the aedile\'s wife, with complacent importance, for she knewall the names and qualities of each combatant; \'he is a retiarius ornetter; he is armed only, you see, with a three-pronged spear like atrident, and a net; he wears no armor, only the fillet and the tunic.He is a mighty man, and is to fight with Sporus, yon thick-setgladiator, with the round shield and drawn sword, but without bodyarmor; he has not his helmet on now, in order that you may see hisface--how fearless it is!--by-and-by he will fight with his vizor down.\'\'But surely a net and a spear are poor arms against a shield and sword?\'\'That shows how innocent you are, my dear Fulvia; the retiarius hasgenerally the best of it.\'\'But who is yon handsome gladiator, nearly naked--is it not quiteimproper? By Venus! but his limbs are beautifully shaped!\'\'It is Lydon, a young untried man! he has the rashness to fight yonother gladiator similarly dressed, or rather undressed--Tetraides. Theyfight first in the Greek fashion, with the cestus; afterwards they puton armor, and try sword and shield.\'\'He is a proper man, this Lydon; and the women, I am sure, are on hisside.\'\'So are not the experienced betters; Clodius offers three to one againsthim!\'\'Oh, Jove! how beautiful!\' exclaimed the widow, as two gladiators, armedcap-a-pie, rode round the arena on light and prancing steeds. Resemblingmuch the combatants in the tilts of the middle age, they bore lances andround shields beautifully inlaid: their armor was woven intricately withbands of iron, but it covered only the thighs and the right arms; shortcloaks, extending to the seat, gave a picturesque and graceful air totheir costume; their legs were naked, with the exception of sandals,which were fastened a little above the ankle.  \'Oh, beautiful!  Who arethese?\' asked the widow.\'The one is named Berbix--he has conquered twelve times; the otherassumes the arrogant name of Nobilior.  They are both Gauls.\'While thus conversing, the first formalities of the show were over.  Tothese succeeded a feigned combat with wooden swords between the variousgladiators matched against each other.  Amongst these, the skill of twoRoman gladiators, hired for the occasion, was the most admired; and nextto them the most graceful combatant was Lydon.  This sham contest didnot last above an hour, nor did it attract any very lively interest,except among those connoisseurs of the arena to whom art was preferableto more coarse excitement; the body of the spectators were rejoiced whenit was over, and when the sympathy rose to terror.  The combatants werenow arranged in pairs, as agreed beforehand; their weapons examined; andthe grave sports of the day commenced amidst the deepest silence--brokenonly by an exciting and preliminary blast of warlike music.It was often customary to begin the sports by the most cruel of all, andsome bestiarius, or gladiator appointed to the beasts, was slain first,as an initiatory sacrifice.  But in the present instance, theexperienced Pansa thought it better that the sanguinary drama shouldadvance, not decrease, in interest and, accordingly, the execution ofOlinthus and Glaucus was reserved for the last.  It was arranged thatthe two horsemen should first occupy the arena; that the footgladiators, paired off, should then be loosed indiscriminately on thestage; that Glaucus and the lion should next perform their part in thebloody spectacle; and the tiger and the Nazarene be the grand finale.And, in the spectacles of Pompeii, the reader of Roman history mustlimit his imagination, nor expect to find those vast and wholesaleexhibitions of magnificent slaughter with which a Nero or a Caligularegaled the inhabitants of the Imperial City.  The Roman shows, whichabsorbed the more celebrated gladiators, and the chief proportion offoreign beasts, were indeed the very reason why, in the lesser towns ofthe empire, the sports of the amphitheatre were comparatively humane andrare; and in this, as in other respects, Pompeii was but the miniature,the microcosm of Rome.  Still, it was an awful and imposing spectacle,with which modern times have, happily, nothing to compare--a vasttheatre, rising row upon row, and swarming with human beings, fromfifteen to eighteen thousand in number, intent upon no fictitiousrepresentation--no tragedy of the stage--but the actual victory ordefeat, the exultant life or the bloody death, of each and all whoentered the arena!The two horsemen were now at either extremity of the lists (if so theymight be called); and, at a given signal from Pansa, the combatantsstarted simultaneously as in full collision, each advancing his roundbuckler, each poising on high his light yet sturdy javelin; but justwhen within three paces of his opponent, the steed of Berbix suddenlyhalted, wheeled round, and, as Nobilior was borne rapidly by, hisantagonist spurred upon him.  The buckler of Nobilior, quickly andskillfully extended, received a blow which otherwise would have beenfatal.\'Well done, Nobilior!\' cried the praetor, giving the first vent to thepopular excitement.\'Bravely struck, my Berbix!\' answered Clodius from his seat.And the wild murmur, swelled by many a shout, echoed from side to side.The vizors of both the horsemen were completely closed (like those ofthe knights in after times), but the head was, nevertheless, the greatpoint of assault; and Nobilior, now wheeling his charger with no lessadroitness than his opponent, directed his spear full on the helmet ofhis foe.  Berbix raised his buckler to shield himself, and hisquick-eyed antagonist, suddenly lowering his weapon, pierced him throughthe breast.  Berbix reeled and fell.\'Nobilior! Nobilior!\' shouted the populace.\'I have lost ten sestertia,\' said Clodius, between his teeth.\'Habet!--he has it,\' said Pansa, deliberately.The populace, not yet hardened into cruelty, made the signal of mercy;but as the attendants of the arena approached, they found the kindnesscame too late--the heart of the Gaul had been pierced, and his eyes wereset in death.  It was his life\'s blood that flowed so darkly over thesand and sawdust of the arena.\'It is a pity it was so soon over--there was little enough for one\'strouble,\' said the widow Fulvia.\'Yes--I have no compassion for Berbix.  Any one might have seen thatNobilior did but feint.  Mark, they fix the fatal hook to the body--theydrag him away to the spoliarium--they scatter new sand over the stage!Pansa regrets nothing more than that he is not rich enough to strew thearena with borax and cinnabar, as Nero used to do.\'\'Well, if it has been a brief battle, it is quickly succeeded.  See myhandsome Lydon on the arena--ay--and the net-bearer too, and theswordsmen! oh, charming!\'There were now on the arena six combatants: Niger and his net, matchedagainst Sporus with his shield and his short broadsword; Lydon andTetraides, naked save by a cincture round the waist, each armed onlywith a heavy Greek cestus--and two gladiators from Rome, clad incomplete steel, and evenly matched with immense bucklers and pointedswords.The initiatory contest between Lydon and Tetraides being less deadlythan that between the other combatants, no sooner had they advanced tothe middle of the arena than, as by common consent, the rest held back,to see how that contest should be decided, and wait till fiercer weaponsmight replace the cestus, ere they themselves commenced hostilities.They stood leaning on their arms and apart from each other, gazing onthe show, which, if not bloody enough, thoroughly to please thepopulace, they were still inclined to admire, because its origin was oftheir ancestral Greece.No person could, at first glance, have seemed less evenly matched thanthe two antagonists.  Tetraides, though not taller than Lydon, weighedconsiderably more; the natural size of his muscles was increased, to theeyes of the vulgar, by masses of solid flesh; for, as it was a notionthat the contest of the cestus fared easiest with him who was plumpest,Tetraides had encouraged to the utmost his hereditary predisposition tothe portly. His shoulders were vast, and his lower limbs thick-set,double-jointed, and slightly curved outward, in that formation whichtakes so much from beauty to give so largely to strength.  But Lydon,except that he was slender even almost to meagreness, was beautifullyand delicately proportioned; and the skilful might have perceived that,with much less compass of muscle than his foe, that which he had wasmore seasoned--iron and compact.  In proportion, too, as he wantedflesh, he was likely to possess activity; and a haughty smile on hisresolute face which strongly contrasted the solid heaviness of hisenemy\'s, gave assurance to those who beheld it, and united their hope totheir pity: so that, despite the disparity of their seeming strength,the cry of the multitude was nearly as loud for Lydon as for Tetraides.Whoever is acquainted with the modern prize-ring--whoever has witnessedthe heavy and disabling strokes which the human fist, skillfullydirected, hath the power to bestow--may easily understand how much thathappy facility would be increased by a band carried by thongs of leatherround the arm as high as the elbow, and terribly strengthened about theknuckles by a plate of iron, and sometimes a plummet of lead.  Yet this,which was meant to increase, perhaps rather diminished, the interest ofthe fray: for it necessarily shortened its duration.  A very few blows,successfully and scientifically planted, might suffice to bring thecontest to a close; and the battle did not, therefore, often allow fullscope for the energy, fortitude and dogged perseverance, that wetechnically style pluck, which not unusually wins the day againstsuperior science, and which heightens to so painful a delight theinterest in the battle and the sympathy for the brave.\'Guard thyself!\' growled Tetraides, moving nearer and nearer to his foe,who rather shifted round him than receded.Lydon did not answer, save by a scornful glance of his quick, vigilanteye. Tetraides struck--it was as the blow of a smith on a vice; Lydonsank suddenly on one knee--the blow passed over his head.  Not soharmless was Lydon\'s retaliation: he quickly sprung to his feet, andaimed his cestus full on the broad breast of his antagonist.  Tetraidesreeled--the populace shouted.\'You are unlucky to-day,\' said Lepidus to Clodius: \'you have lost onebet----you will lose another.\'\'By the gods! my bronzes go to the auctioneer if that is the case. Ihave no less than a hundred sestertia upon Tetraides.  Ha, ha! see howhe rallies! That was a home stroke: he has cut open Lydon\'s shoulder.  ATetraides!--a Tetraides!\'\'But Lydon is not disheartened.  By Pollux! how well he keeps histemper. See how dexterously he avoids those hammer-like hands!--dodgingnow here, now there--circling round and round.  Ah, poor Lydon! he hasit again.\'\'Three to one still on Tetraides!  What say you, Lepidus?\'\'Well, nine sestertia to three--be it so!  What! again, Lydon?  Hestops--he gasps for breath.  By the gods, he is down.  No--he is againon his legs. Brave Lydon! Tetraides is encouraged--he laughs loud--herushes on him.\'\'Fool--success blinds him--he should be cautious.  Lydon\'s eye is likethe lynx\'s,\' said Clodius, between his teeth.\'Ha, Clodius! saw you that?  Your man totters!  Another blow--hefalls--he falls!\'\'Earth revives him, then.  He is once more up; but the blood rolls downhis face.\'\'By the thunderer! Lydon wins it.  See how he presses on him! That blowon the temple would have crushed an ox! it has crushed Tetraides.  Hefalls again--he cannot move--habet!--habet!\'\'Habet!\' repeated Pansa.  \'Take them out and give them the armor andswords.\'\'Noble editor,\' said the officers, \'we fear that Tetraides will notrecover in time; howbeit, we will try.\'\'Do so.\'In a few minutes the officers, who had dragged off the stunned andinsensible gladiator, returned with rueful countenances.  They fearedfor his life; he was utterly incapacitated from re-entering the arena.\'In that case,\' said Pansa, \'hold Lydon a subdititius; and the firstgladiator that is vanquished, let Lydon supply his place with thevictor.\' The people shouted their applause at this sentence: then theyagain sunk into deep silence.  The trumpet sounded loudly. The fourcombatants stood each against each in prepared and stern array.\'Dost thou recognize the Romans, my Clodius; are they among thecelebrated, or are they merely ordinary?\'\'Eumolpus is a good second-rate swordsman, my Lepidus.  Nepimus, thelesser man, I have never seen before: but he is the son of one of theimperial fiscales, and brought up in a proper school; doubtless theywill show sport, but I have no heart for the game; I cannot win back mymoney--I am undone. Curses on that Lydon! who could have supposed he wasso dexterous or so lucky?\'\'Well, Clodius, shall I take compassion on you, and accept your ownterms with these Romans?\'\'An even ten sestertia on Eumolpus, then?\'\'What! when Nepimus is untried?  Nay, nay; that is to bad.\'\'Well--ten to eight?\'\'Agreed.\'While the contest in the amphitheatre had thus commenced, there was onein the loftier benches for whom it had assumed, indeed, a poignant--astifling interest.  The aged father of Lydon, despite his Christianhorror of the spectacle, in his agonized anxiety for his son, had notbeen able to resist being the spectator of his fate. One amidst a fiercecrowd of strangers--the lowest rabble of the populace--the old man saw,felt nothing, but the form--the presence of his brave son!  Not a soundhad escaped his lips when twice he had seen him fall to the earth--onlyhe had turned paler, and his limbs trembled.  But he had uttered one lowcry when he saw him victorious; unconscious, alas! of the more fearfulbattle to which that victory was but a prelude.\'My gallant boy!\' said he, and wiped his eyes.\'Is he thy son?\' said a brawny fellow to the right of the Nazarene; \'hehas fought well: let us see how he does by-and-by.  Hark! he is to fightthe first victor.  Now, old boy, pray the gods that that victor beneither of the Romans! nor, next to them, the giant Niger.\'The old man sat down again and covered his face.  The fray for themoment was indifferent to him--Lydon was not one of the combatants.Yet--yet--the thought flashed across him--the fray was indeed of deadlyinterest--the first who fell was to make way for Lydon!  He started, andbent down, with straining eyes and clasped hands, to view the encounter.The first interest was attracted towards the combat of Niger withSporus; for this species of contest, from the fatal result which usuallyattended it, and from the great science it required in eitherantagonist, was always peculiarly inviting to the spectators.They stood at a considerable distance from each other.  The singularhelmet which Sporus wore (the vizor of which was down) concealed hisface; but the features of Niger attracted a fearful and universalinterest from their compressed and vigilant ferocity. Thus they stoodfor some moments, each eyeing each, until Sporus began slowly, and withgreat caution, to advance, holding his sword pointed, like a modernfencer\'s, at the breast of his foe. Niger retreated as his antagonistadvanced, gathering up his net with his right hand, and never taking hissmall glittering eye from the movements of the swordsman.  Suddenly whenSporus had approached nearly at arm\'s length, the retiarius threwhimself forward, and cast his net.  A quick inflection of body saved thegladiator from the deadly snare! he uttered a sharp cry of joy and rage,and rushed upon Niger: but Niger had already drawn in his net, thrown itacross his shoulders, and now fled round the lists with a swiftnesswhich the secutor in vain endeavored to equal.  The people laughed andshouted aloud, to see the ineffectual efforts of the broad-shoulderedgladiator to overtake the flying giant: when, at that moment, theirattention was turned from these to the two Roman combatants.They had placed themselves at the onset face to face, at the distance ofmodern fencers from each other: but the extreme caution which bothevinced at first had prevented any warmth of engagement, and allowed thespectators full leisure to interest themselves in the battle betweenSporus and his foe.  But the Romans were now heated into full and fierceencounter: they pushed--returned--advanced on--retreated from each otherwith all that careful yet scarcely perceptible caution whichcharacterizes men well experienced and equally matched.  But at thismoment, Eumolpus, the elder gladiator, by that dexterous back-strokewhich was considered in the arena so difficult to avoid, had woundedNepimus in the side.  The people shouted; Lepidus turned pale.\'Ho!\' said Clodius, \'the game is nearly over.  If Eumolpus fights nowthe quiet fight, the other will gradually bleed himself away.\'\'But, thank the gods! he does not fight the backward fight. See!--hepresses hard upon Nepimus.  By Mars! but Nepimus had him there! thehelmet rang again!--Clodius, I shall win!\'\'Why do I ever bet but at the dice?\' groaned Clodius to himself;--or whycannot one cog a gladiator?\'\'A Sporus!--a Sporus!\' shouted the populace, as Niger having nowsuddenly paused, had again cast his net, and again unsuccessfully. Hehad not retreated this time with sufficient agility--the sword of Sporushad inflicted a severe wound upon his right leg; and, incapacitated tofly, he was pressed hard by the fierce swordsman.  His great height andlength of arm still continued, however, to give him no despicableadvantages; and steadily keeping his trident at the front of his foe, herepelled him successfully for several minutes. Sporus now tried, bygreat rapidity of evolution, to get round his antagonist, whonecessarily moved with pain and slowness.  In so doing, he lost hiscaution--he advanced too near to the giant--raised his arm to strike,and received the three points of the fatal spear full in his breast!  Hesank on his knee.  In a moment more, the deadly net was cast over him,he struggled against its meshes in vain; again--again--again he writhedmutely beneath the fresh strokes of the trident--his blood flowed fastthrough the net and redly over the sand.  He lowered his arms inacknowledgment of defeat.The conquering retiarius withdrew his net, and leaning on his spear,looked to the audience for their judgement.  Slowly, too, at the samemoment, the vanquished gladiator rolled his dim and despairing eyesaround the theatre. From row to row, from bench to bench, there glaredupon him but merciless and unpitying eyes.Hushed was the roar--the murmur!  The silence was dread, for it was nosympathy; not a hand--no, not even a woman\'s hand--gave the signal ofcharity and life!  Sporus had never been popular in the arena; and,lately, the interest of the combat had been excited on behalf of thewounded Niger. The people were warmed into blood--the mimic fight hadceased to charm; the interest had mounted up to the desire of sacrificeand the thirst of death!The gladiator felt that his doom was sealed: he uttered no prayer--nogroan. The people gave the signal of death!  In dogged but agonizedsubmission, he bent his neck to receive the fatal stroke.  And now, asthe spear of the retiarius was not a weapon to inflict instant andcertain death, there stalked into the arena a grim and fatal form,brandishing a short, sharp sword, and with features utterly concealedbeneath its vizor.  With slow and measured steps, this dismal headsmanapproached the gladiator, still kneeling--laid the left hand on hishumbled crest--drew the edge of the blade across his neck--turned roundto the assembly, lest, in the last moment, remorse should come uponthem; the dread signal continued the same: the blade glittered brightlyin the air--fell--and the gladiator rolled upon the sand; his limbsquivered--were still--he was a corpse.\'His body was dragged at once from the arena through the gate of death,and thrown into the gloomy den termed technically the spoliarium.  Andere it had well reached that destination, the strife between theremaining combatants was decided.  The sword of Eumolpus had inflictedthe death-wound upon the less experienced combatant.  A new victim wasadded to the receptacle of the slain.Throughout that mighty assembly there now ran a universal movement; thepeople breathed more freely, and resettled themselves in their seats.  Agrateful shower was cast over every row from the concealed conduits.  Incool and luxurious pleasure they talked over the late spectacle ofblood. Eumolpus removed his helmet, and wiped his brows; hisclose-curled hair and short beard, his noble Roman features and brightdark eye attracted the general admiration.  He was fresh, unwounded,unfatigued.The editor paused, and proclaimed aloud that, as Niger\'s wound disabledhim from again entering the arena, Lydon was to be the successor to theslaughtered Nepimus, and the new combatant of Eumolpus.\'Yet, Lydon,\' added he, \'if thou wouldst decline the combat with one sobrave and tried, thou mayst have full liberty to do so. Eumolpus is notthe antagonist that was originally decreed for thee. Thou knowest besthow far thou canst cope with him.  If thou failest, thy doom ishonorable death; if thou conquerest, out of my own purse I will doublethe stipulated prize.\'The people shouted applause.  Lydon stood in the lists, he gazed around;high above he beheld the pale face, the straining eyes, of his father.He turned away irresolute for a moment.  No! the conquest of the cestuswas not sufficient--he had not yet won the prize of victory--his fatherwas still a slave!\'Noble aedile!\' he replied, in a firm and deep tone, \'I shrink not fromthis combat.  For the honour of Pompeii, I demand that one trained byits long-celebrated lanista shall do battle with this Roman.\'The people shouted louder than before.\'Four to one against Lydon!\' said Clodius to Lepidus.\'I would not take twenty to one!  Why, Eumolpus is a very Achilles, andthis poor fellow is but a tyro!\'Eumolpus gazed hard on the face of Lydon; he smiled; yet the smile wasfollowed by a slight and scarce audible sigh--a touch of compassionateemotion, which custom conquered the moment the heart acknowledged it.And now both, clad in complete armor, the sword drawn, the vizor closed,the two last combatants of the arena (ere man, at least, was matchedwith beast), stood opposed to each other.It was just at this time that a letter was delivered to the proctor byone of the attendants of the arena; he removed the cincture--glancedover it for a moment--his countenance betrayed surprise andembarrassment.  He re-read the letter, and then muttering--\'Tush! it isimpossible!--the man must be drunk, even in the morning, to dream ofsuch follies!\'--threw it carelessly aside, and gravely settled himselfonce more in the attitude of attention to the sports.The interest of the public was wound up very high.  Eumolpus had atfirst won their favor; but the gallantry of Lydon, and his well-timedallusion to the honour of the Pompeian lanista, had afterwards given thelatter the preference in their eyes.\'Holla, old fellow!\' said Medon\'s neighbor to him.  \'Your son is hardlymatched; but never fear, the editor will not permit him to be slain--no,nor the people neither; he has behaved too bravely for that.  Ha! thatwas a home thrust!--well averted, by Pollux!  At him again, Lydon!--theystop to breathe.  What art thou muttering, old boy\'Prayers!\' answered Medon, with a more calm and hopeful mien than he hadyet maintained.\'Prayers!--trifles!  The time for gods to carry a man away in a cloud isgone now.  Ha! Jupiter! what a blow!  Thy side--thy side!--take care ofthy side, Lydon!\'There was a convulsive tremor throughout the assembly.  A fierce blowfrom Eumolpus, full on the crest, had brought Lydon to his knee.\'Habet!--he has it!\' cried a shrill female voice; \'he has it!\' It wasthe voice of the girl who had so anxiously anticipated the sacrifice ofsome criminal to the beasts.\'Be silent, child!\' said the wife of Pansa, haughtily.  \'Non habet!--heis not wounded!\'\'I wish he were, if only to spite old surly Medon,\' muttered the girl.Meanwhile Lydon, who had hitherto defended himself with great skill andvalor, began to give way before the vigorous assaults of the practisedRoman; his arm grew tired, his eye dizzy, he breathed hard andpainfully. The combatants paused again for breath.\'Young man,\' said Eumolpus, in a low voice, \'desist; I will wound theeslightly--then lower thy arms; thou hast propitiated the editor and themob--thou wilt be honorably saved!\'\'And my father still enslaved!\' groaned Lydon to himself.  \'No! death orhis freedom.\'At that thought, and seeing that, his strength not being equal to theendurance of the Roman, everything depended on a sudden and desperateeffort, he threw himself fiercely on Eumolpus; the Roman warilyretreated--Lydon thrust again--Eumolpus drew himself aside--the swordgrazed his cuirass--Lydon\'s breast was exposed--the Roman plunged hissword through the joints of the armor, not meaning, however, to inflicta deep wound; Lydon, weak and exhausted, fell forward, fell right on thepoint: it passed through and through, even to the back.  Eumolpus drewforth his blade; Lydon still made an effort to regain his balance--hissword left his grasp--he struck mechanically at the gladiator with hisnaked hand, and fell prostrate on the arena.  With one accord, editorand assembly made the signal of mercy--the officers of the arenaapproached--they took off the helmet of the vanquished.  He stillbreathed; his eyes rolled fiercely on his foe; the savageness he hadacquired in his calling glared from his gaze, and lowered upon the browdarkened already with the shades of death; then, with a convulsivegroan, with a half start, he lifted his eyes above.  They rested not onthe face of the editor nor on the pitying brows of his relenting judges.He saw them not; they were as if the vast space was desolate and bare;one pale agonizing face alone was all he recognized--one cry of a brokenheart was all that, amidst the murmurs and the shouts of the populace,reached his ear.  The ferocity vanished from his brow; a soft, a tenderexpression of sanctifying but despairing love played over hisfeatures--played--waned--darkened!  His face suddenly became locked andrigid, resuming its former fierceness.  He fell upon the earth.\'Look to him,\' said the aedile; \'he has done his duty!\'The officers dragged him off to the spoliarium.\'A true type of glory, and of its fate!\' murmured Arbaces to himself,and his eye, glancing round the amphitheatre, betrayed so much ofdisdain and scorn, that whoever encountered it felt his breath suddenlyarrested, and his emotions frozen into one sensation of abasement and ofawe.Again rich perfumes were wafted around the theatre; the attendantssprinkled fresh sand over the arena.\'Bring forth the lion and Glaucus the Athenian,\' said the editor.And a deep and breathless hush of overwrought interest, and intense(yet, strange to say, not unpleasing) terror lay, like a mighty andawful dream, over the assembly.Chapter IIISALLUST AND NYDIA\'S LETTER.THRICE had Sallust awakened from his morning sleep, and thrice,recollecting that his friend was that day to perish, had he turnedhimself with a deep sigh once more to court oblivion.  His sole objectin life was to avoid pain; and where he could not avoid, at least toforget it.At length, unable any longer to steep his consciousness in slumber, heraised himself from his incumbent posture, and discovered his favoritefreedman sitting by his bedside as usual; for Sallust, who, as I havesaid, had a gentlemanlike taste for the polite letters, was accustomedto be read to for an hour or so previous to his rising in the morning.\'No books to-day! no more Tibullus! no more Pindar for me!  Pindar!alas, alas! the very name recalls those games to which our arena is thesavage successor.  Has it begun--the amphitheatre? are its ritescommenced?\'\'Long since, O Sallust!  Did you not hear the trumpets and the tramplingfeet?\'\'Ay, ay; but the gods be thanked, I was drowsy, and had only to turnround to fall asleep again.\'\'The gladiators must have been long in the ring.\'\'The wretches!  None of my people have gone to the spectacle?\'\'Assuredly not; your orders were too strict.\'\'That is well--would the day were over!  What is that letter yonder onthe table?\'\'That!  Oh, the letter brought to you last night, when youwere--too--too...\'\'Drunk to read it, I suppose.  No matter, it cannot be of muchimportance.\'\'Shall I open it for you, Sallust,\'\'Do: anything to divert my thoughts.  Poor Glaucus!\'The freedman opened the letter.  \'What! Greek?\' said he, \'some learnedlady, I suppose.\' He glanced over the letter, and for some moments theirregular lines traced by the blind girl\'s hand puzzled him.  Suddenly,however, his countenance exhibited emotion and surprise.  \'Good gods!noble Sallust! what have we done not to attend to this before?  Hear meread!\'\'""Nydia, the slave, to Sallust, the friend of Glaucus!  I am a prisonerin the house of Arbaces.  Hasten to the praetor! procure my release, andwe shall yet save Glaucus from the lion.  There is another prisonerwithin these walls, whose witness can exonerate the Athenian from thecharge against him--one who saw the crime--who can prove the criminal ina villain hitherto unsuspected.  Fly! hasten! quick! quick!  Bring withyou armed men, lest resistance be made, and a cunning and dexteroussmith; for the dungeon of my fellow-prisoner is thick and strong.  Oh!by thy right hand and thy father\'s ashes, lose not a moment!""\'\'Great Jove!\' exclaimed Sallust, starting, \'and this day--nay, withinthis hour, perhaps, he dies.  What is to be done?  I will instantly tothe praetor.\'\'Nay; not so.  The praetor (as well as Pansa, the editor himself) is thecreature of the mob; and the mob will not hear of delay; they will notbe balked in the very moment of expectation.  Besides, the publicity ofthe appeal would forewarn the cunning Egyptian.  It is evident that hehas some interest in these concealments.  No; fortunately thy slaves arein thy house.\'\'I seize thy meaning,\' interrupted Sallust: \'arm the slaves instantly.The streets are empty.  We will ourselves hasten to the house ofArbaces, and release the prisoners.  Quick! quick!  What ho! Davusthere!  My gown and sandals, the papyrus and a reed.\' I will write tothe praetor, to beseech him to delay the sentence of Glaucus, for that,within an hour, we may yet prove him innocent.  So, so, that is well.Hasten with this, Davus, to the praetor, at the amphitheatre.  See itgiven to his own hand.  Now then, O ye gods! whose providence Epicurusdenied, befriend me, and I will call Epicurus a liar!\'Chapter IVTHE AMPHITHEATRE ONCE MORE.GLAUCUS and Olinthus had been placed together in that gloomy and narrowcell in which the criminals of the arena awaited their last and fearfulstruggle. Their eyes, of late accustomed to the darkness, scanned thefaces of each other in this awful hour, and by that dim light, thepaleness, which chased away the natural hues from either cheek, assumeda yet more ashy and ghastly whiteness.  Yet their brows were erect anddauntless--their limbs did not tremble--their lips were compressed andrigid.  The religion of the one, the pride of the other, the consciousinnocence of both, and, it may be, the support derived from their mutualcompanionship, elevated the victim into the hero.\'Hark! hearest thou that shout They are growling over their humanblood,\' said Olinthus.\'I hear; my heart grows sick; but the gods support me.\'\'The gods!  O rash young man!  in this hour recognize only the One God.Have I not taught thee in the dungeon, wept for thee, prayed forthee?--in my zeal and in my agony, have I not thought more of thysalvation than my own?\'\'Brave friend!\' answered Glaucus, solemnly, \'I have listened to theewith awe, with wonder, and with a secret tendency towards conviction.Had our lives been spared, I might gradually have weaned myself from thetenets of my own faith, and inclined to thine; but, in this last hour itwere a craven thing, and a base, to yield to hasty terror what shouldonly be the result of lengthened meditation.  Were I to embrace thycreed, and cast down my father\'s gods, should I not be bribed by thypromise of heaven, or awed by thy threats of hell? Olinthus, no!  Thinkwe of each other with equal charity--I honoring thy sincerity--thoupitying my blindness or my obdurate courage.  As have been my deeds,such will be my reward; and the Power or Powers above will not judgeharshly of human error, when it is linked with honesty of purpose andtruth of heart.  Speak we no more of this.  Hush! Dost thou hear themdrag yon heavy body through the passage?  Such as that clay will be ourssoon.\'\'O Heaven!  O Christ! already I behold ye!\' cried the fervent Olinthus,lifting up his hands; \'I tremble not--I rejoice that the prison-houseshall be soon broken.\'Glaucus bowed his head in silence.  He felt the distinction between hisfortitude and that of his fellow-sufferer.  The heathen did not tremble;but the Christian exulted.The door swung gratingly back--the gleam of spears shot along the walls.\'Glaucus the Athenian, thy time has come,\' said a loud and clear voice;\'the lion awaits thee.\'\'I am ready,\' said the Athenian.  \'Brother and co-mate, one lastembrace! Bless me--and farewell!\'The Christian opened his arms--he clasped the young heathen to hisbreast--he kissed his forehead and cheek--he sobbed aloud--his tearsflowed fast and hot over the features of his new friend.\'Oh! could I have converted thee, I had not wept.  Oh! that I might sayto thee, ""We two shall sup this night in Paradise!""\'\'It may be so yet,\' answered the Greek, with a tremulous voice. \'Theywhom death part not, may meet yet beyond the grave: on the earth--on thebeautiful, the beloved earth, farewell for ever!--Worthy officer, Iattend you.\'Glaucus tore himself away; and when he came forth into the air, itsbreath, which, though sunless, was hot and arid, smote witheringly uponhim.  His frame, not yet restored from the effects of the deadlydraught, shrank and trembled.  The officers supported him.\'Courage!\' said one; \'thou art young, active, well knit.  They give theea weapon! despair not, and thou mayst yet conquer.\'Glaucus did not reply; but, ashamed of his infirmity, he made adesperate and convulsive effort, and regained the firmness of hisnerves.  They anointed his body, completely naked, save by a cinctureround the loins, placed the stilus (vain weapon!) in his hand, and ledhim into the arena.And now when the Greek saw the eyes of thousands and tens of thousandsupon him, he no longer felt that he was mortal.  All evidence offear--all fear itself--was gone.  A red and haughty flush spread overthe paleness of his features--he towered aloft to the full of hisglorious stature.  In the elastic beauty of his limbs and form, in hisintent but unfrowning brow, in the high disdain, and in the indomitablesoul, which breathed visibly, which spoke audibly, from his attitude,his lip, his eye--he seemed the very incarnation, vivid and corporeal,of the valor of his land--of the divinity of its worship--at once a heroand a god!The murmur of hatred and horror at his crime, which had greeted hisentrance, died into the silence of involuntary admiration andhalf-compassionate respect; and with a quick and convulsive sigh, thatseemed to move the whole mass of life as if it were one body, the gazeof the spectators turned from the Athenian to a dark uncouth object inthe centre of the arena.  It was the grated den of the lion!\'By Venus, how warm it is!\' said Fulvia; \'yet there is no sun. Wouldthat those stupid sailors could have fastened up that gap in theawning!\'\'Oh! it is warm, indeed.  I turn sick--I faint!\' said the wife of Pansa;even her experienced stoicism giving way at the struggle about to takeplace.The lion had been kept without food for twenty-four hours, and theanimal had, during the whole morning, testified a singular and restlessuneasiness, which the keeper had attributed to the pangs of hunger.  Yetits bearing seemed rather that of fear than of rage; its roar waspainful and distressed; it hung its head--snuffed the air through thebars--then lay down--started again--and again uttered its wild andfar-resounding cries. And now, in its den, it lay utterly dumb and mute,with distended nostrils forced hard against the grating, and disturbingwith a heaving breath, the sand below on the arena.The editor\'s lip quivered, and his cheek grew pale; he looked anxiouslyaround--hesitated--delayed; the crowd became impatient. Slowly he gavethe sign; the keeper, who was behind the den, cautiously removed thegrating, and the lion leaped forth with a mighty and glad roar ofrelease.  The keeper hastily retreated through the grated passageleading from the arena, and left the lord of the forest--and his prey.Glaucus had bent his limbs so as to give himself the firmest posture atthe expected rush of the lion, with his small and shining weapon raisedon high, in the faint hope that one well-directed thrust (for he knewthat he should have time but for one) might penetrate through the eye tothe brain of his grim foe.But, to the unutterable astonishment of all, the beast seemed not evenaware of the presence of the criminal.At the first moment of its release it halted abruptly in the arena,raised itself half on end, snuffing the upward air with impatient sighs;then suddenly it sprang forward, but not on the Athenian.  At half-speedit circled round and round the space, turning its vast head from side toside with an anxious and perturbed gaze, as if seeking only some avenueof escape; once or twice it endeavored to leap up the parapet thatdivided it from the audience, and, on failing, uttered rather a baffledhowl than its deep-toned and kingly roar.  It evinced no sign, either ofwrath or hunger; its tail drooped along the sand, instead of lashing itsgaunt sides; and its eye, though it wandered at times to Glaucus, rolledagain listlessly from him.  At length, as if tired of attempting toescape, it crept with a moan into its cage, and once more laid itselfdown to rest.The first surprise of the assembly at the apathy of the lion soon grewconverted into resentment at its cowardice; and the populace alreadymerged their pity for the fate of Glaucus into angry compassion fortheir own disappointment.The editor called to the keeper.\'How is this?  Take the goad, prick him forth, and then close the doorof the den.\'As the keeper, with some fear, but more astonishment, was preparing toobey, a loud cry was heard at one of the entrances of the arena; therewas a confusion, a bustle--voices of remonstrance suddenly breakingforth, and suddenly silenced at the reply.  All eyes turned in wonder atthe interruption, towards the quarter of the disturbance; the crowd gaveway, and suddenly Sallust appeared on the senatorial benches, his hairdisheveled--breathless--heated--half-exhausted.  He cast his eyeshastily round the ring.  \'Remove the Athenian,\' he cried; \'haste--he isinnocent! Arrest Arbaces the Egyptian--HE is the murderer of Apaecides!\'\'Art thou mad, O Sallust!\' said the praetor, rising from his seat. \'Whatmeans this raving?\'\'Remove the Athenian!--Quick! or his blood be on your head. Praetor,delay, and you answer with your own life to the emperor!  I bring withme the eye-witness to the death of the priest Apaecides. Roomthere!--stand back!--give way!  People of Pompeii, fix every eye uponArbaces--there he sits!  Room there for the priest Calenus!\'Pale, haggard, fresh from the jaws of famine and of death, his facefallen, his eyes dull as a vulture\'s, his broad frame gaunt as askeleton--Calenus was supported into the very row in which Arbaces sat.His releasers had given him sparingly of food; but the chief sustenancethat nerved his feeble limbs was revenge!\'The priest Calenus!--Calenus!\' cried the mob.  \'Is it he?  No--it is adead man?\'\'It is the priest Calenus,\' said the praetor, gravely.  \'What hast thouto say?\'\'Arbaces of Egypt is the murderer of Apaecides, the priest of Isis;these eyes saw him deal the blow.  It is from the dungeon into which heplunged me--it is from the darkness and horror of a death byfamine--that the gods have raised me to proclaim his crime!  Release theAthenian--he is innocent!\'\'It is for this, then, that the lion spared him.  A miracle! a miracle!\'cried Pansa.\'A miracle; a miracle!\' shouted the people; \'remove theAthenian--Arbaces to the lion!\'And that shout echoed from hill to vale--from coast to sea--\'Arbaces tothe lion!\'Officers, remove the accused Glaucus--remove, but guard him yet,\' saidthe praetor.  \'The gods lavish their wonders upon this day.\'As the praetor gave the word of release, there was a cry of joy--afemale voice--a child\'s voice--and it was of joy!  It rang through theheart of the assembly with electric force--it, was touching, it washoly, that child\'s voice!  And the populace echoed it back withsympathizing congratulation!\'Silence!\' said the grave praetor--\'who is there?\'\'The blind girl--Nydia,\' answered Sallust; \'it is her hand that hasraised Calenus from the grave, and delivered Glaucus from the lion.\'\'Of this hereafter,\' said the praetor.  \'Calenus, priest of Isis, thouaccusest Arbaces of the murder of Apaecides?\'\'I do.\'\'Thou didst behold the deed?\'\'Praetor--with these eyes...\'\'Enough at present--the details must be reserved for more suiting timeand place.  Arbaces of Egypt, thou hearest the charge against thee--thouhast not yet spoken--what hast thou to say.The gaze of the crowd had been long riveted on Arbaces: but not untilthe confusion which he had betrayed at the first charge of Sallust andthe entrance of Calenus had subsided.  At the shout, \'Arbaces to thelion!\' he had indeed trembled, and the dark bronze of his cheek hadtaken a paler hue. But he had soon recovered his haughtiness andself-control.  Proudly he returned the angry glare of the countless eyesaround him; and replying now to the question of the praetor, he said, inthat accent so peculiarly tranquil and commanding, which characterizedhis tones:\'Praetor, this charge is so mad that it scarcely deserves reply. Myfirst accuser is the noble Sallust--the most intimate friend of Glaucus!my second is a priest; I revere his garb and calling--but, people ofPompeii! ye know somewhat of the character of Calenus--he is griping andgold-thirsty to a proverb; the witness of such men is to be bought!Praetor, I am innocent!\'\'Sallust,\' said the magistrate, \'where found you Calenus?\'\'In the dungeons of Arbaces.\'\'Egyptian,\' said the praetor, frowning, \'thou didst, then, dare toimprison a priest of the gods--and wherefore?\'\'Hear me,\' answered Arbaces, rising calmly, but with agitation visiblein his face.  \'This man came to threaten that he would make against methe charge he has now made, unless I would purchase his silence withhalf my fortune: I remonstrated--in vain.  Peace there--let not thepriest interrupt me!  Noble praetor--and ye, O people!  I was a strangerin the land--I knew myself innocent of crime--but the witness of apriest against me might yet destroy me.  In my perplexity I decoyed himto the cell whence he has been released, on pretence that it was thecoffer-house of my gold.  I resolved to detain him there until the fateof the true criminal was sealed, and his threats could avail no longer;but I meant no worse.  I may have erred--but who amongst ye will notacknowledge the equity of self-preservation?  Were I guilty, why was thewitness of this priest silent at the trial?--then I had not detained orconcealed him.  Why did he not proclaim my guilt when I proclaimed thatof Glaucus? Praetor, this needs an answer.  For the rest, I throw myselfon your laws.  I demand their protection.  Remove hence the accused andthe accuser.  I will willingly meet, and cheerfully abide by, thedecision of the legitimate tribunal.  This is no place for furtherparley.\'\'He says right,\' said the praetor.  \'Ho! guards--remove Arbaces--guardCalenus!  Sallust, we hold you responsible for your accusation. Let thesports be resumed.\'\'What!\' cried Calenus, turning round to the people, \'shall Isis be thuscontemned?  Shall the blood of Apaecides yet cry for vengeance? Shalljustice be delayed now, that it may be frustrated hereafter? Shall thelion be cheated of his lawful prey?  A god! a god!--I feel the god rushto my lips!  To the lion--to the lion with Arbaces!\'His exhausted frame could support no longer the ferocious malice of thepriest; he sank on the ground in strong convulsions--the foam gatheredto his mouth--he was as a man, indeed, whom a supernatural power hadentered! The people saw and shuddered.\'It is a god that inspires the holy man!  To the lion with theEgyptian!\'With that cry up sprang--on moved--thousands upon thousands! They rushedfrom the heights--they poured down in the direction of the Egyptian.  Invain did the aedile command--in vain did the praetor lift his voice andproclaim the law.  The people had been already rendered savage by theexhibition of blood--they thirsted for more--their superstition wasaided by their ferocity.  Aroused--inflamed by the spectacle of theirvictims, they forgot the authority of their rulers.  It was one of thosedread popular convulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant, half freeand half servile; and which the peculiar constitution of the Romanprovinces so frequently exhibited.  The power of the praetor was as areed beneath the whirlwind; still, at his word the guards had drawnthemselves along the lower benches, on which the upper classes satseparate from the vulgar.  They made but a feeble barrier--the waves ofthe human sea halted for a moment, to enable Arbaces to count the exactmoment of his doom!  In despair, and in a terror which beat down evenpride, he glanced his eyes over the rolling and rushing crowd--when,right above them, through the wide chasm which had been left in thevelaria, he beheld a strange and awful apparition--he beheld--and hiscraft restored his courage!He stretched his hand on high; over his lofty brow and royal featuresthere came an expression of unutterable solemnity and command.\'Behold!\' he shouted with a voice of thunder, which stilled the roar ofthe crowd; \'behold how the gods protect the guiltless!  The fires of theavenging Orcus burst forth against the false witness of my accusers!\'The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian, and beheld,with ineffable dismay, a vast vapor shooting from the summit ofVesuvius, in the form of a gigantic pine-tree; the trunk, blackness--thebranches, fire!--a fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with everymoment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red, that againblazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare!There was a dead, heart-sunken silence--through which there suddenlybroke the roar of the lion, which was echoed back from within thebuilding by the sharper and fiercer yells of its fellow-beast. Dreadseers were they of the Burden of the Atmosphere, and wild prophets ofthe wrath to come!Then there arose on high the universal shrieks of women; the men staredat each other, but were dumb.  At that moment they felt the earth shakebeneath their feet; the walls of the theatre trembled: and, beyond inthe distance, they heard the crash of falling roofs; an instant more andthe mountain-cloud seemed to roll towards them, dark and rapid, like atorrent; at the same time, it cast forth from its bosom a shower ofashes mixed with vast fragments of burning stone!  Over the crushingvines--over the desolate streets--over the amphitheatre itself--far andwide--with many a mighty splash in the agitated sea--fell that awfulshower!No longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces; safety forthemselves was their sole thought.  Each turned to fly--each dashing,pressing, crushing, against the other.  Trampling recklessly over thefallen--amidst groans, and oaths, and prayers, and sudden shrieks, theenormous crowd vomited itself forth through the numerous passages.Whither should they fly? Some, anticipating a second earthquake,hastened to their homes to load themselves with their more costly goods,and escape while it was yet time; others, dreading the showers of ashesthat now fell fast, torrent upon torrent, over the streets, rushed underthe roofs of the nearest houses, or temples, or sheds--shelter of anykind--for protection from the terrors of the open air.  But darker, andlarger, and mightier, spread the cloud above them.  It was a sudden andmore ghastly Night rushing upon the realm of Noon!Chapter VTHE CELL OF THE PRISONER AND THE DEN OF THE DEAD.  GRIEF UNCONSCIOUS OFHORROR.STUNNED by his reprieve, doubting that he was awake, Glaucus had beenled by the officers of the arena into a small cell within the walls ofthe theatre. They threw a loose robe over his form, and crowded round incongratulation and wonder.  There was an impatient and fretful crywithout the cell; the throng gave way, and the blind girl, led by somegentler hand, flung herself at the feet of Glaucus.\'It is I who have saved thee,\' she sobbed; \'now let me die!\'\'Nydia, my child!--my preserver!\'\'Oh, let me feel thy touch--thy breath!  Yes, yes, thou livest! We arenot too late!  That dread door, methought it would never yield! andCalenus--oh! his voice was as the dying wind among tombs--we had towait--gods! it seemed hours ere food and wine restored to him somethingof strength.  But thou livest! thou livest yet! And I--I have savedthee!\'This affecting scene was soon interrupted by the event just described.\'The mountain! the earthquake!\' resounded from side to side.  Theofficers fled with the rest; they left Glaucus and Nydia to savethemselves as they might.As the sense of the dangers around them flashed on the Athenian, hisgenerous heart recurred to Olinthus.  He, too, was reprieved from thetiger by the hand of the gods; should he be left to a no less fataldeath in the neighboring cell?  Taking Nydia by the hand, Glaucushurried across the passages; he gained the den of the Christian!  Hefound Olinthus kneeling and in prayer.\'Arise! arise! my friend,\' he cried.  \'Save thyself, and fly! See!Nature is thy dread deliverer!\' He led forth the bewildered Christian,and pointed to a cloud which advanced darker and darker, disgorgingforth showers of ashes and pumice stones--and bade him hearken to thecries and trampling rush of the scattered crowd.\'This is the hand of God--God be praised!\' said Olinthus, devoutly.\'Fly! seek thy brethren!--Concert with them thy escape.  Farewell!\'Olinthus did not answer, neither did he mark the retreating form of hisfriend.  High thoughts and solemn absorbed his soul: and in theenthusiasm of his kindling heart, he exulted in the mercy of God ratherthan trembled at the evidence of His power.At length he roused himself, and hurried on, he scarce knew whither.The open doors of a dark, desolate cell suddenly appeared on his path;through the gloom within there flared and flickered a single lamp; andby its light he saw three grim and naked forms stretched on the earth indeath. His feet were suddenly arrested; for, amidst the terror of thatdrear recess--the spoliarium of the arena--he heard a low voice callingon the name of Christ!He could not resist lingering at that appeal: he entered the den, andhis feet were dabbled in the slow streams of blood that gushed from thecorpses over the sand.\'Who,\' said the Nazarene, \'calls upon the son of God?\'No answer came forth; and turning round, Olinthus beheld, by the lightof the lamp, an old grey-headed man sitting on the floor, and supportingin his lap the head of one of the dead.  The features of the dead manwere firmly and rigidly locked in the last sleep; but over the lip thereplayed a fierce smile--not the Christian\'s smile of hope, but the darksneer of hatred and defiance.  Yet on the face still lingered thebeautiful roundness of early youth.  The hair curled thick and glossyover the unwrinkled brow; and the down of manhood but slightly shadedthe marble of the hueless cheek.  And over this face bent one of suchunutterable sadness--of such yearning tenderness--of such fond and suchdeep despair!  The tears of the old man fell fast and hot, but he didnot feel them; and when his lips moved, and he mechanically uttered theprayer of his benign and hopeful faith, neither his heart nor his senseresponded to the words: it was but the involuntary emotion that brokefrom the lethargy of his mind.  His boy was dead, and had died forhim!--and the old man\'s heart was broken!\'Medon!\' said Olinthus, pityingly, \'arise, and fly!  God is forth uponthe wings of the elements!  The New Gomorrah is doomed!--Fly, ere thefires consume thee!\'\'He was ever so full of life!--he cannot be dead!  Come hither!--placeyour hand on his heart!--sure it beats yet?\'\'Brother, the soul has fled!  We will remember it in our prayers! Thoucanst not reanimate the dumb clay!  Come, come--hark! while I speak, yoncrashing walls!--hark! yon agonizing cries!  Not a moment is to belost!--Come!\'\'I hear nothing!\' said Medon, shaking his grey hair.  \'The poor boy, hislove murdered him!\'\'Come! come! forgive this friendly force.\'\'What!  Who could sever the father from the son?\' And Medon clasped thebody tightly in his embrace, and covered it with passionate kisses.\'Go!\' said he, lifting up his face for one moment.  \'Go!--we must bealone!\'\'Alas!\' said the compassionate Nazarene, \'Death hath severed yealready!\'The old man smiled very calmly.  \'No, no, no!\' muttered, his voicegrowing lower with each word--\'Death has been more kind!\'With that his head drooped on His son\'s breast--his arms relaxed theirgrasp.  Olinthus caught him by the hand--the pulse had ceased to beat!The last words of the father were the words of truth--Death had beenmore kind!Meanwhile Glaucus and Nydia were pacing swiftly up the perilous andfearful streets.  The Athenian had learned from his preserver that Ionewas yet in the house of Arbaces.  Thither he fled, to release--to saveher!  The few slaves whom the Egyptian had left at his mansion when hehad repaired in long procession to the amphitheatre, had been able tooffer no resistance to the armed band of Sallust; and when afterwardsthe volcano broke forth, they had huddled together, stunned andfrightened, in the inmost recesses of the house.  Even the tallEthiopian had forsaken his post at the door; and Glaucus (who left Nydiawithout--the poor Nydia, jealous once more, even in such an hour!)passed on through the vast hall without meeting one from whom to learnthe chamber of Ione.  Even as he passed, however, the darkness thatcovered the heavens increased so rapidly that it was with difficulty hecould guide his steps.  The flower-wreathed columns seemed to reel andtremble; and with every instant he heard the ashes fall cranchingly intothe roofless peristyle.  He ascended to the upper rooms--breathless hepaced along, shouting out aloud the name of Ione; and at length heheard, at the end of a gallery, a voice--her voice, in wondering reply!To rush forward--to shatter the door--to seize Ione in his arms--tohurry from the mansion--seemed to him the work of an instant!  Scarcehad he gained the spot where Nydia was, than he heard steps advancingtowards the house, and recognized the voice of Arbaces, who had returnedto seek his wealth and Ione ere he fled from the doomed Pompeii.  But sodense was already the reeking atmosphere, that the foes saw not eachother, though so near--save that, dimly in the gloom, Glaucus caught themoving outline of the snowy robes of the Egyptian.They hastened onward--those three.  Alas! whither?  They now saw not astep before them--the blackness became utter.  They were encompassedwith doubt and horror!--and the death he had escaped seemed to Glaucusonly to have changed its form and augmented its victims.Chapter VICALENUS AND BURBO.  DIOMED AND CLODIUS.  THE GIRL OF THE AMPHITHEATREAND JULIA.THE sudden catastrophe which had, as it were, riven the very bonds ofsociety, and left prisoner and jailer alike free, had soon rid Calenusof the guards to whose care the praetor had consigned him.  And when thedarkness and the crowd separated the priest from his attendants, hehastened with trembling steps towards the temple of his goddess.  As hecrept along, and ere the darkness was complete, he felt himself suddenlycaught by the robe, and a voice muttered in his ear:\'Hist!--Calenus!--an awful hour!\'\'Ay! by my father\'s head!  Who art thou?--thy face is dim, and thy voiceis strange.\'Not know thy Burbo?--fie!\'\'Gods!--how the darkness gathers!  Ho, ho!--by yon terrific mountain,what sudden blazes of lightning!\'--How they dart and quiver! Hades isloosed on earth!\'\'Tush!--thou believest not these things, Calenus!  Now is the time tomake our fortune!\'\'Ha!\'\'Listen! Thy temple is full of gold and precious mummeries!--let us loadourselves with them, and then hasten to the sea and embark! None willever ask an account of the doings of this day.\'\'Burbo, thou art right!  Hush, and follow me into the temple.  Who caresnow--who sees now--whether thou art a priest or not?  Follow, and wewill share.\'In the precincts of the temple were many priests gathered around thealtars, praying, weeping, grovelling in the dust.  Impostors in safety,they were not the less superstitious in danger!  Calenus passed them,and entered the chamber yet to be seen in the south side of the court.Burbo followed him--the priest struck a light.  Wine and viands strewedthe table; the remains of a sacrificial feast.\'A man who has hungered forty-eight hours,\' muttered Calenus, \'has anappetite even in such a time.\' He seized on the food, and devoured itgreedily.  Nothing could perhaps, be more unnaturally horrid than theselfish baseness of these villains; for there is nothing more loathsomethan the valor of avarice.  Plunder and sacrilege while the pillars ofthe world tottered to and fro!  What an increase to the terrors ofnature can be made by the vices of man!\'Wilt thou never have done?\' said Burbo, impatiently; \'thy face purplesand thine eyes start already.\'\'It is not every day one has such a right to be hungry.  Oh, Jupiter!what sound is that?--the hissing of fiery water!  What! does the cloudgive rain as well as flame!  Ha!--what! shrieks?  And, Burbo, how silentall is now! Look forth!\'Amidst the other horrors, the mighty mountain now cast up columns ofboiling water.  Blent and kneaded with the half-burning ashes, thestreams fell like seething mud over the streets in frequent intervals.And full, where the priests of Isis had now cowered around the altars,on which they had vainly sought to kindle fires and pour incense, one ofthe fiercest of those deadly torrents, mingled with immense fragments ofscoria, had poured its rage. Over the bended forms of the priests itdashed: that cry had been of death--that silence had been of eternity!The ashes--the pitchy streams--sprinkled the altars, covered thepavement, and half concealed the quivering corpses of the priests!\'They are dead,\' said Burbo, terrified for the first time, and hurryingback into the cell.  \'I thought not the danger was so near and fatal.\'The two wretches stood staring at each other--you might have heard theirhearts beat!  Calenus, the less bold by nature, but the more griping,recovered first.\'We must to our task, and away!\' he said, in a low whisper, frightenedat his own voice.  He stepped to the threshold, paused, crossed over theheated floor and his dead brethren to the sacred chapel, and called toBurbo to follow.  But the gladiator quaked, and drew back.\'So much the better,\' thought Calenus; \'the more will be my booty.\'Hastily he loaded himself with the more portable treasures of thetemple; and thinking no more of his comrade, hurried from the sacredplace.  A sudden flash of lightning from the mount showed to Burbo, whostood motionless at the threshold, the flying and laden form of thepriest.  He took heart; he stepped forth to join him, when a tremendousshower of ashes fell right before his feet.  The gladiator shrank backonce more.  Darkness closed him in.  But the shower continuedfast--fast; its heaps rose high and suffocatingly--deathly vaporssteamed from them.  The wretch gasped for breath--he sought in despairagain to fly--the ashes had blocked up the threshold--he shrieked as hisfeet shrank from the boiling fluid. How could he escape? he could notclimb to the open space; nay, were he able, he could not brave itshorrors.  It were best to remain in the cells, protected, at least, fromthe fatal air. He sat down and clenched his teeth.  By degrees, theatmosphere from without--stifling and venomous--crept into the chamber.He could endure it no longer.  His eyes, glaring round, rested on asacrificial axe, which some priest had left in the chamber: he seizedit. With the desperate strength of his gigantic arm, he attempted to hewhis way through the walls.Meanwhile, the streets were already thinned; the crowd had hastened todisperse itself under shelter; the ashes began to fill up the lowerparts of the town; but, here and there, you heard the steps of fugitivescranching them warily, or saw their pale and haggard faces by the blueglare of the lightning, or the more unsteady glare of torches, by whichthey endeavored to steer their steps. But ever and anon, the boilingwater, or the straggling ashes, mysterious and gusty winds, rising anddying in a breath, extinguished these wandering lights, and with themthe last living hope of those who bore them.In the street that leads to the gate of Herculaneum, Clodius now benthis perplexed and doubtful way.  \'If I can gain the open country,\'thought he, \'doubtless there will be various vehicles beyond the gate,and Herculaneum is not far distant.  Thank Mercury!  I have little tolose, and that little is about me!\'\'Holla!--help there--help!\' cried a querulous and frightened voice.  \'Ihave fallen down--my torch has gone out--my slaves have deserted me.  Iam Diomed--the rich Diomed--ten thousand sesterces to him who helps me!\'At the same moment, Clodius felt himself caught by the feet. \'Illfortune to thee--let me go, fool,\' said the gambler.\'Oh, help me up!--give me thy hand!\'\'There--rise!\'\'Is this Clodius?  I know the voice!  Whither fliest thou?\'\'Towards Herculaneum.\'\'Blessed be the gods! our way is the same, then, as far as the gate.Why not take refuge in my villa?  Thou knowest the long range ofsubterranean cellars beneath the basement--that shelter, what shower canpenetrate?\'\'You speak well,\' said Clodius musingly.  \'And by storing the cellarwith food, we can remain there even some days, should these wondrousstorms endure so long.\'\'Oh, blessed be he who invented gates to a city!\' cried Diomed.\'See!--they have placed a light within yon arch: by that let us guideour steps.\'The air was now still for a few minutes: the lamp from the gate streamedout far and clear: the fugitives hurried on--they gained the gate--theypassed by the Roman sentry; the lightning flashed over his livid faceand polished helmet, but his stern features were composed even in theirawe!  He remained erect and motionless at his post.  That hour itselfhad not animated the machine of the ruthless majesty of Rome into thereasoning and self-acting man.  There he stood, amidst the crashingelements: he had not received the permission to desert his station andescape.Diomed and his companion hurried on, when suddenly a female form rushedathwart their way.  It was the girl whose ominous voice had been raisedso often and so gladly in anticipation of \'the merry show\'.\'Oh, Diomed!\' she cried, \'shelter! shelter!  See\'--pointing to an infantclasped to her breast--\'see this little one!--it is mine!--the child ofshame!  I have never owned it till this hour.  But now I remember I am amother!  I have plucked it from the cradle of its nurse: she had fled!Who could think of the babe in such an hour, but she who bore it?  Saveit! save it!\'\'Curses on thy shrill voice!  Away, harlot!\' muttered Clodius betweenhis ground teeth.\'Nay, girl,\' said the more humane Diomed; \'follow if thou wilt. Thisway--this way--to the vaults!\'They hurried on--they arrived at the house of Diomed--they laughed aloudas they crossed the threshold, for they deemed the danger over.Diomed ordered his slaves to carry down into the subterranean gallery,before described, a profusion of food and oil for lights; and thereJulia, Clodius, the mother and her babe, the greater part of the slaves,and some frightened visitors and clients of the neighborhood, soughttheir shelter.Chapter VIITHE PROGRESS OF THE DESTRUCTION.THE cloud, which had scattered so deep a murkiness over the day, had nowsettled into a solid and impenetrable mass.  It resembled less even thethickest gloom of a night in the open air than the close and blinddarkness of some narrow room.  But in proportion as the blacknessgathered, did the lightnings around Vesuvius increase in their vivid andscorching glare.  Nor was their horrible beauty confined to the usualhues of fire; no rainbow ever rivalled their varying and prodigal dyes.Now brightly blue as the most azure depth of a southern sky--now of alivid and snakelike green, darting restlessly to and fro as the folds ofan enormous serpent--now of a lurid and intolerable crimson, gushingforth through the columns of smoke, far and wide, and lighting up thewhole city from arch to arch--then suddenly dying into a sicklypaleness, like the ghost of their own life!In the pauses of the showers, you heard the rumbling of the earthbeneath, and the groaning waves of the tortured sea; or, lower still,and audible but to the watch of intensest fear, the grinding and hissingmurmur of the escaping gases through the chasms of the distant mountain.Sometimes the cloud appeared to break from its solid mass, and, by thelightning, to assume quaint and vast mimicries of human or of monstershapes, striding across the gloom, hurtling one upon the other, andvanishing swiftly into the turbulent abyss of shade; so that, to theeyes and fancies of the affrighted wanderers, the unsubstantial vaporswere as the bodily forms of gigantic foes--the agents of terror and ofdeath.The ashes in many places were already knee-deep; and the boiling showerswhich came from the steaming breath of the volcano forced their way intothe houses, bearing with them a strong and suffocating vapor.  In someplaces, immense fragments of rock, hurled upon the house roofs, boredown along the streets masses of confused ruin, which yet more and more,with every hour, obstructed the way; and, as the day advanced, themotion of the earth was more sensibly felt--the footing seemed to slideand creep--nor could chariot or litter be kept steady, even on the mostlevel ground.Sometimes the huger stones striking against each other as they fell,broke into countless fragments, emitting sparks of fire, which caughtwhatever was combustible within their reach; and along the plains beyondthe city the darkness was now terribly relieved; for several houses, andeven vineyards, had been set on flames; and at various intervals thefires rose suddenly and fiercely against the solid gloom.  To add tothis partial relief of the darkness, the citizens had, here and there,in the more public places, such as the porticoes of temples and theentrances to the forum, endeavored to place rows of torches; but theserarely continued long; the showers and the winds extinguished them, andthe sudden darkness into which their sudden birth was converted hadsomething in it doubly terrible and doubly impressing on the impotenceof human hopes, the lesson of despair.Frequently, by the momentary light of these torches, parties offugitives encountered each other, some hurrying towards the sea, othersflying from the sea back to the land; for the ocean had retreatedrapidly from the shore--an utter darkness lay over it, and upon itsgroaning and tossing waves the storm of cinders and rock fell withoutthe protection which the streets and roofs afforded to the land.Wild--haggard--ghastly with supernatural fears, these groups encounteredeach other, but without the leisure to speak, to consult, to advise; forthe showers fell now frequently, though not continuously, extinguishingthe lights, which showed to each band the deathlike faces of the other,and hurrying all to seek refuge beneath the nearest shelter.  The wholeelements of civilization were broken up.  Ever and anon, by theflickering lights, you saw the thief hastening by the most solemnauthorities of the law, laden with, and fearfully chuckling over, theproduce of his sudden gains.  If, in the darkness, wife was separatedfrom husband, or parent from child, vain was the hope of reunion.  Eachhurried blindly and confusedly on.  Nothing in all the various andcomplicated machinery of social life was left save the primal law ofself-preservation!Through this awful scene did the Athenian wade his way, accompanied byIone and the blind girl.  Suddenly, a rush of hundreds, in their path tothe sea, swept by them.  Nydia was torn from the side of Glaucus, who,with Ione, was borne rapidly onward; and when the crowd (whose formsthey saw not, so thick was the gloom) were gone, Nydia was stillseparated from their side. Glaucus shouted her name.  No answer came.They retraced their steps--in vain: they could not discover her--it wasevident she had been swept along some opposite direction by the humancurrent.  Their friend, their preserver, was lost!  And hitherto Nydiahad been their guide.  Her blindness rendered the scene familiar to heralone.  Accustomed, through a perpetual night, to thread the windings ofthe city, she had led them unerringly towards the sea-shore, by whichthey had resolved to hazard an escape.  Now, which way could they wend?all was rayless to them--a maze without a clue.  Wearied, despondent,bewildered, they, however, passed along, the ashes falling upon theirheads, the fragmentary stones dashing up in sparkles before their feet.\'Alas! alas!\' murmured Ione, \'I can go no farther; my steps sink amongthe scorching cinders.  Fly, dearest!--beloved, fly! and leave me to myfate!\'\'Hush, my betrothed! my bride!  Death with thee is sweeter than lifewithout thee!  Yet, whither--oh! whither, can we direct ourselvesthrough the gloom? Already it seems that we have made but a circle, andare in the very spot which we quitted an hour ago.\'\'O gods! yon rock--see, it hath riven the roof before us!  It is deathto move through the streets!\'\'Blessed lightning!  See, Ione--see! the portico of the Temple ofFortune is before us.  Let us creep beneath it; it will protect us fromthe showers.\'He caught his beloved in his arms, and with difficulty and labor gainedthe temple.  He bore her to the remoter and more sheltered part of theportico, and leaned over her, that he might shield her, with his ownform, from the lightning and the showers!  The beauty and theunselfishness of love could hallow even that dismal time!\'Who is there?\' said the trembling and hollow voice of one who hadpreceded them in their place of refuge.  \'Yet, what matters?--the crushof the ruined world forbids to us friends or foes.\'Ione turned at the sound of the voice, and, with a faint shriek, coweredagain beneath the arms of Glaucus: and he, looking in the direction ofthe voice, beheld the cause of her alarm.  Through the darkness glaredforth two burning eyes--the lightning flashed and lingered athwart thetemple--and Glaucus, with a shudder, perceived the lion to which he hadbeen doomed couched beneath the pillars--and, close beside it, unwittingof the vicinity, lay the giant form of him who had accosted them--thewounded gladiator, Niger.That lightning had revealed to each other the form of beast and man; yetthe instinct of both was quelled.  Nay, the lion crept nearer and nearerto the gladiator, as for companionship; and the gladiator did not recedeor tremble.  The revolution of Nature had dissolved her lighter terrorsas well as her wonted ties.While they were thus terribly protected, a group of men and women,bearing torches, passed by the temple.  They were of the congregation ofthe Nazarenes; and a sublime and unearthly emotion had not, indeed,quelled their awe, but it had robbed awe of fear.  They had longbelieved, according to the error of the early Christians, that the LastDay was at hand; they imagined now that the Day had come.\'Woe! woe!\' cried, in a shrill and piercing voice, the elder at theirhead. \'Behold! the Lord descendeth to judgment!  He maketh fire comedown from heaven in the sight of men!  Woe! woe! ye strong and mighty!Woe to ye of the fasces and the purple!  Woe to the idolater and theworshipper of the beast!  Woe to ye who pour forth the blood of saints,and gloat over the death-pangs of the sons of God!  Woe to the harlot ofthe sea!--woe! woe!\'And with a loud and deep chorus, the troop chanted forth along the wildhorrors of the air, \'Woe to the harlot of the sea!--woe! woe!\'The Nazarenes paced slowly on, their torches still flickering in thestorm, their voices still raised in menace and solemn warning, till,lost amid the windings in the streets, the darkness of the atmosphereand the silence of death again fell over the scene.There was one of the frequent pauses in the showers, and Glaucusencouraged Ione once more to proceed.  Just as they stood, hesitating,on the last step of the portico, an old man, with a bag in his righthand and leaning upon a youth, tottered by.  The youth bore a torch.Glaucus recognized the two as father and son--miser and prodigal.\'Father,\' said the youth, \'if you cannot move more swiftly, I must leaveyou, or we both perish!\'\'Fly, boy, then, and leave thy sire!\'\'But I cannot fly to starve; give me thy bag of gold!\' And the youthsnatched at it.\'Wretch! wouldst thou rob thy father?\'\'Ay! who can tell the tale in this hour?  Miser, perish!\'The boy struck the old man to the ground, plucked the bag from hisrelaxing hand, and fled onward with a shrill yell.\'Ye gods!\' cried Glaucus: \'are ye blind, then, even in the dark? Suchcrimes may well confound the guiltless with the guilty in one commonruin.  Ione, on!--on!\'Chapter VIIIARBACES ENCOUNTERS GLAUCUS AND IONE.ADVANCING, as men grope for escape in a dungeon, Ione and her lovercontinued their uncertain way.  At the moments when the volcaniclightnings lingered over the streets, they were enabled, by that awfullight, to steer and guide their progress: yet, little did the view itpresented to them cheer or encourage their path.  In parts, where theashes lay dry and uncommixed with the boiling torrents, cast upward fromthe mountain at capricious intervals, the surface of the earth presenteda leprous and ghastly white.  In other places, cinder and rock laymatted in heaps, from beneath which emerged the half-hid limbs of somecrushed and mangled fugitive.  The groans of the dying were broken bywild shrieks of women\'s terror--now near, now distant--which, when heardin the utter darkness, were rendered doubly appalling by the crushingsense of helplessness and the uncertainty of the perils around; andclear and distinct through all were the mighty and various noises fromthe Fatal Mountain; its rushing winds; its whirling torrents; and, fromtime to time, the burst and roar of some more fiery and fierceexplosion.  And ever as the winds swept howling along the street, theybore sharp streams of burning dust, and such sickening and poisonousvapors, as took away, for the instant, breath and consciousness,followed by a rapid revulsion of the arrested blood, and a tinglingsensation of agony trembling through every nerve and fibre of the frame.\'Oh, Glaucus! my beloved! my own!--take me to thy arms!  One embrace!let me feel thy arms around me--and in that embrace let me die--I can nomore!\'\'For my sake, for my life--courage, yet, sweet Ione--my life is linkedwith thine: and see--torches--this way!  Lo! how they brave the Wind!Ha! they live through the storm--doubtless, fugitives to the sea! wewill join them.\'As if to aid and reanimate the lovers, the winds and showers came to asudden pause; the atmosphere was profoundly still--the mountain seemedat rest, gathering, perhaps, fresh fury for its next burst; thetorch-bearers moved quickly on.  \'We are nearing the sea,\' said, in acalm voice, the person at their head.  \'Liberty and wealth to each slavewho survives this day!  Courage!  I tell you that the gods themselveshave assured me of deliverance.  On!\'Redly and steadily the torches flashed full on the eyes of Glaucus andIone, who lay trembling and exhausted on his bosom.  Several slaves werebearing, by the light, panniers and coffers, heavily laden; in front ofthem--a drawn sword in his hand--towered the lofty form of Arbaces.\'By my fathers!\' cried the Egyptian, \'Fate smiles upon me even throughthese horrors, and, amidst the dreadest aspects of woe and death, bodesme happiness and love.  Away, Greek!  I claim my ward, Ione!\'\'Traitor and murderer!\' cried Glaucus, glaring upon his foe, \'Nemesishath guided thee to my revenge!--a just sacrifice to the shades ofHades, that now seem loosed on earth.  Approach--touch but the hand ofIone, and thy weapon shall be as a reed--I will tear thee limb fromlimb!\'Suddenly, as he spoke, the place became lighted with an intense andlurid glow.  Bright and gigantic through the darkness, which closedaround it like the walls of hell, the mountain shone--a pile of fire!Its summit seemed riven in two; or rather, above its surface thereseemed to rise two monster shapes, each confronting each, as Demonscontending for a world.  These were of one deep blood-red hue of fire,which lighted up the whole atmosphere far and wide; but, below, thenether part of the mountain was still dark and shrouded, save in threeplaces, adown which flowed, serpentine and irregular, rivers of themolten lava.  Darkly red through the profound gloom of their banks, theyflowed slowly on, as towards the devoted city. Over the broadest thereseemed to spring a cragged and stupendous arch, from which, as from thejaws of hell, gushed the sources of the sudden Phlegethon.  And throughthe stilled air was heard the rattling of the fragments of rock,hurtling one upon another as they were borne down the fierycataracts--darkening, for one instant, the spot where they fell, andsuffused the next, in the burnished hues of the flood along which theyfloated!The slaves shrieked aloud, and, cowering, hid their faces.  The Egyptianhimself stood transfixed to the spot, the glow lighting up hiscommanding features and jewelled robes.  High behind him rose a tallcolumn that supported the bronze statue of Augustus; and the imperialimage seemed changed to a shape of fire!With his left hand circled round the form of Ione--with his right armraised in menace, and grasping the stilus which was to have been hisweapon in the arena, and which he still fortunately bore about him, withhis brow knit, his lips apart, the wrath and menace of human passionsarrested as by a charm, upon his features, Glaucus fronted the Egyptian!Arbaces turned his eyes from the mountain--they rested on the form ofGlaucus!  He paused a moment: \'Why,\' he muttered, \'should I hesitate?Did not the stars foretell the only crisis of imminent peril to which Iwas subjected?--Is not that peril past?\'\'The soul,\' cried he aloud, \'can brave the wreck of worlds and the wrathof imaginary gods!  By that soul will I conquer to the last! Advance,slaves!--Athenian, resist me, and thy blood be on thine own head!  Thus,then, I regain Ione!\'He advanced one step--it was his last on earth!  The ground shookbeneath him with a convulsion that cast all around upon its surface.  Asimultaneous crash resounded through the city, as down toppled many aroof and pillar!--the lightning, as if caught by the metal, lingered aninstant on the Imperial Statue--then shivered bronze and column! Downfell the ruin, echoing along the street, and riving the solid pavementwhere it crashed!--The prophecy of the stars was fulfilled!The sound--the shock, stunned the Athenian for several moments. When herecovered, the light still illuminated the scene--the earth still slidand trembled beneath!  Ione lay senseless on the ground; but he saw hernot yet--his eyes were fixed upon a ghastly face that seemed to emerge,without limbs or trunk, from the huge fragments of the shatteredcolumn--a face of unutterable pain, agony, and despair!  The eyes shutand opened rapidly, as if sense were not yet fled; the lips quivered andgrinned--then sudden stillness and darkness fell over the features, yetretaining that aspect of horror never to be forgotten!So perished the wise Magician--the great Arbaces--the Hermes of theBurning Belt--the last of the royalty of Egypt!Chapter IXTHE DESPAIR OF THE LOVERS.  THE CONDITION OF THE MULTITUDE.GLAUCUS turned in gratitude but in awe, caught Ione once more in hisarms, and fled along the street, that was yet intensely luminous.  Butsuddenly a duller shade fell over the air.  Instinctively he turned tothe mountain, and beheld! one of the two gigantic crests, into which thesummit had been divided, rocked and wavered to and fro; and then, with asound, the mightiness of which no language can describe, it fell fromits burning base, and rushed, an avalanche of fire, down the sides ofthe mountain!  At the same instant gushed forth a volume of blackestsmoke--rolling on, over air, sea, and earth.Another--and another--and another shower of ashes, far more profuse thanbefore, scattered fresh desolation along the streets. Darkness once morewrapped them as a veil; and Glaucus, his bold heart at last quelled anddespairing, sank beneath the cover of an arch, and, clasping Ione to hisheart--a bride on that couch of ruin--resigned himself to die.Meanwhile Nydia, when separated by the throng from Glaucus and Ione, hadin vain endeavored to regain them.  In vain she raised that plaintivecry so peculiar to the blind; it was lost amidst a thousand shrieks ofmore selfish terror.  Again and again she returned to the spot wherethey had been divided--to find her companions gone, to seize everyfugitive--to inquire of Glaucus--to be dashed aside in the impatience ofdistraction.  Who in that hour spared one thought to his neighbor?Perhaps in scenes of universal horror, nothing is more horrid than theunnatural selfishness they engender. At length it occurred to Nydia,that as it had been resolved to seek the sea-shore for escape, her mostprobable chance of rejoining her companions would be to persevere inthat direction.  Guiding her steps, then, by the staff which she alwayscarried, she continued, with incredible dexterity, to avoid the massesof ruin that encumbered the path--to thread the streets--and unerringly(so blessed now was that accustomed darkness, so afflicting in ordinarylife!) to take the nearest direction to the sea-side.Poor girl!--her courage was beautiful to behold!--and Fate seemed tofavor one so helpless!  The boiling torrents touched her not, save bythe general rain which accompanied them; the huge fragments of scoriashivered the pavement before and beside her, but spared that frail form:and when the lesser ashes fell over her, she shook them away with aslight tremor, and dauntlessly resumed her course.Weak, exposed, yet fearless, supported but by one wish, she was a veryemblem of Psyche in her wanderings; of Hope, walking through the Valleyof the Shadow; of the Soul itself--lone but undaunted, amidst thedangers and the snares of life!Her path was, however, constantly impeded by the crowds that now gropedamidst the gloom, now fled in the temporary glare of the lightningsacross the scene; and, at length, a group of torch-bearers rushing fullagainst her, she was thrown down with some violence.\'What!\' said the voice of one of the party, \'is this the brave blindgirl! By Bacchus, she must not be left here to die!  Up, my Thessalian!So--so. Are you hurt?  That\'s well!  Come along with us! we are for theshore!\'\'O Sallust! it is thy voice!  The gods be thanked!  Glaucus! Glaucus!Glaucus! have ye seen him?\'\'Not I.  He is doubtless out of the city by this time.  The gods whosaved him from the lion will save him from the burning mountain.\'As the kindly epicure thus encouraged Nydia, he drew her along with himtowards the sea, heeding not her passionate entreaties that he wouldlinger yet awhile to search for Glaucus; and still, in the accent ofdespair, she continued to shriek out that beloved name, which, amidstall the roar of the convulsed elements, kept alive a music at her heart.The sudden illumination, the bursts of the floods of lava, and theearthquake, which we have already described, chanced when Sallust andhis party had just gained the direct path leading from the city to theport; and here they were arrested by an immense crowd, more than halfthe population of the city.  They spread along the field without thewalls, thousands upon thousands, uncertain whither to fly.  The sea hadretired far from the shore; and they who had fled to it had been soterrified by the agitation and preternatural shrinking of the element,the gasping forms of the uncouth sea things which the waves had leftupon the sand, and by the sound of the huge stones cast from themountain into the deep, that they had returned again to the land, aspresenting the less frightful aspect of the two.  Thus the two streamsof human beings, the one seaward, the other from the sea, had mettogether, feeling a sad comfort in numbers; arrested in despair anddoubt.\'The world is to be destroyed by fire,\' said an old man in long looserobes, a philosopher of the Stoic school: \'Stoic and Epicurean wisdomhave alike agreed in this prediction: and the hour is come!\'\'Yea; the hour is come!\' cried a loud voice, solemn, but not fearful.Those around turned in dismay.  The voice came from above them. It wasthe voice of Olinthus, who, surrounded by his Christian friends, stoodupon an abrupt eminence on which the old Greek colonists had raised atemple to Apollo, now timeworn and half in ruin.As he spoke there came that sudden illumination which had heralded thedeath of Arbaces, and glowing over that mighty multitude, awed,crouching, breathless--never on earth had the faces of men seemed sohaggard!--never had meeting of mortal beings been so stamped with thehorror and sublimity of dread!--never till the last trumpet sounds,shall such meeting be seen again!  And above those the form of Olinthus,with outstretched arm and prophet brow, girt with the living fires.  Andthe crowd knew the face of him they had doomed to the fangs of thebeast--then their victim--now their warner! and through the stillnessagain came his ominous voice:\'The hour is come!\'The Christians repeated the cry.  It was caught up--it was echoed fromside to side--woman and man, childhood and old age, repeated, not aloud,but in a smothered and dreary murmur:\'THE HOUR IS COME!\'At that moment, a wild yell burst through the air--and, thinking only ofescape, whither it knew not, the terrible tiger of the desert leapedamongst the throng, and hurried through its parted streams.  And so camethe earthquake--and so darkness once more fell over the earth!And now new fugitives arrived.  Grasping the treasures no longerdestined for their lord, the slaves of Arbaces joined the throng. Oneonly of all their torches yet flickered on.  It was borne by Sosia; andits light falling on the face of Nydia, he recognized the Thessalian.\'What avails thy liberty now, blind girl?\' said the slave.\'Who art thou? canst thou tell me of Glaucus?\'\'Ay; I saw him but a few minutes since.\'\'Blessed be thy head! where?\'\'Crouched beneath the arch of the forum--dead or dying!--gone to rejoinArbaces, who is no more!\'Nydia uttered not a word, she slid from the side of Sallust; silentlyshe glided through those behind her, and retraced her steps to the city.She gained the forum--the arch; she stooped down--she felt around--shecalled on the name of Glaucus.A weak voice answered--\'Who calls on me?  Is it the voice of the Shades?Lo! I am prepared!\'\'Arise! follow me!  Take my hand! Glaucus, thou shalt be saved!\'In wonder and sudden hope, Glaucus arose--\'Nydia still?  Ah! thou, then,art safe!\'The tender joy of his voice pierced the heart of the poor Thessalian,and she blessed him for his thought of her.Half leading, half carrying Ione, Glaucus followed his guide.  Withadmirable discretion, she avoided the path which led to the crowd shehad just quitted, and, by another route, sought the shore.After many pauses and incredible perseverance, they gained the sea, andjoined a group, who, bolder than the rest, resolved to hazard any perilrather than continue in such a scene.  In darkness they put forth tosea; but, as they cleared the land and caught new aspects of themountain, its channels of molten fire threw a partial redness over thewaves.Utterly exhausted and worn out, Ione slept on the breast of Glaucus, andNydia lay at his feet.  Meanwhile the showers of dust and ashes, stillborne aloft, fell into the wave, and scattered their snows over thedeck.  Far and wide, borne by the winds, those showers descended uponthe remotest climes, startling even the swarthy African; and whirledalong the antique soil of Syria and of Egypt (Dion Cassius).Chapter XTHE NEXT MORNING.  THE FATE OF NYDIA.AND meekly, softly, beautifully, dawned at last the light over thetrembling deep!--the winds were sinking into rest--the foam died fromthe glowing azure of that delicious sea.  Around the east, thin mistscaught gradually the rosy hues that heralded the morning; Light wasabout to resume her reign.  Yet, still, dark and massive in thedistance, lay the broken fragments of the destroying cloud, from whichred streaks, burning dimlier and more dim, betrayed the yet rollingfires of the mountain of the \'Scorched Fields\'.  The white walls andgleaming columns that had adorned the lovely coasts were no more.Sullen and dull were the shores so lately crested by the cities ofHerculaneum and Pompeii.  The darlings of the deep were snatched fromher embrace!  Century after century shall the mighty Mother stretchforth her azure arms, and know them not--moaning round the sepulchres ofthe Lost!There was no shout from the mariners at the dawning light--it had cometoo gradually, and they were too wearied for such sudden bursts ofjoy--but there was a low, deep murmur of thankfulness amidst thosewatchers of the long night.  They looked at each other and smiled--theytook heart--they felt once more that there was a world around, and a Godabove them!  And in the feeling that the worst was passed, theoverwearied ones turned round, and fell placidly to sleep. In thegrowing light of the skies there came the silence which night hadwanted: and the bark drifted calmly onward to its port.  A few othervessels, bearing similar fugitives, might be seen in the expanse,apparently motionless, yet gliding also on.  There was a sense ofsecurity, of companionship, and of hope, in the sight of their slendermasts and white sails.  What beloved friends, lost and missed in thegloom, might they not bear to safety and to shelter!In the silence of the general sleep, Nydia rose gently.  She bent overthe face of Glaucus--she inhaled the deep breath of his heavyslumber--timidly and sadly she kissed his brow--his lips; she felt forhis hand--it was locked in that of Ione; she sighed deeply, and her facedarkened. Again she kissed his brow, and with her hair wiped from it thedamps of night.  \'May the gods bless you, Athenian!\' she murmured: \'mayyou be happy with your beloved one!--may you sometimes remember Nydia!Alas! she is of no further use on earth!\'With these words she turned away.  Slowly she crept along by the fori,or platforms, to the farther side of the vessel, and, pausing, bent lowover the deep; the cool spray dashed upward on her feverish brow.  \'Itis the kiss of death,\' she said \'it is welcome.\' The balmy air playedthrough her waving tresses--she put them from her face, and raised thoseeyes--so tender, though so lightless--to the sky, whose soft face shehad never seen!\'No, no!\' she said, half aloud, and in a musing and thoughtful tone, \'Icannot endure it; this jealous, exacting love--it shatters my whole soulin madness!  I might harm him again--wretch that I was!  I have savedhim--twice saved him--happy, happy thought: why not die happy?--it isthe last glad thought I can ever know.  Oh! sacred Sea!  I hear thyvoice invitingly--it hath a freshening and joyous call. They say that inthy embrace is dishonour--that thy victims cross not the fatal Styx--beit so!--I would not meet him in the Shades, for I should meet him stillwith her!  Rest--rest--rest! there is no other Elysium for a heart likemine!\'A sailor, half dozing on the deck, heard a slight splash on the waters.Drowsily he looked up, and behind, as the vessel merrily bounded on, hefancied he saw something white above the waves; but it vanished in aninstant.  He turned round again, and dreamed of his home and children.When the lovers awoke, their first thought was of each other--their nextof Nydia!  She was not to be found--none had seen her since the night.Every crevice of the vessel was searched--there was no trace of her.Mysterious from first to last, the blind Thessalian had vanished forever from the living world!  They guessed her fate in silence: andGlaucus and Ione, while they drew nearer to each other (feeling eachother the world itself), forgot their deliverance, and wept as for adeparted sister.Chapter The LastWHEREIN ALL THINGS CEASE LETTER FROM GLAUCUS TO SALLUST, TEN YEARS AFTERTHE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII.\'Athens.GLAUCUS to his beloved Sallust--greeting and health!--You request me tovisit you at Rome--no, Sallust, come rather to me at Athens!  I haveforsworn the Imperial City, its mighty tumult and hollow joys.  In myown land henceforth I dwell for ever.  The ghost of our departedgreatness is dearer to me than the gaudy life of your loud prosperity.There is a charm to me which no other spot can supply, in the porticoeshallowed still by holy and venerable shades.  In the olive-groves ofIlyssus I still hear the voice of poetry--on the heights of Phyle, theclouds of twilight seem yet the shrouds of departed freedom--theheralds--the heralds--of the morrow that shall come!  You smile at myenthusiasm, Sallust!--better be hopeful in chains than resigned to theirglitter.  You tell me you are sure that I cannot enjoy life in thesemelancholy haunts of a fallen majesty.  You dwell with rapture on theRoman splendors, and the luxuries of the imperial court. MySallust--""non sum qualis eram""--I am not what I was!  The events of mylife have sobered the bounding blood of my youth.  My health has neverquite recovered its wonted elasticity ere it felt the pangs of disease,and languished in the damps of a criminal\'s dungeon.  My mind has nevershaken off the dark shadow of the Last Day of Pompeii--the horror andthe desolation of that awful ruin!--Our beloved, our remembered Nydia! Ihave reared a tomb to her shade, and I see it every day from the windowof my study. It keeps alive in me a tender recollection--a notunpleasing sadness--which are but a fitting homage to her fidelity, andthe mysteriousness of her early death.  Ione gathers the flowers, but myown hand wreathes them daily around the tomb.  She was worthy of a tombin Athens!\'You speak of the growing sect of the Christians in Rome.  Sallust, toyou I may confide my secret; I have pondered much over that faith--Ihave adopted it.  After the destruction of Pompeii, I met once more withOlinthus--saved, alas! only for a day, and falling afterwards a martyrto the indomitable energy of his zeal.  In my preservation from the lionand the earthquake he taught me to behold the hand of the unknown God!I listened--believed--adored!  My own, my more than ever beloved Ione,has also embraced the creed!--a creed, Sallust, which, shedding lightover this world, gathers its concentrated glory, like a sunset, over thenext!  We know that we are united in the soul, as in the flesh, for everand for ever! Ages may roll on, our very dust be dissolved, the earthshrivelled like a scroll; but round and round the circle of eternityrolls the wheel of life--imperishable--unceasing!  And as the earth fromthe sun, so immortality drinks happiness from virtue, which is the smileupon the face of God!  Visit me, then, Sallust; bring with you thelearned scrolls of Epicurus, Pythagoras, Diogenes; arm yourself fordefeat; and let us, amidst the groves of Academus, dispute, under asurer guide than any granted to our fathers, on the mighty problem ofthe true ends of life and the nature of the soul.\'Ione--at that name my heart yet beats!--Ione is by my side as I write:I lift my eyes, and meet her smile.  The sunlight quivers over Hymettus:and along my garden I hear the hum of the summer bees.  Am I happy, askyou? Oh, what can Rome give me equal to what I possess at Athens?  Here,everything awakens the soul and inspires the affections--the trees, thewaters, the hills, the skies, are those of Athens!--fair, thoughmourning-mother of the Poetry and the Wisdom of the World.  In my hall Isee the marble faces of my ancestors.  In the Ceramicus, I survey theirtombs! In the streets, I behold the hand of Phidias and the soul ofPericles. Harmodius, Aristogiton--they are everywhere--but in ourhearts!--in mine, at least, they shall not perish!  If anything can makeme forget that I am an Athenian and not free, it is partly thesoothing--the love--watchful, vivid, sleepless--of Ione--a love that hastaken a new sentiment in our new creed--a love which none of our poets,beautiful though they be, had shadowed forth in description; for mingledwith religion, it partakes of religion; it is blended with pure andunworldly thoughts; it is that which we may hope to carry througheternity, and keep, therefore, white and unsullied, that we may notblush to confess it to our God!  This is the true type of the dark fableof our Grecian Eros and Psyche--it is, in truth, the soul asleep in thearms of love.  And if this, our love, support me partly against thefever of the desire for freedom, my religion supports me more; forwhenever I would grasp the sword and sound the shell, and rush to a newMarathon (but Marathon without victory), I feel my despair at thechilling thought of my country\'s impotence--the crushing weight of theRoman yoke, comforted, at least, by the thought that earth is but thebeginning of life--that the glory of a few years matters little in thevast space of eternity--that there is no perfect freedom till the chainsof clay fall from the soul, and all space, all time, become its heritageand domain.  Yet, Sallust, some mixture of the soft Greek blood stillmingles with my faith. I can share not the zeal of those who see crimeand eternal wrath in men who cannot believe as they.  I shudder not atthe creed of others.  I dare not curse them--I pray the Great Father toconvert.  This lukewarmness exposes me to some suspicion amongst theChristians: but I forgive it; and, not offending openly the prejudicesof the crowd, I am thus enabled to protect my brethren from the dangerof the law, and the consequences of their own zeal.  If moderation seemto me the natural creature of benevolence, it gives, also, the greatestscope to beneficence.\'Such, then, O Sallust! is my life--such my opinions.  In this manner Igreet existence and await death.  And thou, glad-hearted and kindlypupil of Epicurus, thou...  But come hither, and see what enjoyments,what hopes are ours--and not the splendor of imperial banquets, nor theshouts of the crowded circus, nor the noisy forum, nor the glitteringtheatre, nor the luxuriant gardens, nor the voluptuous baths ofRome--shall seem to thee to constitute a life of more vivid anduninterrupted happiness than that which thou so unreasonably pitiest asthe career of Glaucus the Athenian!--Farewell!\'Nearly Seventeen Centuries had rolled away when the City of Pompeii wasdisinterred from its silent tomb, all vivid with undimmed hues; itswalls fresh as if painted yesterday--not a hue faded on the rich mosaicof its floors--in its forum the half-finished columns as left by theworkman\'s hand--in its gardens the sacrificial tripod--in its halls thechest of treasure--in its baths the strigil--in its theatres the counterof admission--in its saloons the furniture and the lamp--in itstriclinia the fragments of the last feast--in its cubicula the perfumesand the rouge of faded beauty--and everywhere the bones and skeletons ofthose who once moved the springs of that minute yet gorgeous machine ofluxury and of life! In the house of Diomed, in the subterranean vaults,twenty skeletons (one of a babe) were discovered in one spot by thedoor, covered by a fine ashen dust, that had evidently been waftedslowly through the apertures, until it had filled the whole space.There were jewels and coins, candelabra for unavailing light, and winehardened in the amphorae for a prolongation of agonized life.  The sand,consolidated by damps, had taken the forms of the skeletons as in acast; and the traveler may yet see the impression of a female neck andbosom of young and round proportions--the trace of the fated Julia!  Itseems to the inquirer as if the air had been gradually changed into asulphurous vapor; the inmates of the vaults had rushed to the door, tofind it closed and blocked up by the scoria without, and in theirattempts to force it, had been suffocated with the atmosphere.In the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony hand, and nearit a bag of coins.  This is believed to have been the master of thehouse--the unfortunate Diomed, who had probably sought to escape by thegarden, and been destroyed either by the vapors or some fragment ofstone.  Beside some silver vases lay another skeleton, probably of aslave.The houses of Sallust and of Pansa, the Temple of Isis, with thejuggling concealments behind the statues--the lurking-place of its holyoracles--are now bared to the gaze of the curious.  In one of thechambers of that temple was found a huge skeleton with an axe beside it:two walls had been pierced by the axe--the victim could penetrate nofarther.  In the midst of the city was found another skeleton, by theside of which was a heap of coins, and many of the mystic ornaments ofthe fane of Isis.  Death had fallen upon him in his avarice, and Calenusperished simultaneously with Burbo!  As the excavators cleared onthrough the mass of ruin, they found the skeleton of a man literallysevered in two by a prostrate column; the skull was of so striking aconformation, so boldly marked in its intellectual as well as its worsephysical developments, that it has excited the constant speculation ofevery itinerant believer in the theories of Spurzheim who has gazed uponthat ruined palace of the mind.  Still, after the lapse of ages, thetraveler may survey that airy hall within whose cunning galleries andelaborate chambers once thought, reasoned, dreamed, and sinned, the soulof Arbaces the Egyptian.Viewing the various witnesses of a social system which has passed fromthe world for ever--a stranger, from that remote and barbarian Islewhich the Imperial Roman shivered when he named, paused amidst thedelights of the soft Campania and composed this history!

Nacquart,  Member of the Royal Academy of Medicine.  Dear Doctor--Here is one of the most carefully hewn stones in the  second course of the foundation of a literary edifice which I have  slowly and laboriously constructed. I wish to inscribe your name  upon it, as much to thank the man whose science once saved me as  to honor the friend of my daily life.                                                       De Balzac.THE LILY OF THE VALLEY  ENVOI  Felix de Vandenesse to Madame la Comtesse Natalie de Manerville:  I yield to your wishes. It is the privilege of the women whom we  love more than they love us to make the men who love them ignore  the ordinary rules of common-sense. To smooth the frown upon their  brow, to soften the pout upon their lips, what obstacles we  miraculously overcome! We shed our blood, we risk our future!  You exact the history of my past life; here it is. But remember  this, Natalie; in obeying you I crush under foot a reluctance  hitherto unconquerable. Why are you jealous of the sudden reveries  which overtake me in the midst of our happiness? Why show the  pretty anger of a petted woman when silence grasps me? Could you  not play upon the contradictions of my character without inquiring  into the causes of them? Are there secrets in your heart which  seek absolution through a knowledge of mine? Ah! Natalie, you have  guessed mine; and it is better you should know the whole truth.  Yes, my life is shadowed by a phantom; a word evokes it; it hovers  vaguely above me and about me; within my soul are solemn memories,  buried in its depths like those marine productions seen in calmest  weather and which the storms of ocean cast in fragments on the  shore.  The mental labor which the expression of ideas necessitates has  revived the old, old feelings which give me so much pain when they  come suddenly; and if in this confession of my past they break  forth in a way that wounds you, remember that you threatened to  punish me if I did not obey your wishes, and do not, therefore,  punish my obedience. I would that this, my confidence, might  increase your love.  Until we meet,  Felix.']"
85,2,Chapter 2,"['I. TWO CHILDHOODSTo what genius fed on tears shall we some day owe that most touching ofall elegies,--the tale of tortures borne silently by souls whose tenderroots find stony ground in the domestic soil, whose earliest buds aretorn apart by rancorous hands, whose flowers are touched by frost at themoment of their blossoming? What poet will sing the sorrows of the childwhose lips must suck a bitter breast, whose smiles are checked by thecruel fire of a stern eye? The tale that tells of such poor hearts,oppressed by beings placed about them to promote the development oftheir natures, would contain the true history of my childhood.What vanity could I have wounded,--I a child new-born? What moral orphysical infirmity caused by mother\'s coldness? Was I the child ofduty, whose birth is a mere chance, or was I one whose very life wasa reproach? Put to nurse in the country and forgotten by my family forover three years, I was treated with such indifference on my return tothe parental roof that even the servants pitied me. I do not know towhat feeling or happy accident I owed my rescue from this first neglect;as a child I was ignorant of it, as a man I have not discovered it. Farfrom easing my lot, my brother and my two sisters found amusement inmaking me suffer. The compact in virtue of which children hide eachother\'s peccadilloes, and which early teaches them the principlesof honor, was null and void in my case; more than that, I was oftenpunished for my brother\'s faults, without being allowed to prove theinjustice. The fawning spirit which seems instinctive in childrentaught my brother and sisters to join in the persecutions to which I wassubjected, and thus keep in the good graces of a mother whom theyfeared as much as I. Was this partly the effect of a childish love ofimitation; was it from a need of testing their powers; or was it simplythrough lack of pity? Perhaps these causes united to deprive me of thesweets of fraternal intercourse.Disinherited of all affection, I could love nothing; yet nature had mademe loving. Is there an angel who garners the sighs of feeling heartsrebuffed incessantly? If in many such hearts the crushed feelings turnto hatred, in mine they condensed and hollowed a depth from which, inafter years, they gushed forth upon my life. In many characters thehabit of trembling relaxes the fibres and begets fear, and fear endsin submission; hence, a weakness which emasculates a man, and makes himmore or less a slave. But in my case these perpetual tortures led to thedevelopment of a certain strength, which increased through exerciseand predisposed my spirit to the habit of moral resistance. Alwaysin expectation of some new grief--as the martyrs expected some freshblow--my whole being expressed, I doubt not, a sullen resignation whichsmothered the grace and gaiety of childhood, and gave me an appearanceof idiocy which seemed to justify my mother\'s threatening prophecies.The certainty of injustice prematurely roused my pride--that fruitof reason--and thus, no doubt, checked the evil tendencies which aneducation like mine encouraged.Though my mother neglected me I was sometimes the object of hersolicitude; she occasionally spoke of my education and seemed desirousof attending to it herself. Cold chills ran through me at such timeswhen I thought of the torture a daily intercourse with her would inflictupon me. I blessed the neglect in which I lived, and rejoiced that Icould stay alone in the garden and play with the pebbles and watch theinsects and gaze into the blueness of the sky. Though my lonelinessnaturally led me to reverie, my liking for contemplation was firstaroused by an incident which will give you an idea of my early troubles.So little notice was taken of me that the governess occasionally forgotto send me to bed. One evening I was peacefully crouching under afig-tree, watching a star with that passion of curiosity which takespossession of a child\'s mind, and to which my precocious melancholygave a sort of sentimental intuition. My sisters were playing aboutand laughing; I heard their distant chatter like an accompaniment to mythoughts. After a while the noise ceased and darkness fell. My motherhappened to notice my absence. To escape blame, our governess, aterrible Mademoiselle Caroline, worked upon my mother\'s fears,--told herI had a horror of my home and would long ago have run away if she hadnot watched me; that I was not stupid but sullen; and that in all herexperience of children she had never known one of so bad a dispositionas mine. She pretended to search for me. I answered as soon as I wascalled, and she came to the fig-tree, where she very well knew I was.""What are you doing there?"" she asked. ""Watching a star."" ""You werenot watching a star,"" said my mother, who was listening on her balcony;""children of your age know nothing of astronomy."" ""Ah, madame,"" criedMademoiselle Caroline, ""he has opened the faucet of the reservoir; thegarden is inundated!"" Then there was a general excitement. The fact wasthat my sisters had amused themselves by turning the cock to see thewater flow, but a sudden spurt wet them all over and frightened themso much that they ran away without closing it. Accused and convictedof this piece of mischief and told that I lied when I denied it, I wasseverely punished. Worse than all, I was jeered at for my pretended loveof the stars and forbidden to stay in the garden after dark.Such tyrannical restrains intensify a passion in the hearts of childreneven more than in those of men; children think of nothing but theforbidden thing, which then becomes irresistibly attractive to them. Iwas often whipped for my star. Unable to confide in my kind, I told itall my troubles in that delicious inward prattle with which we stammerour first ideas, just as once we stammered our first words. At twelveyears of age, long after I was at school, I still watched that starwith indescribable delight,--so deep and lasting are the impressions wereceive in the dawn of life.My brother Charles, five years older than I and as handsome a boy as henow is a man, was the favorite of my father, the idol of my mother, andconsequently the sovereign of the house. He was robust and well-made,and had a tutor. I, puny and even sickly, was sent at five years of ageas day pupil to a school in the town; taken in the morning and broughtback at night by my father\'s valet. I was sent with a scanty lunch,while my school-fellows brought plenty of good food. This triflingcontrast between my privations and their prosperity made me sufferdeeply. The famous potted pork prepared at Tours and called ""rillettes""and ""rillons"" was the chief feature of their mid-day meal, betweenthe early breakfast and the parent\'s dinner, which was ready when wereturned from school. This preparation of meat, much prized by certaingourmands, is seldom seen at Tours on aristocratic tables; if I hadever heard of it before I went to school, I certainly had never hadthe happiness of seeing that brown mess spread on slices of bread andbutter. Nevertheless, my desire for those ""rillons"" was so great that itgrew to be a fixed idea, like the longing of an elegant Parisian duchessfor the stews cooked by a porter\'s wife,--longings which, being a woman,she found means to satisfy. Children guess each other\'s covetousness,just as you are able to read a man\'s love, by the look in the eyes;consequently I became an admirable butt for ridicule. My comrades,nearly all belonging to the lower bourgeoisie, would show me their""rillons"" and ask if I knew how they were made and where they were sold,and why it was that I never had any. They licked their lips as theytalked of them--scraps of pork pressed in their own fat and looking likecooked truffles; they inspected my lunch-basket, and finding nothingbetter than Olivet cheese or dried fruits, they plagued mewith questions: ""Is that all you have? have you really nothingelse?""--speeches which made me realize the difference between my brotherand myself.This contrast between my own abandonment and the happiness of othersnipped the roses of my childhood and blighted my budding youth. Thefirst time that I, mistaking my comrades\' actions for generosity, putforth my hand to take the dainty I had so long coveted and which was nowhypocritically held out to me, my tormentor pulled back his slice to thegreat delight of his comrades who were expecting that result. If nobleand distinguished minds are, as we often find them, capable of vanity,can we blame the child who weeps when despised and jeered at? Under sucha trial many boys would have turned into gluttons and cringing beggars.I fought to escape my persecutors. The courage of despair made meformidable; but I was hated, and thus had no protection againsttreachery. One evening as I left school I was struck in the back bya handful of small stones tied in a handkerchief. When the valet, whopunished the perpetrator, told this to my mother she exclaimed: ""Thatdreadful child! he will always be a torment to us.""Finding that I inspired in my schoolmates the same repulsion that wasfelt for me by my family, I sank into a horrible distrust of myself. Asecond fall of snow checked the seeds that were germinating in my soul.The boys whom I most liked were notorious scamps; this fact roused mypride and I held aloof. Again I was shut up within myself and had novent for the feelings with which my heart was full. The master of theschool, observing that I was gloomy, disliked by my comrades, and alwaysalone, confirmed the family verdict as to my sulky temper. As soon as Icould read and write, my mother transferred me to Pont-le-Voy, a schoolin charge of Oratorians who took boys of my age into a form called the""class of the Latin steps"" where dull lads with torpid brains were aptto linger.There I remained eight years without seeing my family; living the lifeof a pariah,--partly for the following reason. I received but threefrancs a month pocket-money, a sum barely sufficient to buy the pens,ink, paper, knives, and rules which we were forced to supply ourselves.Unable to buy stilts or skipping-ropes, or any of the things that wereused in the playground, I was driven out of the games; to gain admissionon suffrage I should have had to toady the rich and flatter the strongof my division. My heart rose against either of these meannesses, which,however, most children readily employ. I lived under a tree, lost indejected thought, or reading the books distributed to us monthly by thelibrarian. How many griefs were in the shadow of that solitude; whatgenuine anguish filled my neglected life! Imagine what my sore heartfelt when, at the first distribution of prizes,--of which I obtainedthe two most valued, namely, for theme and for translation,--neither myfather nor my mother was present in the theatre when I came forward toreceive the awards amid general acclamations, although the building wasfilled with the relatives of all my comrades. Instead of kissing thedistributor, according to custom, I burst into tears and threw myself onhis breast. That night I burned my crowns in the stove. The parents ofthe other boys were in town for a whole week preceding the distributionof the prizes, and my comrades departed joyfully the next day; while I,whose father and mother were only a few miles distant, remained at theschool with the ""outremers,""--a name given to scholars whose familieswere in the colonies or in foreign countries.You will notice throughout how my unhappiness increased in proportion asthe social spheres on which I entered widened. God knows what efforts Imade to weaken the decree which condemned me to live within myself! Whathopes, long cherished with eagerness of soul, were doomed to perish ina day! To persuade my parents to come and see me, I wrote them lettersfull of feeling, too emphatically worded, it may be; but surely suchletters ought not to have drawn upon me my mother\'s reprimand, coupledwith ironical reproaches for my style. Not discouraged even then,I implored the help of my sisters, to whom I always wrote on theirbirthdays and fete-days with the persistence of a neglected child; butit was all in vain. As the day for the distribution of prizes approachedI redoubled my entreaties, and told of my expected triumphs. Misled bymy parents\' silence, I expected them with a beating heart. I told myschoolfellows they were coming; and then, when the old porter\'s stepsounded in the corridors as he called my happy comrades one by one toreceive their friends, I was sick with expectation. Never did that oldman call my name!One day, when I accused myself to my confessor of having cursed my life,he pointed to the skies, where grew, he said, the promised palm for the""Beati qui lugent"" of the Saviour. From the period of my first communionI flung myself into the mysterious depths of prayer, attracted toreligious ideas whose moral fairyland so fascinates young spirits.Burning with ardent faith, I prayed to God to renew in my behalf themiracles I had read of in martyrology. At five years of age I fled tomy star; at twelve I took refuge in the sanctuary. My ecstasybrought dreams unspeakable, which fed my imagination, fostered mysusceptibilities, and strengthened my thinking powers. I have oftenattributed those sublime visions to the guardian angel charged withmoulding my spirit to its divine destiny; they endowed my soul with thefaculty of seeing the inner soul of things; they prepared my heart forthe magic craft which makes a man a poet when the fatal power is his tocompare what he feels within him with reality,--the great things aimedfor with the small things gained. Those visions wrote upon my brain abook in which I read that which I must voice; they laid upon my lips thecoal of utterance.My father having conceived some doubts as to the tendency of theOratorian teachings, took me from Pont-le-Voy, and sent me to Paris toan institution in the Marais. I was then fifteen. When examined as tomy capacity, I, who was in the rhetoric class at Pont-le-Voy, waspronounced worthy of the third class. The sufferings I had endured in myfamily and in school were continued under another form during my stayat the Lepitre Academy. My father gave me no money; I was to be fed,clothed, and stuffed with Latin and Greek, for a sum agreed on. Duringmy school life I came in contact with over a thousand comrades; but Inever met with such an instance of neglect and indifference as mine.Monsieur Lepitre, who was fanatically attached to the Bourbons, had hadrelations with my father at the time when all devoted royalists wereendeavoring to bring about the escape of Marie Antoinette from theTemple. They had lately renewed acquaintance; and Monsieur Lepitrethought himself obliged to repair my father\'s oversight, and to give mea small sum monthly. But not being authorized to do so, the amount wassmall indeed.The Lepitre establishment was in the old Joyeuse mansion where, as inall seignorial houses, there was a porter\'s lodge. During a recess,which preceded the hour when the man-of-all-work took us to theCharlemagne Lyceum, the well-to-do pupils used to breakfast with theporter, named Doisy. Monsieur Lepitre was either ignorant of the fact orhe connived at this arrangement with Doisy, a regular smuggler whom itwas the pupils\' interest to protect,--he being the secret guardianof their pranks, the safe confidant of their late returns and theirintermediary for obtaining forbidden books. Breakfast on a cup of""cafe-au-lait"" is an aristocratic habit, explained by the high pricesto which colonial products rose under Napoleon. If the use of sugarand coffee was a luxury to our parents, with us it was the sign ofself-conscious superiority. Doisy gave credit, for he reckoned on thesisters and aunts of the pupils, who made it a point of honor to paytheir debts. I resisted the blandishments of his place for a long time.If my judges knew the strength of its seduction, the heroic efforts Imade after stoicism, the repressed desires of my long resistance, theywould pardon my final overthrow. But, child as I was, could I have thegrandeur of soul that scorns the scorn of others? Moreover, I may havefelt the promptings of several social vices whose power was increased bymy longings.About the end of the second year my father and mother came to Paris. Mybrother had written me the day of their arrival. He lived in Paris, buthad never been to see me. My sisters, he said, were of the party; wewere all to see Paris together. The first day we were to dine in thePalais-Royal, so as to be near the Theatre-Francais. In spite of theintoxication such a programme of unhoped-for delights excited, my joywas dampened by the wind of a coming storm, which those who are usedto unhappiness apprehend instinctively. I was forced to own a debt ofa hundred francs to the Sieur Doisy, who threatened to ask my parentshimself for the money. I bethought me of making my brother the emissaryof Doisy, the mouth-piece of my repentance and the mediator of pardon.My father inclined to forgiveness, but my mother was pitiless; her darkblue eye froze me; she fulminated cruel prophecies: ""What should Ibe later if at seventeen years of age I committed such follies? Was Ireally a son of hers? Did I mean to ruin my family? Did I think myselfthe only child of the house? My brother Charles\'s career, already begun,required large outlay, amply deserved by his conduct which did honor tothe family, while mine would always disgrace it. Did I know nothing ofthe value of money, and what I cost them? Of what use were coffee andsugar to my education? Such conduct was the first step into all thevices.""After enduring the shock of this torrent which rasped my soul, I wassent back to school in charge of my brother. I lost the dinner at theFreres Provencaux, and was deprived of seeing Talma in Britannicus.Such was my first interview with my mother after a separation of twelveyears.When I had finished school my father left me under the guardianship ofMonsieur Lepitre. I was to study the higher mathematics, follow a courseof law for one year, and begin philosophy. Allowed to study in my ownroom and released from the classes, I expected a truce with trouble.But, in spite of my nineteen years, perhaps because of them, my fatherpersisted in the system which had sent me to school without food, to anacademy without pocket-money, and had driven me into debt to Doisy. Verylittle money was allowed to me, and what can you do in Paris withoutmoney? Moreover, my freedom was carefully chained up. Monsieur Lepitresent me to the law school accompanied by a man-of-all-work who handed meover to the professor and fetched me home again. A young girl would havebeen treated with less precaution than my mother\'s fears insisted on forme. Paris alarmed my parents, and justly. Students are secretly engagedin the same occupation which fills the minds of young ladies in theirboarding-schools. Do what you will, nothing can prevent the latter fromtalking of lovers, or the former of women. But in Paris, and especiallyat this particular time, such talk among young lads was influenced bythe oriental and sultanic atmosphere and customs of the Palais-Royal.The Palais-Royal was an Eldorado of love where the ingots melted away incoin; there virgin doubts were over; there curiosity was appeased. ThePalais-Royal and I were two asymptotes bearing one towards the other,yet unable to meet. Fate miscarried all my attempts. My father hadpresented me to one of my aunts who lived in the Ile St. Louis. With herI was to dine on Sundays and Thursdays, escorted to the house by eitherMonsieur or Madame Lepitre, who went out themselves on those days andwere to call for me on their way home. Singular amusement for ayoung lad! My aunt, the Marquise de Listomere, was a great lady, ofceremonious habits, who would never have dreamed of offering me money.Old as a cathedral, painted like a miniature, sumptuous in dress, shelived in her great house as though Louis XV. were not dead, and saw nonebut old women and men of a past day,--a fossil society which made methink I was in a graveyard. No one spoke to me and I had not the courageto speak first. Cold and alien looks made me ashamed of my youth,which seemed to annoy them. I counted on this indifference to aid me incertain plans; I was resolved to escape some day directly after dinnerand rush to the Palais-Royal. Once seated at whist my aunt would pay noattention to me. Jean, the footman, cared little for Monsieur Lepitreand would have aided me; but on the day I chose for my adventure thatluckless dinner was longer than usual,--either because the jaws employedwere worn out or the false teeth more imperfect. At last, between eightand nine o\'clock, I reached the staircase, my heart beating like that ofBianca Capello on the day of her flight; but when the porter pulled thecord I beheld in the street before me Monsieur Lepitre\'s hackney-coach,and I heard his pursy voice demanding me!Three times did fate interpose between the hell of the Palais-Royal andthe heaven of my youth. On the day when I, ashamed at twenty years ofage of my own ignorance, determined to risk all dangers to put an endto it, at the very moment when I was about to run away from MonsieurLepitre as he got into the coach,--a difficult process, for he wasas fat as Louis XVIII. and club-footed,--well, can you believe it, mymother arrived in a post-chaise! Her glance arrested me; I stoodstill, like a bird before a snake. What fate had brought her there? Thesimplest thing in the world. Napoleon was then making his last efforts.My father, who foresaw the return of the Bourbons, had come to Pariswith my mother to advise my brother, who was employed in the imperialdiplomatic service. My mother was to take me back with her, out of theway of dangers which seemed, to those who followed the march of eventsintelligently, to threaten the capital. In a few minutes, as it were, Iwas taken out of Paris, at the very moment when my life there was aboutto become fatal to me.The tortures of imagination excited by repressed desires, the wearinessof a life depressed by constant privations had driven me to study, justas men, weary of fate, confine themselves in a cloister. To me,study had become a passion, which might even be fatal to my health byimprisoning me at a period of life when young men ought to yield to thebewitching activities of their springtide youth.This slight sketch of my boyhood, in which you, Natalie, can readilyperceive innumerable songs of woe, was needful to explain to you itsinfluence on my future life. At twenty years of age, and affected bymany morbid elements, I was still small and thin and pale. My soul,filled with the will to do, struggled with a body that seemed weakly,but which, in the words of an old physician at Tours, was undergoing itsfinal fusion into a temperament of iron. Child in body and old in mind,I had read and thought so much that I knew life metaphysically at itshighest reaches at the moment when I was about to enter the tortuousdifficulties of its defiles and the sandy roads of its plains. A strangechance had held me long in that delightful period when the soul awakesto its first tumults, to its desires for joy, and the savor of lifeis fresh. I stood in the period between puberty and manhood,--the oneprolonged by my excessive study, the other tardily developing its livingshoots. No young man was ever more thoroughly prepared to feel and tolove. To understand my history, let your mind dwell on that pure timeof youth when the mouth is innocent of falsehood; when the glance ofthe eye is honest, though veiled by lids which droop from timiditycontradicting desire; when the soul bends not to worldly Jesuitism,and the heart throbs as violently from trepidation as from the generousimpulses of young emotion.I need say nothing of the journey I made with my mother from Paris toTours. The coldness of her behavior repressed me. At each relay I triedto speak; but a look, a word from her frightened away the speeches I hadbeen meditating. At Orleans, where we had passed the night, my mothercomplained of my silence. I threw myself at her feet and clasped herknees; with tears I opened my heart. I tried to touch hers by theeloquence of my hungry love in accents that might have moved astepmother. She replied that I was playing comedy. I complained that shehad abandoned me. She called me an unnatural child. My whole nature wasso wrung that at Blois I went upon the bridge to drown myself in theLoire. The height of the parapet prevented my suicide.When I reached home, my two sisters, who did not know me, showedmore surprise than tenderness. Afterwards, however, they seemed, bycomparison, to be full of kindness towards me. I was given a room on thethird story. You will understand the extent of my hardships when I tellyou that my mother left me, a young man of twenty, without other linenthan my miserable school outfit, or any other outside clothes than thoseI had long worn in Paris. If I ran from one end of the room to the otherto pick up her handkerchief, she took it with the cold thanks a ladygives to her footman. Driven to watch her to find if there were any softspot where I could fasten the rootlets of affection, I came to seeher as she was,--a tall, spare woman, given to cards, egotistical andinsolent, like all the Listomeres, who count insolence as part of theirdowry. She saw nothing in life except duties to be fulfilled. Allcold women whom I have known made, as she did, a religion of duty; shereceived our homage as a priest receives the incense of the mass. Myelder brother appeared to absorb the trifling sentiment of maternitywhich was in her nature. She stabbed us constantly with her sharpirony,--the weapon of those who have no heart,--and which she usedagainst us, who could make her no reply.Notwithstanding these thorny hindrances, the instinctive sentimentshave so many roots, the religious fear inspired by a mother whom itis dangerous to displease holds by so many threads, that the sublimemistake--if I may so call it--of our love for our mother lasted untilthe day, much later in our lives, when we judged her finally. Thisterrible despotism drove from my mind all thoughts of the voluptuousenjoyments I had dreamed of finding at Tours. In despair I took refugein my father\'s library, where I set myself to read every book I did notknow. These long periods of hard study saved me from contact with mymother; but they aggravated the dangers of my moral condition. Sometimesmy eldest sister--she who afterwards married our cousin, the Marquis deListomere--tried to comfort me, without, however, being able to calm theirritation to which I was a victim. I desired to die.Great events, of which I knew nothing, were then in preparation. The Ducd\'Angouleme, who had left Bordeaux to join Louis XVIII. in Paris, wasreceived in every town through which he passed with ovations inspired bythe enthusiasm felt throughout old France at the return of the Bourbons.Touraine was aroused for its legitimate princes; the town itself wasin a flutter, every window decorated, the inhabitants in their Sundayclothes, a festival in preparation, and that nameless excitement in theair which intoxicates, and which gave me a strong desire to be presentat the ball given by the duke. When I summoned courage to make thisrequest of my mother, who was too ill to go herself, she becameextremely angry. ""Had I come from Congo?"" she inquired. ""How could Isuppose that our family would not be represented at the ball? Inthe absence of my father and brother, of course it was my duty to bepresent. Had I no mother? Was she not always thinking of the welfare ofher children?""In a moment the semi-disinherited son had become a personage! I was moredumfounded by my importance than by the deluge of ironical reasoningwith which my mother received my request. I questioned my sisters, andthen discovered that my mother, who liked such theatrical plots,was already attending to my clothes. The tailors in Tours were fullyoccupied by the sudden demands of their regular customers, and my motherwas forced to employ her usual seamstress, who--according to provincialcustom--could do all kinds of sewing. A bottle-blue coat had beensecretly made for me, after a fashion, and silk stockings and pumpsprovided; waistcoats were then worn short, so that I could wear oneof my father\'s; and for the first time in my life I had a shirt with afrill, the pleatings of which puffed out my chest and were gatheredin to the knot of my cravat. When dressed in this apparel I looked solittle like myself that my sister\'s compliments nerved me to faceall Touraine at the ball. But it was a bold enterprise. Thanks to myslimness I slipped into a tent set up in the gardens of the Papionhouse, and found a place close to the armchair in which the duke wasseated. Instantly I was suffocated by the heat, and dazzled by thelights, the scarlet draperies, the gilded ornaments, the dresses, andthe diamonds of the first public ball I had ever witnessed. I was pushedhither and thither by a mass of men and women, who hustled each other ina cloud of dust. The brazen clash of military music was drowned in thehurrahs and acclamations of ""Long live the Duc d\'Angouleme! Long livethe King! Long live the Bourbons!"" The ball was an outburst of pent-upenthusiasm, where each man endeavored to outdo the rest in his fiercehaste to worship the rising sun,--an exhibition of partisan greed whichleft me unmoved, or rather, it disgusted me and drove me back withinmyself.Swept onward like a straw in the whirlwind, I was seized with a childishdesire to be the Duc d\'Angouleme himself, to be one of these princesparading before an awed assemblage. This silly fancy of a Tourangean ladroused an ambition to which my nature and the surrounding circumstanceslent dignity. Who would not envy such worship?--a magnificent repetitionof which I saw a few months later, when all Paris rushed to the feetof the Emperor on his return from Elba. The sense of this dominionexercised over the masses, whose feelings and whose very life are thusmerged into one soul, dedicated me then and thenceforth to glory, thatpriestess who slaughters the Frenchmen of to-day as the Druidess oncesacrificed the Gauls.Suddenly I met the woman who was destined to spur these ambitiousdesires and to crown them by sending me into the heart of royalty.Too timid to ask any one to dance,--fearing, moreover, to confuse thefigures,--I naturally became very awkward, and did not know what todo with my arms and legs. Just as I was suffering severely from thepressure of the crowd an officer stepped on my feet, swollen by the newleather of my shoes as well as by the heat. This disgusted me with thewhole affair. It was impossible to get away; but I took refuge in acorner of a room at the end of an empty bench, where I sat withfixed eyes, motionless and sullen. Misled by my puny appearance, awoman--taking me for a sleepy child--slid softly into the place besideme, with the motion of a bird as she drops upon her nest. Instantly Ibreathed the woman-atmosphere, which irradiated my soul as, in afterdays, oriental poesy has shone there. I looked at my neighbor, and wasmore dazzled by that vision than I had been by the scene of the fete.If you have understood this history of my early life you will guessthe feelings which now welled up within me. My eyes rested suddenlyon white, rounded shoulders where I would fain have laid myhead,--shoulders faintly rosy, which seemed to blush as if uncovered forthe first time; modest shoulders, that possessed a soul, and reflectedlight from their satin surface as from a silken texture. These shoulderswere parted by a line along which my eyes wandered. I raised myself tosee the bust and was spell-bound by the beauty of the bosom, chastelycovered with gauze, where blue-veined globes of perfect outline weresoftly hidden in waves of lace. The slightest details of the head wereeach and all enchantments which awakened infinite delights withinme; the brilliancy of the hair laid smoothly above a neck as softand velvety as a child\'s, the white lines drawn by the comb where myimagination ran as along a dewy path,--all these things put me, as itwere, beside myself. Glancing round to be sure that no one saw me, Ithrew myself upon those shoulders as a child upon the breast of itsmother, kissing them as I laid my head there. The woman uttered apiercing cry, which the noise of the music drowned; she turned, sawme, and exclaimed, ""Monsieur!"" Ah! had she said, ""My little lad, whatpossesses you?"" I might have killed her; but at the word ""Monsieur!"" hottears fell from my eyes. I was petrified by a glance of saintly anger,by a noble face crowned with a diadem of golden hair in harmony withthe shoulders I adored. The crimson of offended modesty glowed on hercheeks, though already it was appeased by the pardoning instinct ofa woman who comprehends a frenzy which she inspires, and divines theinfinite adoration of those repentant tears. She moved away with thestep and carriage of a queen.I then felt the ridicule of my position; for the first time I realizedthat I was dressed like the monkey of a barrel organ. I was ashamed.There I stood, stupefied,--tasting the fruit that I had stolen,conscious of the warmth upon my lips, repenting not, and following withmy eyes the woman who had come down to me from heaven. Sick with thefirst fever of the heart I wandered through the rooms, unable to findmine Unknown, until at last I went home to bed, another man.A new soul, a soul with rainbow wings, had burst its chrysalis.Descending from the azure wastes where I had long admired her, my starhad come to me a woman, with undiminished lustre and purity. I loved,knowing naught of love. How strange a thing, this first irruption of thekeenest human emotion in the heart of a man! I had seen pretty women inother places, but none had made the slightest impression upon me.Can there be an appointed hour, a conjunction of stars, a union ofcircumstances, a certain woman among all others to awaken an exclusivepassion at the period of life when love includes the whole sex?The thought that my Elect lived in Touraine made the air I breatheddelicious; the blue of the sky seemed bluer than I had ever yet seen it.I raved internally, but externally I was seriously ill, and my motherhad fears, not unmingled with remorse. Like animals who know when dangeris near, I hid myself away in the garden to think of the kiss that Ihad stolen. A few days after this memorable ball my mother attributed myneglect of study, my indifference to her tyrannical looks and sarcasms,and my gloomy behavior to the condition of my health. The country, thatperpetual remedy for ills that doctors cannot cure, seemed to her thebest means of bringing me out of my apathy. She decided that I shouldspend a few weeks at Frapesle, a chateau on the Indre midway betweenMontbazon and Azay-le-Rideau, which belonged to a friend of hers, towhom, no doubt, she gave private instructions.By the day when I thus for the first time gained my liberty I had swumso vigorously in Love\'s ocean that I had well-nigh crossed it. I knewnothing of mine unknown lady, neither her name, nor where to findher; to whom, indeed, could I speak of her? My sensitive nature soexaggerated the inexplicable fears which beset all youthful hearts atthe first approach of love that I began with the melancholy which oftenends a hopeless passion. I asked nothing better than to roam about thecountry, to come and go and live in the fields. With the courage ofa child that fears no failure, in which there is something reallychivalrous, I determined to search every chateau in Touraine, travellingon foot, and saying to myself as each old tower came in sight, ""She isthere!""Accordingly, of a Thursday morning I left Tours by the barrier ofSaint-Eloy, crossed the bridges of Saint-Sauveur, reached Poncher whoseevery house I examined, and took the road to Chinon. For the firsttime in my life I could sit down under a tree or walk fast or slow asI pleased without being dictated to by any one. To a poor lad crushedunder all sorts of despotism (which more or less does weigh upon allyouth) the first employment of freedom, even though it be expended uponnothing, lifts the soul with irrepressible buoyancy. Several reasonscombined to make that day one of enchantment. During my school years Ihad never been taken to walk more than two or three miles from a city;yet there remained in my mind among the earliest recollections of mychildhood that feeling for the beautiful which the scenery about Toursinspires. Though quite untaught as to the poetry of such a landscape,I was, unknown to myself, critical upon it, like those who imagine theideal of art without knowing anything of its practice.To reach the chateau of Frapesle, foot-passengers, or thoseon horseback, shorten the way by crossing the Charlemagnemoors,--uncultivated tracts of land lying on the summit of the plateauwhich separates the valley of the Cher from that of the Indre, and overwhich there is a cross-road leading to Champy. These moors are flat andsandy, and for more than three miles are dreary enough until you reach,through a clump of woods, the road to Sache, the name of the townshipin which Frapesle stands. This road, which joins that of Chinon beyondBallan, skirts an undulating plain to the little hamlet of Artanne. Herewe come upon a valley, which begins at Montbazon, ends at the Loire,and seems to rise and fall,--to bound, as it were,--beneath the chateausplaced on its double hillsides,--a splendid emerald cup, in the depthsof which flow the serpentine lines of the river Indre. I gazed at thisscene with ineffable delight, for which the gloomy moor-land and thefatigue of the sandy walk had prepared me.""If that woman, the flower of her sex, does indeed inhabit this earth,she is here, on this spot.""Thus musing, I leaned against a walnut-tree, beneath which I have restedfrom that day to this whenever I return to my dear valley. Beneath thattree, the confidant of my thoughts, I ask myself what changes there arein me since last I stood there.My heart deceived me not--she lived there; the first castle that I sawon the slope of a hill was the dwelling that held her. As I sat beneathmy nut-tree, the mid-day sun was sparkling on the slates of her roof andthe panes of her windows. Her cambric dress made the white line which Isaw among the vines of an arbor. She was, as you know already withoutas yet knowing anything, the Lily of this valley, where she grew forheaven, filling it with the fragrance of her virtues. Love, infinitelove, without other sustenance than the vision, dimly seen, of which mysoul was full, was there, expressed to me by that long ribbon of waterflowing in the sunshine between the grass-green banks, by the lines ofthe poplars adorning with their mobile laces that vale of love, by theoak-woods coming down between the vineyards to the shore, which theriver curved and rounded as it chose, and by those dim varying horizonsas they fled confusedly away.If you would see nature beautiful and virgin as a bride, go there of aspring morning. If you would still the bleeding wounds of your heart,return in the last days of autumn. In the spring, Love beats his wingsbeneath the broad blue sky; in the autumn, we think of those who are nomore. The lungs diseased breathe in a blessed purity; the eyes will reston golden copses which impart to the soul their peaceful stillness. Atthis moment, when I stood there for the first time, the mills uponthe brooksides gave a voice to the quivering valley; the poplars werelaughing as they swayed; not a cloud was in the sky; the birds sang,the crickets chirped,--all was melody. Do not ask me again why I loveTouraine. I love it, not as we love our cradle, not as we love the oasisin a desert; I love it as an artist loves art; I love it less than Ilove you; but without Touraine, perhaps I might not now be living.Without knowing why, my eyes reverted ever to that white spot, to thewoman who shone in that garden as the bell of a convolvulus shines amidthe underbrush, and wilts if touched. Moved to the soul, I descendedthe slope and soon saw a village, which the superabounding poetry thatfilled my heart made me fancy without an equal. Imagine three millsplaced among islands of graceful outline crowned with groves of treesand rising from a field of water,--for what other name can I give tothat aquatic vegetation, so verdant, so finely colored, which carpetedthe river, rose above its surface and undulated upon it, yielding to itscaprices and swaying to the turmoil of the water when the mill-wheelslashed it. Here and there were mounds of gravel, against which thewavelets broke in fringes that shimmered in the sunlight. Amaryllis,water-lilies, reeds, and phloxes decorated the banks with their glorioustapestry. A trembling bridge of rotten planks, the abutments swathedwith flowers, and the hand-rails green with perennials and velvetmosses drooping to the river but not falling to it; mouldering boats,fishing-nets; the monotonous sing-song of a shepherd; ducks paddlingamong the islands or preening on the ""jard,""--a name given to the coarsesand which the Loire brings down; the millers, with their caps overone ear, busily loading their mules,--all these details made the scenebefore me one of primitive simplicity. Imagine, also, beyond the bridgetwo or three farm-houses, a dove-cote, turtle-doves, thirty or moredilapidated cottages, separated by gardens, by hedges of honeysuckle,clematis, and jasmine; a dunghill beside each door, and cocks and hensabout the road. Such is the village of Pont-de-Ruan, a picturesquelittle hamlet leading up to an old church full of character, a churchof the days of the Crusades, such a one as painters desire for theirpictures. Surround this scene with ancient walnut-trees and slim youngpoplars with their pale-gold leaves; dot graceful buildings here andthere along the grassy slopes where sight is lost beneath the vaporous,warm sky, and you will have some idea of one of the points of view ofthis most lovely region.I followed the road to Sache along the left bank of the river, noticingcarefully the details of the hills on the opposite shore. At length Ireached a park embellished with centennial trees, which I knew to bethat of Frapesle. I arrived just as the bell was ringing for breakfast.After the meal, my host, who little suspected that I had walked fromTours, carried me over his estate, from the borders of which I saw thevalley on all sides under its many aspects,--here through a vista, thereto its broad extent; often my eyes were drawn to the horizon along thegolden blade of the Loire, where the sails made fantastic figures amongthe currents as they flew before the wind. As we mounted a crest Icame in sight of the chateau d\'Azay, like a diamond of many facets ina setting of the Indre, standing on wooden piles concealed by flowers.Farther on, in a hollow, I saw the romantic masses of the chateauof Sache, a sad retreat though full of harmony; too sad for thesuperficial, but dear to a poet with a soul in pain. I, too, came tolove its silence, its great gnarled trees, and the nameless mysteriousinfluence of its solitary valley. But now, each time that we reachedan opening towards the neighboring slope which gave to view the prettycastle I had first noticed in the morning, I stopped to look at it withpleasure.""Hey!"" said my host, reading in my eyes the sparkling desires whichyouth so ingenuously betrays, ""so you scent from afar a pretty woman asa dog scents game!""I did not like the speech, but I asked the name of the castle and of itsowner.""It is Clochegourde,"" he replied; ""a pretty house belonging to the Comtede Mortsauf, the head of an historic family in Touraine, whose fortunedates from the days of Louis XI., and whose name tells the story towhich they owe their arms and their distinction. Monsieur de Mortsaufis descended from a man who survived the gallows. The family bear: Or,a cross potent and counter-potent sable, charged with a fleur-de-lis or;and \'Dieu saulve le Roi notre Sire,\' for motto. The count settled hereafter the return of the emigration. The estate belongs to his wife, ademoiselle de Lenoncourt, of the house of Lenoncourt-Givry which is nowdying out. Madame de Mortsauf is an only daughter. The limited fortuneof the family contrasts strangely with the distinction of their names;either from pride, or, possibly, from necessity, they never leaveClochegourde and see no company. Until now their attachment to theBourbons explained this retirement, but the return of the king has notchanged their way of living. When I came to reside here last year I paidthem a visit of courtesy; they returned it and invited us to dinner; thewinter separated us for some months, and political events kept me awayfrom Frapesle until recently. Madame de Mortsauf is a woman who wouldhold the highest position wherever she might be.""""Does she often come to Tours?""""She never goes there. However,"" he added, correcting himself, ""she didgo there lately to the ball given to the Duc d\'Angouleme, who was verygracious to her husband.""""It was she!"" I exclaimed.""She! who?""""A woman with beautiful shoulders.""""You will meet a great many women with beautiful shoulders in Touraine,""he said, laughing. ""But if you are not tired we can cross the riverand call at Clochegourde and you shall renew acquaintance with thoseparticular shoulders.""I agreed, not without a blush of shame and pleasure. About four o\'clockwe reached the little chateau on which my eyes had fastened from thefirst. The building, which is finely effective in the landscape, is inreality very modest. It has five windows on the front; those at eachend of the facade, looking south, project about twelve feet,--anarchitectural device which gives the idea of two towers and adds graceto the structure. The middle window serves as a door from which youdescend through a double portico into a terraced garden which joins thenarrow strip of grass-land that skirts the Indre along its whole course.Though this meadow is separated from the lower terrace, which is shadedby a double line of acacias and Japanese ailanthus, by the country road,it nevertheless appears from the house to be a part of the garden, forthe road is sunken and hemmed in on one side by the terrace, on theother side by a Norman hedge. The terraces being very well managedput enough distance between the house and the river to avoid theinconvenience of too great proximity to water, without losing the charmsof it. Below the house are the stables, coach-house, green-houses,and kitchen, the various openings to which form an arcade. The roof ischarmingly rounded at the angles, and bears mansarde windows with carvedmullions and leaden finials on their gables. This roof, no doubt muchneglected during the Revolution, is stained by a sort of mildew producedby lichens and the reddish moss which grows on houses exposed to thesun. The glass door of the portico is surmounted by a little towerwhich holds the bell, and on which is carved the escutcheon of theBlamont-Chauvry family, to which Madame de Mortsauf belonged, asfollows: Gules, a pale vair, flanked quarterly by two hands clasped or,and two lances in chevron sable. The motto, ""Voyez tous, nul ne touche!""struck me greatly. The supporters, a griffin and dragon gules, enchainedor, made a pretty effect in the carving. The Revolution has damaged theducal crown and the crest, which was a palm-tree vert with fruit or.Senart, the secretary of the committee of public safety was bailiff ofSache before 1781, which explains this destruction.These arrangements give an elegant air to the little castle, dainty asa flower, which seems to scarcely rest upon the earth. Seen from thevalley the ground-floor appears to be the first story; but on theother side it is on a level with a broad gravelled path leading to agrass-plot, on which are several flower-beds. To right and left arevineyards, orchards, and a few acres of tilled land planted withchestnut-trees which surround the house, the ground falling rapidly tothe Indre, where other groups of trees of variegated shades of green,chosen by Nature herself, are spread along the shore. I admired thesegroups, so charmingly disposed, as we mounted the hilly road whichborders Clochegourde; I breathed an atmosphere of happiness. Hasthe moral nature, like the physical nature, its own electricalcommunications and its rapid changes of temperature? My heart wasbeating at the approach of events then unrevealed which were to changeit forever, just as animals grow livelier when foreseeing fine weather.This day, so marked in my life, lacked no circumstance that was neededto solemnize it. Nature was adorned like a woman to meet her lover.My soul heard her voice for the first time; my eyes worshipped her,as fruitful, as varied as my imagination had pictured her in thoseschool-dreams the influence of which I have tried in a few unskilfulwords to explain to you, for they were to me an Apocalypse in which mylife was figuratively foretold; each event, fortunate or unfortunate,being mated to some one of these strange visions by ties known only tothe soul.We crossed a court-yard surrounded by buildings necessary for the farmwork,--a barn, a wine-press, cow-sheds, and stables. Warned by thebarking of the watch-dog, a servant came to meet us, saying thatMonsieur le comte had gone to Azay in the morning but would soon return,and that Madame la comtesse was at home. My companion looked at me. Ifairly trembled lest he should decline to see Madame de Mortsauf inher husband\'s absence; but he told the man to announce us. With theeagerness of a child I rushed into the long antechamber which crossesthe whole house.""Come in, gentlemen,"" said a golden voice.Though Madame de Mortsauf had spoken only one word at the ball, Irecognized her voice, which entered my soul and filled it as a ray ofsunshine fills and gilds a prisoner\'s dungeon. Thinking, suddenly, thatshe might remember my face, my first impulse was to fly; but it was toolate,--she appeared in the doorway, and our eyes met. I know not whichof us blushed deepest. Too much confused for immediate speech shereturned to her seat at an embroidery frame while the servant placed twochairs, then she drew out her needle and counted some stitches, as ifto explain her silence; after which she raised her head, gently yetproudly, in the direction of Monsieur de Chessel as she asked to whatfortunate circumstance she owed his visit. Though curious to know thesecret of my unexpected appearance, she looked at neither of us,--hereyes were fixed on the river; and yet you could have told by the way shelistened that she was able to recognize, as the blind do, the agitationsof a neighboring soul by the imperceptible inflexions of the voice.Monsieur de Chessel gave my name and biography. I had lately arrivedat Tours, where my parents had recalled me when the armies threatenedParis. A son of Touraine to whom Touraine was as yet unknown, she wouldfind me a young man weakened by excessive study and sent to Frapesle toamuse himself; he had already shown me his estate, which I saw forthe first time. I had just told him that I had walked from Tours toFrapesle, and fearing for my health--which was really delicate--he hadstopped at Clochegourde to ask her to allow me to rest there. Monsieurde Chessel told the truth; but the accident seemed so forced that Madamede Mortsauf distrusted us. She gave me a cold, severe glance, underwhich my own eyelids fell, as much from a sense of humiliation asto hide the tears that rose beneath them. She saw the moisture on myforehead, and perhaps she guessed the tears; for she offered me therestoratives I needed, with a few kind and consoling words, which gaveme back the power of speech. I blushed like a young girl, and in a voiceas tremulous as that of an old man I thanked her and declined.""All I ask,"" I said, raising my eyes to hers, which mine now met for thesecond time in a glance as rapid as lightning,--""is to rest here. I amso crippled with fatigue I really cannot walk farther.""""You must not doubt the hospitality of our beautiful Touraine,"" shesaid; then, turning to my companion, she added: ""You will give us thepleasure of your dining at Clochegourde?""I threw such a look of entreaty at Monsieur de Chessel that he beganthe preliminaries of accepting the invitation, though it was given ina manner that seemed to expect a refusal. As a man of the world,he recognized these shades of meaning; but I, a young man withoutexperience, believed so implicitly in the sincerity between word andthought of this beautiful woman that I was wholly astonished when myhost said to me, after we reached home that evening, ""I stayed because Isaw you were dying to do so; but if you do not succeed in making itall right, I may find myself on bad terms with my neighbors."" Thatexpression, ""if you do not make it all right,"" made me ponder the matterdeeply. In other words, if I pleased Madame de Mortsauf, she wouldnot be displeased with the man who introduced me to her. He evidentlythought I had the power to please her; this in itself gave me thatpower, and corroborated my inward hope at a moment when it needed someoutward succor.""I am afraid it will be difficult,"" he began; ""Madame de Chessel expectsus.""""She has you every day,"" replied the countess; ""besides, we can send herword. Is she alone?""""No, the Abbe de Quelus is there.""""Well, then,"" she said, rising to ring the bell, ""you really must dinewith us.""This time Monsieur de Chessel thought her in earnest, and gave me acongratulatory look. As soon as I was sure of passing a whole eveningunder that roof I seemed to have eternity before me. For many miserablebeings to-morrow is a word without meaning, and I was of the number whohad no faith in it; when I was certain of a few hours of happiness Imade them contain a whole lifetime of delight.Madame de Mortsauf talked about local affairs, the harvest, the vintage,and other matters to which I was a total stranger. This usually argueseither a want of breeding or great contempt for the stranger presentwho is thus shut out from the conversation, but in this case it wasembarrassment. Though at first I thought she treated me as a child andI envied the man of thirty to whom she talked of serious matters whichI could not comprehend, I came, a few months later, to understand howsignificant a woman\'s silence often is, and how many thoughts a volubleconversation masks. At first I attempted to be at my ease and take partin it, then I perceived the advantages of my situation and gave myselfup to the charm of listening to Madame de Mortsauf\'s voice. The breathof her soul rose and fell among the syllables as sound is divided by thenotes of a flute; it died away to the ear as it quickened the pulsationof the blood. Her way of uttering the terminations in ""i"" was like abird\'s song; the ""ch"" as she said it was a kiss, but the ""t\'s"" werean echo of her heart\'s despotism. She thus extended, without herselfknowing that she did so, the meaning of her words, leading the soul ofthe listener into regions above this earth. Many a time I have continueda discussion I could easily have ended, many a time I have allowedmyself to be unjustly scolded that I might listen to those harmonies ofthe human voice, that I might breathe the air of her soul as it lefther lips, and strain to my soul that spoken light as I would fain havestrained the speaker to my breast. A swallow\'s song of joy it was whenshe was gay!--but when she spoke of her griefs, a swan\'s voice callingto its mates!Madame de Mortsauf\'s inattention to my presence enabled me to examineher. My eyes rejoiced as they glided over the sweet speaker; they kissedher feet, they clasped her waist, they played with the ringlets of herhair. And yet I was a prey to terror, as all who, once in their lives,have experienced the illimitable joys of a true passion will understand.I feared she would detect me if I let my eyes rest upon the shoulder Ihad kissed, and the fear sharpened the temptation. I yielded, I looked,my eyes tore away the covering; I saw the mole which lay where thepretty line between the shoulders started, and which, ever since theball, had sparkled in that twilight which seems the region of the sleepof youths whose imagination is ardent and whose life is chaste.I can sketch for you the leading features which all eyes saw in Madamede Mortsauf; but no drawing, however correct, no color, however warm,can represent her to you. Her face was of those that require theunattainable artist, whose hand can paint the reflection of inwardfires and render that luminous vapor which defies science and is notrevealable by language--but which a lover sees. Her soft, fair hairoften caused her much suffering, no doubt through sudden rushes of bloodto the head. Her brow, round and prominent like that of Joconda, teemedwith unuttered thoughts, restrained feelings--flowers drowning in bitterwaters. The eyes, of a green tinge flecked with brown, were always wan;but if her children were in question, or if some keen condition of joyor suffering (rare in the lives of all resigned women) seized her, thoseeyes sent forth a subtile gleam as if from fires that were consumingher,--the gleam that wrung the tears from mine when she covered me withher contempt, and which sufficed to lower the boldest eyelid. A Greciannose, designed it might be by Phidias, and united by its double arch tolips that were gracefully curved, spiritualized the face, which wasoval with a skin of the texture of a white camellia colored with softrose-tints upon the cheeks. Her plumpness did not detract from thegrace of her figure nor from the rounded outlines which made her shapebeautiful though well developed. You will understand the character ofthis perfection when I say that where the dazzling treasures whichhad so fascinated me joined the arm there was no crease or wrinkle. Nohollow disfigured the base of her head, like those which make the necksof some women resemble trunks of trees; her muscles were not harshlydefined, and everywhere the lines were rounded into curves as fugitiveto the eye as to the pencil. A soft down faintly showed upon her cheeksand on the outline of her throat, catching the light which made itsilken. Her little ears, perfect in shape, were, as she said herself,the ears of a mother and a slave. In after days, when our hearts wereone, she would say to me, ""Here comes Monsieur de Mortsauf""; and she wasright, though I, whose hearing is remarkably acute, could hear nothing.Her arms were beautiful. The curved fingers of the hand were long, andthe flesh projected at the side beyond the finger-nails, like thoseof antique statues. I should displease you, I know, if you were notyourself an exception to my rule, when I say that flat waists shouldhave the preference over round ones. The round waist is a sign ofstrength; but women thus formed are imperious, self-willed, and morevoluptuous than tender. On the other hand, women with flat waists aredevoted in soul, delicately perceptive, inclined to sadness, more trulywoman than the other class. The flat waist is supple and yielding; theround waist is inflexible and jealous.You now know how she was made. She had the foot of a well-bredwoman,--the foot that walks little, is quickly tired, and delights theeye when it peeps beneath the dress. Though she was the mother of twochildren, I have never met any woman so truly a young girl as she. Herwhole air was one of simplicity, joined to a certain bashful dreaminesswhich attracted others, just as a painter arrests our steps before afigure into which his genius has conveyed a world of sentiment. If yourecall the pure, wild fragrance of the heath we gathered on our returnfrom the Villa Diodati, the flower whose tints of black and rose youpraised so warmly, you can fancy how this woman could be elegant thoughremote from the social world, natural in expression, fastidious inall things which became part of herself,--in short, like the heath ofmingled colors. Her body had the freshness we admire in the unfoldingleaf; her spirit the clear conciseness of the aboriginal mind; she was achild by feeling, grave through suffering, the mistress of a household,yet a maiden too. Therefore she charmed artlessly and unconsciously,by her way of sitting down or rising, of throwing in a word or keepingsilence. Though habitually collected, watchful as the sentinel onwhom the safety of others depends and who looks for danger, there weremoments when smiles would wreathe her lips and betray the happy natureburied beneath the saddened bearing that was the outcome of her life.Her gift of attraction was mysterious. Instead of inspiring the gallantattentions which other women seek, she made men dream, letting them seeher virginal nature of pure flame, her celestial visions, as we see theazure heavens through rifts in the clouds. This involuntary revelationof her being made others thoughtful. The rarity of her gestures, aboveall, the rarity of her glances--for, excepting her children, she seldomlooked at any one--gave a strange solemnity to all she said and did whenher words or actions seemed to her to compromise her dignity.On this particular morning Madame de Mortsauf wore a rose-colored gownpatterned in tiny stripes, a collar with a wide hem, a black belt, andlittle boots of the same hue. Her hair was simply twisted round herhead, and held in place by a tortoise-shell comb. Such, my dear Natalie,is the imperfect sketch I promised you. But the constant emanation ofher soul upon her family, that nurturing essence shed in floods aroundher as the sun emits its light, her inward nature, her cheerfulness ondays serene, her resignation on stormy ones,--all those variations ofexpression by which character is displayed depend, like the effectsin the sky, on unexpected and fugitive circumstances, which have noconnection with each other except the background against which theyrest, though all are necessarily mingled with the events of thishistory,--truly a household epic, as great to the eyes of a wise man asa tragedy to the eyes of the crowd, an epic in which you will feel aninterest, not only for the part I took in it, but for the likeness thatit bears to the destinies of so vast a number of women.Everything at Clochegourde bore signs of a truly English cleanliness.The room in which the countess received us was panelled throughout andpainted in two shades of gray. The mantelpiece was ornamented with aclock inserted in a block of mahogany and surmounted with a tazza, andtwo large vases of white porcelain with gold lines, which held bunchesof Cape heather. A lamp was on a pier-table, and a backgammon board onlegs before the fireplace. Two wide bands of cotton held back the whitecambric curtains, which had no fringe. The furniture was covered withgray cotton bound with a green braid, and the tapestry on the countess\'sframe told why the upholstery was thus covered. Such simplicity rose tograndeur. No apartment, among all that I have seen since, has given mesuch fertile, such teeming impressions as those that filled my mindin that salon of Clochegourde, calm and composed as the life of itsmistress, where the conventual regularity of her occupations made itselffelt. The greater part of my ideas in science or politics, even theboldest of them, were born in that room, as perfumes emanate fromflowers; there grew the mysterious plant that cast upon my soul itsfructifying pollen; there glowed the solar warmth which developed mygood and shrivelled my evil qualities. Through the windows the eye tookin the valley from the heights of Pont-de-Ruan to the chateau d\'Azay,following the windings of the further shore, picturesquely varied by thetowers of Frapesle, the church, the village, and the old manor-house ofSache, whose venerable pile looked down upon the meadows.In harmony with this reposeful life, and without other excitements toemotion than those arising in the family, this scene conveyed to thesoul its own serenity. If I had met her there for the first time,between the count and her two children, instead of seeing herresplendent in a ball dress, I should not have ravished that deliriouskiss, which now filled me with remorse and with the fear of having lostthe future of my love. No; in the gloom of my unhappy life I should havebent my knee and kissed the hem of her garment, wetting it with tears,and then I might have flung myself into the Indre. But having breathedthe jasmine perfume of her skin and drunk the milk of that cup of love,my soul had acquired the knowledge and the hope of human joys; I wouldlive and await the coming of happiness as the savage awaits his hour ofvengeance; I longed to climb those trees, to creep among the vines, tofloat in the river; I wanted the companionship of night and its silence,I needed lassitude of body, I craved the heat of the sun to make theeating of the delicious apple into which I had bitten perfect. Had sheasked of me the singing flower, the riches buried by the comrades ofMorgan the destroyer, I would have sought them, to obtain those otherriches and that mute flower for which I longed.When my dream, the dream into which this first contemplation of myidol plunged me, came to an end and I heard her speaking of Monsieur deMortsauf, the thought came that a woman must belong to her husband, anda raging curiosity possessed me to see the owner of this treasure. Twoemotions filled my mind, hatred and fear,--hatred which allowed of noobstacles and measured all without shrinking, and a vague, but real fearof the struggle, of its issue, and above all of _her_.""Here is Monsieur de Mortsauf,"" she said.I sprang to my feet like a startled horse. Though the movement was seenby Monsieur de Chessel and the countess, neither made any observation,for a diversion was effected at this moment by the entrance of a littlegirl, whom I took to be about six years old, who came in exclaiming,""Here\'s papa!""""Madeleine?"" said her mother, gently.The child at once held out her hand to Monsieur de Chessel, and lookedattentively at me after making a little bow with an air of astonishment.""Are you more satisfied about her health?"" asked Monsieur de Chessel.""She is better,"" replied the countess, caressing the little head whichwas already nestling in her lap.The next question of Monsieur de Chessel let me know that Madeleinewas nine years old; I showed great surprise, and immediately the cloudsgathered on the mother\'s brow. My companion threw me a significantlook,--one of those which form the education of men of the world. I hadstumbled no doubt upon some maternal wound the covering of which shouldhave been respected. The sickly child, whose eyes were pallid andwhose skin was white as a porcelain vase with a light within it, wouldprobably not have lived in the atmosphere of a city. Country air and hermother\'s brooding care had kept the life in that frail body, delicateas a hot-house plant growing in a harsh and foreign climate. Though innothing did she remind me of her mother, Madeleine seemed to have hersoul, and that soul held her up. Her hair was scanty and black, her eyesand cheeks hollow, her arms thin, her chest narrow, showing a battlebetween life and death, a duel without truce in which the mother hadso far been victorious. The child willed to live,--perhaps to spare hermother, for at times, when not observed, she fell into the attitude ofa weeping-willow. You might have thought her a little gypsy dying ofhunger, begging her way, exhausted but always brave and dressed up toplay her part.""Where have you left Jacques?"" asked the countess, kissing the whiteline which parted the child\'s hair into two bands that looked like acrow\'s wings.""He is coming with papa.""Just then the count entered, holding his son by the hand. Jacques, theimage of his sister, showed the same signs of weakness. Seeing thesesickly children beside a mother so magnificently healthy it wasimpossible not to guess at the causes of the grief which clouded herbrow and kept her silent on a subject she could take to God only. Ashe bowed, Monsieur de Mortsauf gave me a glance that was less observingthan awkwardly uneasy,--the glance of a man whose distrust grows outof his inability to analyze. After explaining the circumstances of ourvisit, and naming me to him, the countess gave him her place and leftthe room. The children, whose eyes were on those of their mother as ifthey drew the light of theirs from hers, tried to follow her; but shesaid, with a finger on her lips, ""Stay dears!"" and they obeyed, buttheir eyes filled. Ah! to hear that one word ""dears"" what tasks theywould have undertaken!Like the children, I felt less warm when she had left us. My name seemedto change the count\'s feeling toward me. Cold and supercilious in hisfirst glance, he became at once, if not affectionate, at least politelyattentive, showing me every consideration and seeming pleased to receiveme as a guest. My father had formerly done devoted service to theBourbons, and had played an important and perilous, though secret part.When their cause was lost by the elevation of Napoleon, he tookrefuge in the quietude of the country and domestic life, accepting theunmerited accusations that followed him as the inevitable reward ofthose who risk all to win all, and who succumb after serving as pivot tothe political machine. Knowing nothing of the fortunes, nor of the past,nor of the future of my family, I was unaware of this devoted servicewhich the Comte de Mortsauf well remembered. Moreover, the antiquity ofour name, the most precious quality of a man in his eyes, added to thewarmth of his greeting. I knew nothing of these reasons until later; forthe time being the sudden transition to cordiality put me at my ease.When the two children saw that we were all three fairly engaged inconversation, Madeleine slipped her head from her father\'s hand, glancedat the open door, and glided away like an eel, Jacques followingher. They rejoined their mother, and I heard their voices and theirmovements, sounding in the distance like the murmur of bees about ahive.I watched the count, trying to guess his character, but I became sointerested in certain leading traits that I got no further thana superficial examination of his personality. Though he was onlyforty-five years old, he seemed nearer sixty, so much had the greatshipwreck at the close of the eighteenth century aged him. The crescentof hair which monastically fringed the back of his head, otherwisecompletely bald, ended at the ears in little tufts of gray mingled withblack. His face bore a vague resemblance to that of a white wolf withblood about its muzzle, for his nose was inflamed and gave signs of alife poisoned at its springs and vitiated by diseases of long standing.His flat forehead, too broad for the face beneath it, which ended in apoint, and transversely wrinkled in crooked lines, gave signs of a lifein the open air, but not of any mental activity; it also showed theburden of constant misfortunes, but not of any efforts made to surmountthem. His cheekbones, which were brown and prominent amid the generalpallor of his skin, showed a physical structure which was likely toensure him a long life. His hard, light-yellow eye fell upon mine likea ray of wintry sun, bright without warmth, anxious without thought,distrustful without conscious cause. His mouth was violent anddomineering, his chin flat and long. Thin and very tall, he had thebearing of a gentleman who relies upon the conventional value of hiscaste, who knows himself above others by right, and beneath them infact. The carelessness of country life had made him neglect his externalappearance. His dress was that of a country-man whom peasants andneighbors no longer considered except for his territorial worth. Hisbrown and wiry hands showed that he wore no gloves unless he mounted ahorse, or went to church, and his shoes were thick and common.Though ten years of emigration and ten years more of farm-life hadchanged his physical condition, he still retained certain vestiges ofnobility. The bitterest liberal (a term not then in circulation)would readily have admitted his chivalric loyalty and the imperishableconvictions of one who puts his faith to the ""Quotidienne""; he wouldhave felt respect for the man religiously devoted to a cause, honestin his political antipathies, incapable of serving his party but verycapable of injuring it, and without the slightest real knowledge of theaffairs of France. The count was in fact one of those upright men whoare available for nothing, but stand obstinately in the way of all;ready to die under arms at the post assigned to them, but preferring togive their life rather than to give their money.During dinner I detected, in the hanging of his flaccid cheeks and thecovert glances he cast now and then upon his children, the tracesof some wearing thought which showed for a moment upon the surface.Watching him, who could fail to understand him? Who would not have seenthat he had fatally transmitted to his children those weakly bodies inwhich the principle of life was lacking. But if he blamed himself hedenied to others the right to judge him. Harsh as one who knows himselfin fault, yet without greatness of soul or charm to compensate for theweight of misery he had thrown into the balance, his private life wasno doubt the scene of irascibilities that were plainly revealed in hisangular features and by the incessant restlessness of his eye. When hiswife returned, followed by the children who seemed fastened to her side,I felt the presence of unhappiness, just as in walking over the roofof a vault the feet become in some way conscious of the depths below.Seeing these four human beings together, holding them all as it were inone glance, letting my eye pass from one to the other, studying theircountenances and their respective attitudes, thoughts steeped in sadnessfell upon my heart as a fine gray rain dims a charming landscape afterthe sun has risen clear.When the immediate subject of conversation was exhausted the count toldhis wife who I was, and related certain circumstances connected with myfamily that were wholly unknown to me. He asked me my age. When I toldit, the countess echoed my own exclamation of surprise at her daughter\'sage. Perhaps she had thought me fifteen. Later on, I discovered thatthis was still another tie which bound her strongly to me. Even then Iread her soul. Her motherhood quivered with a tardy ray of hope.Seeing me at over twenty years of age so slight and delicate and yet sonervously strong, a voice cried to her, ""They too will live!"" She lookedat me searchingly, and in that moment I felt the barriers of ice meltingbetween us. She seemed to have many questions to ask, but uttered none.""If study has made you ill,"" she said, ""the air of our valley will soonrestore you.""""Modern education is fatal to children,"" remarked the count. ""We stuffthem with mathematics and ruin their health with sciences, and make themold before their time. You must stay and rest here,"" he added, turningto me. ""You are crushed by the avalanche of ideas that have rolled downupon you. What sort of future will this universal education bring uponus unless we prevent its evils by replacing public education in thehands of the religious bodies?""These words were in harmony with a speech he afterwards made at theelections when he refused his support to a man whose gifts would havedone good service to the royalist cause. ""I shall always distrust men oftalent,"" he said.Presently the count proposed that we should make the tour of thegardens.""Monsieur--"" said his wife.""Well, what, my dear?"" he said, turning to her with an arrogantharshness which showed plainly enough how absolute he chose to be in hisown home.""Monsieur de Vandenesse walked from Tours this morning and Monsieur deChessel, not aware of it, has already taken him on foot over Frapesle.""""Very imprudent of you,"" the count said, turning to me; ""but at yourage--"" and he shook his head in sign of regret.The conversation was resumed. I soon saw how intractable his royalismwas, and how much care was needed to swim safely in his waters. Theman-servant, who had now put on his livery, announced dinner. Monsieurde Chessel gave his arm to Madame de Mortsauf, and the count gailyseized mine to lead me into the dining-room, which was on theground-floor facing the salon.This room, floored with white tiles made in Touraine, and wainscoted tothe height of three feet, was hung with a varnished paper divided intowide panels by wreaths of flowers and fruit; the windows had cambriccurtains trimmed with red, the buffets were old pieces by Boullehimself, and the woodwork of the chairs, which were covered by hand-madetapestry, was carved oak. The dinner, plentifully supplied, was notluxurious; family silver without uniformity, Dresden china which wasnot then in fashion, octagonal decanters, knives with agate handles, andlacquered trays beneath the wine-bottles, were the chief features of thetable, but flowers adorned the porcelain vases and overhung the gildingof their fluted edges. I delighted in these quaint old things. I thoughtthe Reveillon paper with its flowery garlands beautiful. The sweetcontent that filled my sails hindered me from perceiving the obstacleswhich a life so uniform, so unvarying in solitude of the country placedbetween her and me. I was near her, sitting at her right hand, servingher with wine. Yes, unhoped-for joy! I touched her dress, I ate herbread. At the end of three hours my life had mingled with her life! Thatterrible kiss had bound us to each other in a secret which inspired uswith mutual shame. A glorious self-abasement took possession of me. Istudied to please the count, I fondled the dogs, I would gladly havegratified every desire of the children, I would have brought them hoopsand marbles and played horse with them; I was even provoked thatthey did not already fasten upon me as a thing of their own. Love hasintuitions like those of genius; and I dimly perceived that gloom,discontent, hostility would destroy my footing in that household.The dinner passed with inward happiness on my part. Feeling that I wasthere, under her roof, I gave no heed to her obvious coldness, nor tothe count\'s indifference masked by his politeness. Love, like life,has an adolescence during which period it suffices unto itself. I madeseveral stupid replies induced by the tumults of passion, but no oneperceived their cause, not even SHE, who knew nothing of love. The restof my visit was a dream, a dream which did not cease until by moonlighton that warm and balmy night I recrossed the Indre, watching the whitevisions that embellished meadows, shores, and hills, and listening tothe clear song, the matchless note, full of deep melancholy and utteredonly in still weather, of a tree-frog whose scientific name is unknownto me. Since that solemn evening I have never heard it without infinitedelight. A sense came to me then of the marble wall against whichmy feelings had hitherto dashed themselves. Would it be always so? Ifancied myself under some fatal spell; the unhappy events of my pastlife rose up and struggled with the purely personal pleasure I had justenjoyed. Before reaching Frapesle I turned to look at Clochegourdeand saw beneath its windows a little boat, called in Touraine a punt,fastened to an ash-tree and swaying on the water. This punt belonged toMonsieur de Mortsauf, who used it for fishing.""Well,"" said Monsieur de Chessel, when we were out of ear-shot. ""Ineedn\'t ask if you found those shoulders; I must, however, congratulateyou on the reception Monsieur de Mortsauf gave you. The devil! youstepped into his heart at once.""These words followed by those I have already quoted to you raised myspirits. I had not as yet said a word, and Monsieur de Chessel may haveattributed my silence to happiness.""How do you mean?"" I asked.""He never, to my knowledge, received any one so well.""""I will admit that I am rather surprised myself,"" I said, conscious of acertain bitterness underlying my companion\'s speech.Though I was too inexpert in social matters to understand its cause, Iwas much struck by the feeling Monsieur de Chessel betrayed. His realname was Durand, but he had had the weakness to discard the name ofa worthy father, a merchant who had made a large fortune underthe Revolution. His wife was sole heiress of the Chessels, an oldparliamentary family under Henry IV., belonging to the middle classes,as did most of the Parisian magistrates. Ambitious of higher flightsMonsieur de Chessel endeavored to smother the original Durand. He firstcalled himself Durand de Chessel, then D. de Chessel, and that made himMonsieur de Chessel. Under the Restoration he entailed an estate withthe title of count in virtue of letters-patent from Louis XVIII. Hischildren reaped the fruits of his audacity without knowing what it costhim in sarcastic comments. Parvenus are like monkeys, whose clevernessthey possess; we watch them climbing, we admire their agility, butonce at the summit we see only their absurd and contemptible parts. Thereverse side of my host\'s character was made up of pettiness with theaddition of envy. The peerage and he were on diverging lines. To have anambition and gratify it shows merely the insolence of strength, but tolive below one\'s avowed ambition is a constant source of ridiculeto petty minds. Monsieur de Chessel did not advance with thestraightforward step of a strong man. Twice elected deputy, twicedefeated; yesterday director-general, to-day nothing at all, not evenprefect, his successes and his defeats had injured his nature, and givenhim the sourness of invalided ambition. Though a brave man and a wittyone and capable of great things, envy, which is the root of existencein Touraine, the inhabitants of which employ their native genius injealousy of all things, injured him in upper social circles, where adissatisfied man, frowning at the success of others, slow at complimentsand ready at epigram, seldom succeeds. Had he sought less he mightperhaps have obtained more; but unhappily he had enough genuinesuperiority to make him wish to advance in his own way.At this particular time Monsieur de Chessel\'s ambition had a seconddawn. Royalty smiled upon him, and he was now affecting the grandmanner. Still he was, I must say, most kind to me, and he pleased me forthe very simple reason that with him I had found peace and rest for thefirst time. The interest, possibly very slight, which he showed inmy affairs, seemed to me, lonely and rejected as I was, an image ofpaternal love. His hospitable care contrasted so strongly with theneglect to which I was accustomed, that I felt a childlike gratitudeto the home where no fetters bound me and where I was welcomed and evencourted.The owners of Frapesle are so associated with the dawn of my life\'shappiness that I mingle them in all those memories I love to revive.Later, and more especially in connection with his letters-patent, I hadthe pleasure of doing my host some service. Monsieur de Chessel enjoyedhis wealth with an ostentation that gave umbrage to certain of hisneighbors. He was able to vary and renew his fine horses and elegantequipages; his wife dressed exquisitely; he received on a grand scale;his servants were more numerous than his neighbors approved; for all ofwhich he was said to be aping princes. The Frapesle estate is immense.Before such luxury as this the Comte de Mortsauf, with one familycariole,--which in Touraine is something between a coach without springsand a post-chaise,--forced by limited means to let or farm Clochegourde,was Tourangean up to the time when royal favor restored the family to adistinction possibly unlooked for. His greeting to me, the younger sonof a ruined family whose escutcheon dated back to the Crusades, wasintended to show contempt for the large fortune and to belittle thepossessions, the woods, the arable lands, the meadows, of a neighbor whowas not of noble birth. Monsieur de Chessel fully understood this. Theyalways met politely; but there was none of that daily intercourse orthat agreeable intimacy which ought to have existed between Clochegourdeand Frapesle, two estates separated only by the Indre, and whosemistresses could have beckoned to each other from their windows.Jealousy, however, was not the sole reason for the solitude in which theCount de Mortsauf lived. His early education was that of the childrenof great families,--an incomplete and superficial instruction as toknowledge, but supplemented by the training of society, the habits of acourt life, and the exercise of important duties under the crown or ineminent offices. Monsieur de Mortsauf had emigrated at the verymoment when the second stage of his education was about to begin, andaccordingly that training was lacking to him. He was one of thosewho believed in the immediate restoration of the monarchy; with thatconviction in his mind, his exile was a long and miserable period ofidleness. When the army of Conde, which his courage led him to join withthe utmost devotion, was disbanded, he expected to find some other postunder the white flag, and never sought, like other emigrants, to take upan industry. Perhaps he had not the sort of courage that could lay asidehis name and earn his living in the sweat of a toil he despised. Hishopes, daily postponed to the morrow, and possibly a scruple of honor,kept him from offering his services to foreign powers. Trials underminedhis courage. Long tramps afoot on insufficient nourishment, and aboveall, on hopes betrayed, injured his health and discouraged his mind. Bydegrees he became utterly destitute. If to some men misery is a tonic,on others it acts as a dissolvent; and the count was of the latter.Reflecting on the life of this poor Touraine gentleman, tramping andsleeping along the highroads of Hungary, sharing the mutton of PrinceEsterhazy\'s shepherds, from whom the foot-worn traveller begged the foodhe would not, as a gentleman, have accepted at the table of the master,and refusing again and again to do service to the enemies of France, Inever found it in my heart to feel bitterness against him, even when Isaw him at his worst in after days. The natural gaiety of a Frenchmanand a Tourangean soon deserted him; he became morose, fell ill, andwas charitably cared for in some German hospital. His disease was aninflammation of the mesenteric membrane, which is often fatal, andis liable, even if cured, to change the constitution and producehypochondria. His love affairs, carefully buried out of sight and whichI alone discovered, were low-lived, and not only destroyed his healthbut ruined his future.After twelve years of great misery he made his way to France, under thedecree of the Emperor which permitted the return of the emigrants. Asthe wretched wayfarer crossed the Rhine and saw the tower of Strasburgagainst the evening sky, his strength gave way. ""\'France! France!\' Icried. \'I see France!\'"" (he said to me) ""as a child cries \'Mother!\' whenit is hurt."" Born to wealth, he was now poor; made to command a regimentor govern a province, he was now without authority and without a future;constitutionally healthy and robust, he returned infirm and utterly wornout. Without enough education to take part among men and affairs, nowbroadened and enlarged by the march of events, necessarily withoutinfluence of any kind, he lived despoiled of everything, of his moralstrength as well as his physical. Want of money made his name a burden.His unalterable opinions, his antecedents with the army of Conde, histrials, his recollections, his wasted health, gave him susceptibilitieswhich are but little spared in France, that land of jest and sarcasm.Half dead he reached Maine, where, by some accident of the civil war,the revolutionary government had forgotten to sell one of his farms ofconsiderable extent, which his farmer had held for him by giving outthat he himself was the owner of it.When the Lenoncourt family, living at Givry, an estate not far fromthis farm, heard of the arrival of the Comte de Mortsauf, the Duc deLenoncourt invited him to stay at Givry while a house was being preparedfor him. The Lenoncourt family were nobly generous to him, and with themhe remained some months, struggling to hide his sufferings during thatfirst period of rest. The Lenoncourts had themselves lost an immenseproperty. By birth Monsieur de Mortsauf was a suitable husband for theirdaughter. Mademoiselle de Lenoncourt, instead of rejecting a marriagewith a feeble and worn-out man of thirty-five, seemed satisfied toaccept it. It gave her the opportunity of living with her aunt, theDuchesse de Verneuil, sister of the Prince de Blamont-Chauvry, who waslike a mother to her.Madame de Verneuil, the intimate friend of the Duchesse de Bourbon, wasa member of the devout society of which Monsieur Saint-Martin (bornin Touraine and called the Philosopher of Mystery) was the soul. Thedisciples of this philosopher practised the virtues taught them by thelofty doctrines of mystical illumination. These doctrines hold the keyto worlds divine; they explain existence by reincarnations through whichthe human spirit rises to its sublime destiny; they liberate duty fromits legal degradation, enable the soul to meet the trials of lifewith the unalterable serenity of the Quaker, ordain contempt for thesufferings of this life, and inspire a fostering care of that angelwithin us who allies us to the divine. It is stoicism with an immortalfuture. Active prayer and pure love are the elements of this faith,which is born of the Roman Church but returns to the Christianity of theprimitive faith. Mademoiselle de Lenoncourt remained, however, in theCatholic communion, to which her aunt was equally bound. Cruelly triedby revolutionary horrors, the Duchesse de Verneuil acquired in thelast years of her life a halo of passionate piety, which, to use thephraseology of Saint-Martin, shed the light of celestial love and thechrism of inward joy upon the soul of her cherished niece.After the death of her aunt, Madame de Mortsauf received several visitsat Clochegourde from Saint-Martin, a man of peace and of virtuouswisdom. It was at Clochegourde that he corrected his last books, printedat Tours by Letourmy. Madame de Verneuil, wise with the wisdom of an oldwoman who has known the stormy straits of life, gave Clochegourde tothe young wife for her married home; and with the grace of old age, soperfect where it exists, the duchess yielded everything to her niece,reserving for herself only one room above the one she had alwaysoccupied, and which she now fitted up for the countess. Her suddendeath threw a gloom over the early days of the marriage, and connectedClochegourde with ideas of sadness in the sensitive mind of thebride. The first period of her settlement in Touraine was to Madame deMortsauf, I cannot say the happiest, but the least troubled of her life.After the many trials of his exile, Monsieur de Mortsauf, taking comfortin the thought of a secure future, had a certain recovery of mind; hebreathed anew in this sweet valley the intoxicating essence of revivedhope. Compelled to husband his means, he threw himself into agriculturalpursuits and began to find some happiness in life. But the birth of hisfirst child, Jacques, was a thunderbolt which ruined both the past andthe future. The doctor declared the child had not vitality enough tolive. The count concealed this sentence from the mother; but he soughtother advice, and received the same fatal answer, the truth of whichwas confirmed at the subsequent birth of Madeleine. These events and acertain inward consciousness of the cause of this disaster increased thediseased tendencies of the man himself. His name doomed to extinction, apure and irreproachable young woman made miserable beside him and doomedto the anguish of maternity without its joys--this uprising of hisformer into his present life, with its growth of new sufferings, crushedhis spirit and completed its destruction.The countess guessed the past from the present, and read the future.Though nothing is so difficult as to make a man happy when he knowshimself to blame, she set herself to that task, which is worthy of anangel. She became stoical. Descending into an abyss, whence she stillcould see the sky, she devoted herself to the care of one man asthe sister of charity devotes herself to many. To reconcile him withhimself, she forgave him that for which he had no forgiveness. The countgrew miserly; she accepted the privations he imposed. Like all who haveknown the world only to acquire its suspiciousness, he feared betrayal;she lived in solitude and yielded without a murmur to his mistrust. Witha woman\'s tact she made him will to do that which was right, till hefancied the ideas were his own, and thus enjoyed in his own person thehonors of a superiority that was never his. After due experience ofmarried life, she came to the resolution of never leaving Clochegourde;for she saw the hysterical tendencies of the count\'s nature, and fearedthe outbreaks which might be talked of in that gossipping and jealousneighborhood to the injury of her children. Thus, thanks to her, no onesuspected Monsieur de Mortsauf\'s real incapacity, for she wrappedhis ruins in a mantle of ivy. The fickle, not merely discontented butembittered nature of the man found rest and ease in his wife; his secretanguish was lessened by the balm she shed upon it.This brief history is in part a summary of that forced from Monsieur deChessel by his inward vexation. His knowledge of the world enabledhim to penetrate several of the mysteries of Clochegourde. But theprescience of love could not be misled by the sublime attitude withwhich Madame de Mortsauf deceived the world. When alone in my littlebedroom, a sense of the full truth made me spring from my bed; Icould not bear to stay at Frapesle when I saw the lighted windows ofClochegourde. I dressed, went softly down, and left the chateau by thedoor of a tower at the foot of a winding stairway. The coolness of thenight calmed me. I crossed the Indre by the bridge at the Red Mill,took the ever-blessed punt, and rowed in front of Clochegourde, where abrilliant light was streaming from a window looking towards Azay.Again I plunged into my old meditations; but they were now peaceful,intermingled with the love-note of the nightingale and the solitary cryof the sedge-warbler. Ideas glided like fairies through my mind, liftingthe black veil which had hidden till then the glorious future. Soul andsenses were alike charmed. With what passion my thoughts rose to her!Again and again I cried, with the repetition of a madman, ""Will she bemine?"" During the preceding days the universe had enlarged to me, butnow in a single night I found its centre. On her my will and my ambitionhenceforth fastened; I desired to be all in all to her, that I mightheal and fill her lacerated heart.Beautiful was that night beneath her windows, amid the murmur of watersrippling through the sluices, broken only by a voice that told the hoursfrom the clock-tower of Sache. During those hours of darkness bathed inlight, when this sidereal flower illumined my existence, I betrothed toher my soul with the faith of the poor Castilian knight whom we laugh atin the pages of Cervantes,--a faith, nevertheless, with which all lovebegins.At the first gleam of day, the first note of the waking birds, I fledback among the trees of Frapesle and reached the house; no one had seenme, no one suspected by absence, and I slept soundly until the bell rangfor breakfast. When the meal was over I went down, in spite of the heat,to the meadow-lands for another sight of the Indre and its isles, thevalley and its slopes, of which I seemed so passionate an admirer. Butonce there, thanks to a swiftness of foot like that of a loose horse, Ireturned to my punt, the willows, and Clochegourde. All was silent andpalpitating, as a landscape is at midday in summer. The still foliagelay sharply defined on the blue of the sky; the insects that live bylight, the dragon-flies, the cantharides, were flying among the reedsand the ash-trees; cattle chewed the cud in the shade, the ruddy earthof the vineyards glowed, the adders glided up and down the banks. What achange in the sparkling and coquettish landscape while I slept! I sprangsuddenly from the boat and ran up the road which went round Clochegourdefor I fancied that I saw the count coming out. I was not mistaken; hewas walking beside the hedge, evidently making for a gate on the road toAzay which followed the bank of the river.""How are you this morning, Monsieur le comte?""He looked at me pleasantly, not being used to hear himself thusaddressed.""Quite well,"" he answered. ""You must love the country, to be ramblingabout in this heat!""""I was sent here to live in the open air.""""Then what do you say to coming with me to see them cut my rye?""""Gladly,"" I replied. ""I\'ll own to you that my ignorance is past belief;I don\'t know rye from wheat, nor a poplar from an aspen; I know nothingof farming, nor of the various methods of cultivating the soil.""""Well, come and learn,"" he cried gaily, returning upon his steps. ""Comein by the little gate above.""The count walked back along the hedge, he being within it and I without.""You will learn nothing from Monsieur de Chessel,"" he remarked; ""he isaltogether too fine a gentleman to do more than receive the reports ofhis bailiff.""The count then showed me his yards and the farm buildings, thepleasure-grounds, orchards, vineyards, and kitchen garden, until wefinally came to the long alley of acacias and ailanthus beside theriver, at the end of which I saw Madame de Mortsauf sitting on a bench,with her children. A woman is very lovely under the light and quiveringshade of such foliage. Surprised, perhaps, at my prompt visit, she didnot move, knowing very well that we should go to her. The count made meadmire the view of the valley, which at this point is totally differentfrom that seen from the heights above. Here I might have thought myselfin a corner of Switzerland. The meadows, furrowed with little brookswhich flow into the Indre, can be seen to their full extent till lost inthe misty distance. Towards Montbazon the eye ranges over a vast greenplain; in all other directions it is stopped by hills, by masses oftrees, and rocks. We quickened our steps as we approached Madame deMortsauf, who suddenly dropped the book in which Madeleine was readingto her and took Jacques upon her knees, in the paroxysms of a violentcough.""What\'s the matter?"" cried the count, turning livid.""A sore throat,"" answered the mother, who seemed not to see me; ""but itis nothing serious.""She was holding the child by the head and body, and her eyes seemed toshed two rays of life into the poor frail creature.""You are so extraordinarily imprudent,"" said the count, sharply; ""youexpose him to the river damps and let him sit on a stone bench.""""Why, papa, the stone is burning hot,"" cried Madeleine.""They were suffocating higher up,"" said the countess.""Women always want to prove they are right,"" said the count, turning tome.To avoid agreeing or disagreeing with him by word or look I watchedJacques, who complained of his throat. His mother carried him away, butas she did so she heard her husband say:--""When they have brought such sickly children into the world they oughtto learn how to take care of them.""Words that were cruelly unjust; but his self-love drove him to defendhimself at the expense of his wife. The countess hurried up the stepsand across the portico, and I saw her disappear through the glass door.Monsieur de Mortsauf seated himself on the bench, his head bowed ingloomy silence. My position became annoying; he neither spoke nor lookedat me. Farewell to the walk he had proposed, in the course of which Ihad hoped to fathom him. I hardly remember a more unpleasant moment.Ought I to go away, or should I not go? How many painful thoughts musthave arisen in his mind, to make him forget to follow Jacques and learnhow he was! At last however he rose abruptly and came towards me. Weboth turned and looked at the smiling valley.""We will put off our walk to another day, Monsieur le comte,"" I saidgently.""No, let us go,"" he replied. ""Unfortunately, I am accustomed to suchscenes--I, who would give my life without the slightest regret to savethat of the child.""""Jacques is better, my dear; he has gone to sleep,"" said a golden voice.Madame de Mortsauf suddenly appeared at the end of the path. She cameforward, without bitterness or ill-will, and bowed to me.""I am glad to see that you like Clochegourde,"" she said.""My dear, should you like me to ride over and fetch Monsieur Deslandes?""said the count, as if wishing her to forgive his injustice.""Don\'t be worried,"" she said. ""Jacques did not sleep last night, that\'sall. The child is very nervous; he had a bad dream, and I told himstories all night to keep him quiet. His cough is purely nervous; I havestilled it with a lozenge, and he has gone to sleep.""""Poor woman!"" said her husband, taking her hand in his and giving her atearful look, ""I knew nothing of it.""""Why should you be troubled when there is no occasion?"" she replied.""Now go and attend to the rye. You know if you are not there the menwill let the gleaners of the other villages get into the field beforethe sheaves are carried away.""""I am going to take a first lesson in agriculture, madame,"" I said toher.""You have a very good master,"" she replied, motioning towards the count,whose mouth screwed itself into that smile of satisfaction which isvulgarly termed a ""bouche en coeur.""Two months later I learned she had passed that night in great anxiety,fearing that her son had the croup; while I was in the boat, rocked bythoughts of love, imagined that she might see me from her window adoringthe gleam of the candle which was then lighting a forehead furrowed byfears! The croup prevailed at Tours, and was often fatal. When we wereoutside the gate, the count said in a voice of emotion, ""Madame deMortsauf is an angel!"" The words staggered me. As yet I knew but littleof the family, and the natural conscience of a young soul made meexclaim inwardly: ""What right have I to trouble this perfect peace?""Glad to find a listener in a young man over whom he could lord it soeasily, the count talked to me of the future which the return of theBourbons would secure to France. We had a desultory conversation, inwhich I listened to much childish nonsense which positively amazedme. He was ignorant of facts susceptible of proof that might be calledgeometric; he feared persons of education; he rejected superiority,and scoffed, perhaps with some reason, at progress. I discovered in hisnature a number of sensitive fibres which it required the utmost cautionnot to wound; so that a conversation with him of any length was apositive strain upon the mind. When I had, as it were, felt of hisdefects, I conformed to them with the same suppleness that his wifeshowed in soothing him. Later in life I should certainly have made himangry, but now, humble as a child, supposing that I knew nothing andbelieving that men in their prime knew all, I was genuinely amazed atthe results obtained at Clochegourde by this patient agriculturist. Ilistened admiringly to his plans; and with an involuntary flatterywhich won his good-will, I envied him the estate and its outlook--aterrestrial paradise, I called it, far superior to Frapesle.""Frapesle,"" I said, ""is a massive piece of plate, but Clochegourde is ajewel-case of gems,""--a speech which he often quoted, giving credit toits author.""Before we came here,"" he said, ""it was desolation itself.""I was all ears when he told of his seed-fields and nurseries. New tocountry life, I besieged him with questions about prices, means ofpreparing and working the soil, etc., and he seemed glad to answer allin detail.""What in the world do they teach you in your colleges?"" he exclaimed atlast in astonishment.On this first day the count said to his wife when he reached home,""Monsieur Felix is a charming young man.""That evening I wrote to my mother and asked her to send my clothes andlinen, saying that I should remain at Frapesle. Ignorant of the greatrevolution which was just taking place, and not perceiving the influenceit was to have upon my fate, I expected to return to Paris to resumemy legal studies. The Law School did not open till the first week inNovember; meantime I had two months and a half before me.The first part of my stay, while I studied to understand the count,was a period of painful impressions to me. I found him a man of extremeirascibility without adequate cause; hasty in action in hazardous casesto a degree that alarmed me. Sometimes he showed glimpses of the bravegentleman of Conde\'s army, parabolic flashes of will such as may, intimes of emergency, tear through politics like bomb-shells, and mayalso, by virtue of honesty and courage, make a man condemned to liveburied on his property an Elbee, a Bonchamp, or a Charette. In presenceof certain ideas his nostril contracted, his forehead cleared, and hiseyes shot lightnings, which were soon quenched. Sometimes I feared hemight detect the language of my eyes and kill me. I was young thenand merely tender. Will, that force that alters men so strangely,had scarcely dawned within me. My passionate desires shook me with anemotion that was like the throes of fear. Death I feared not, but Iwould not die until I knew the happiness of mutual love--But how tellof what I felt! I was a prey to perplexity; I hoped for some fortunatechance; I watched; I made the children love me; I tried to identifymyself with the family.Little by little the count restrained himself less in my presence. Icame to know his sudden outbreaks of temper, his deep and ceaselessmelancholy, his flashes of brutality, his bitter, cutting complaints,his cold hatreds, his impulses of latent madness, his childish moans,his cries of a man\'s despair, his unexpected fury. The moral naturediffers from the physical nature inasmuch as nothing is absolute in it.The force of effects is in direct proportion to the characters or theideas which are grouped around some fact. My position at Clochegourde,my future life, depended on this one eccentric will.I cannot describe to you the distress that filled my soul (as quick inthose days to expand as to contract), whenever I entered Clochegourde,and asked myself, ""How will he receive me?"" With what anxiety of heartI saw the clouds collecting on that stormy brow. I lived in a perpetual""qui-vive."" I fell under the dominion of that man; and the sufferings Iendured taught me to understand those of Madame de Mortsauf. We beganby exchanging looks of comprehension; tried by the same fire, how manydiscoveries I made during those first forty days!--of actual bitterness,of tacit joys, of hopes alternately submerged and buoyant. One evening Ifound her pensively watching a sunset which reddened the summits with soravishing a glow that it was impossible not to listen to that voice ofthe eternal Song of Songs by which Nature herself bids all her creatureslove. Did the lost illusions of her girlhood return to her? Didthe woman suffer from an inward comparison? I fancied I perceived adesolation in her attitude that was favorable to my first appeal, and Isaid, ""Some days are hard to bear.""""You read my soul,"" she answered; ""but how have you done so?""""We touch at many points,"" I replied. ""Surely we belong to the smallnumber of human beings born to the highest joys and the deepest sorrows;whose feeling qualities vibrate in unison and echo each other inwardly;whose sensitive natures are in harmony with the principle of things.Put such beings among surroundings where all is discord and they sufferhorribly, just as their happiness mounts to exaltation when they meetideas, or feelings, or other beings who are congenial to them. Butthere is still a third condition, where sorrows are known only to soulsaffected by the same distress; in this alone is the highest fraternalcomprehension. It may happen that such souls find no outlet eitherfor good or evil. Then the organ within us endowed with expression andmotion is exercised in a void, expends its passion without anobject, utters sounds without melody, and cries that are lost insolitude,--terrible defeat of a soul which revolts against the inutilityof nothingness. These are struggles in which our strength oozes awaywithout restraint, as blood from an inward wound. The sensibilitiesflow to waste and the result is a horrible weakening of the soul; anindescribable melancholy for which the confessional itself has no ears.Have I not expressed our mutual sufferings?""She shuddered, and then without removing her eyes from the setting sun,she said, ""How is it that, young as you are, you know these things? Wereyou once a woman?""""Ah!"" I replied, ""my childhood was like a long illness--""""I hear Madeleine coughing,"" she cried, leaving me abruptly.The countess showed no displeasure at my constant visits, and for tworeasons. In the first place she was pure as a child, and her thoughtswandered into no forbidden regions; in the next I amused the count andmade a sop for that lion without claws or mane. I found an excuse formy visits which seemed plausible to every one. Monsieur de Mortsaufproposed to teach me backgammon, and I accepted; as I did so thecountess was betrayed into a look of compassion, which seemed to say,""You are flinging yourself into the jaws of the lion."" If I did notunderstand this at the time, three days had not passed before I knewwhat I had undertaken. My patience, which nothing exhausts, the fruitof my miserable childhood, ripened under this last trial. The countwas delighted when he could jeer at me for not putting in practice theprinciples or the rules he had explained; if I reflected before I playedhe complained of my slowness; if I played fast he was angry becauseI hurried him; if I forgot to mark my points he declared, making hisprofit out of the mistake, that I was always too rapid. It was likethe tyranny of a schoolmaster, the despotism of the rod, of which I canreally give you no idea unless I compare myself to Epictetus under theyoke of a malicious child. When we played for money his winnings gavehim the meanest and most abject delight.A word from his wife was enough to console me, and it frequentlyrecalled him to a sense of politeness and good-breeding. But beforelong I fell into the furnace of an unexpected misery. My money wasdisappearing under these losses. Though the count was always presentduring my visits until I left the house, which was sometimes very late,I cherished the hope of finding some moment when I might say a wordthat would reach my idol\'s heart; but to obtain that moment, for whichI watched and waited with a hunter\'s painful patience, I was forced tocontinue these weary games, during which my feelings were lacerated andmy money lost. Still, there were moments when we were silent, she andI, looking at the sunlight on the meadows, the clouds in a gray sky, themisty hills, or the quivering of the moon on the sandbanks of the river;saying only, ""Night is beautiful!""""Night is woman, madame.""""What tranquillity!""""Yes, no one can be absolutely wretched here.""Then she would return to her embroidery frame. I came at last to hearthe inward beatings of an affection which sought its object. But thefact remained--without money, farewell to these evenings. I wrote to mymother to send me some. She scolded me and sent only enough to last aweek. Where could I get more? My life depended on it. Thus it happenedthat in the dawn of my first great happiness I found the same sufferingsthat assailed me elsewhere; but in Paris, at college, at school I evadedthem by abstinence; there my privations were negative, at Frapesle theywere active; so active that I was possessed by the impulse to theft, byvisions of crime, furious desperations which rend the soul and mustbe subdued under pain of losing our self-respect. The memory of whatI suffered through my mother\'s parsimony taught me that indulgencefor young men which one who has stood upon the brink of the abyss andmeasured its depths, without falling into them, must inevitably feel.Though my own rectitude was strengthened by those moments when lifeopened and let me see the rocks and quicksands beneath the surface, Ihave never known that terrible thing called human justice draw its bladethrough the throat of a criminal without saying to myself: ""Penal lawsare made by men who have never known misery.""At this crisis I happened to find a treatise on backgammon in Monsieurde Chessel\'s library, and I studied it. My host was kind enough to giveme a few lessons; less harshly taught by the count I made good progressand applied the rules and calculations I knew by heart. Within a fewdays I was able to beat Monsieur de Mortsauf; but no sooner had Idone so and won his money for the first time than his temper becameintolerable; his eyes glittered like those of tigers, his faceshrivelled, his brows knit as I never saw brows knit before or since.His complainings were those of a fretful child. Sometimes he flungdown the dice, quivered with rage, bit the dice-box, and said insultingthings to me. Such violence, however, came to an end. When I hadacquired enough mastery of the game I played it to suit me; I so managedthat we were nearly equal up to the last moment; I allowed him to winthe first half and made matters even during the last half. The end ofthe world would have surprised him less than the rapid superiority ofhis pupil; but he never admitted it. The unvarying result of our gameswas a topic of discourse on which he fastened.""My poor head,"" he would say, ""is fatigued; you manage to win the lastof the game because by that time I lose my skill.""The countess, who knew backgammon, understood my manoeuvres from thefirst, and gave me those mute thanks which swell the heart of a youngman; she granted me the same look she gave to her children. From thatever-blessed evening she always looked at me when she spoke. I cannotexplain to you the condition I was in when I left her. My soul hadannihilated my body; it weighed nothing; I did not walk, I flew. Thatlook I carried within me; it bathed me with light just as her lastwords, ""Adieu, monsieur,"" still sounded in my soul with the harmonies of""O filii, o filioe"" in the paschal choir. I was born into a new life,I was something to her! I slept on purple and fine linen. Flames dartedbefore my closed eyelids, chasing each other in the darkness likethreads of fire in the ashes of burned paper. In my dreams her voicebecame, though I cannot describe it, palpable, an atmosphere of lightand fragrance wrapping me, a melody enfolding my spirit. On the morrowher greeting expressed the fulness of feelings that remained unuttered,and from that moment I was initiated into the secrets of her voice.That day was to be one of the most decisive of my life. After dinner wewalked on the heights across a barren plain where no herbage grew;the ground was stony, arid, and without vegetable soil of any kind;nevertheless a few scrub oaks and thorny bushes straggled there, and inplace of grass, a carpet of crimped mosses, illuminated by the settingsun and so dry that our feet slipped upon it. I held Madeleine by thehand to keep her up. Madame de Mortsauf was leading Jacques. The count,who was in front, suddenly turned round and striking the earth with hiscane said to me in a dreadful tone: ""Such is my life!--but before I knewyou,"" he added with a look of penitence at his wife. The reparationwas tardy, for the countess had turned pale; what woman would not havestaggered as she did under the blow?""But what delightful scenes are wafted here, and what a view of thesunset!"" I cried. ""For my part I should like to own this barren moor; Ifancy there may be treasures if we dig for them. But its greatest wealthis that of being near you. Who would not pay a great cost for such aview?--all harmony to the eye, with that winding river where the soulmay bathe among the ash-trees and the alders. See the differenceof taste! To you this spot of earth is a barren waste; to me, it isparadise.""She thanked me with a look.""Bucolics!"" exclaimed the count, with a bitter look. ""This is no lifefor a man who bears your name."" Then he suddenly changed his tone--""Thebells!"" he cried, ""don\'t you hear the bells of Azay? I hear themringing.""Madame de Mortsauf gave me a frightened look. Madeleine clung to myhand.""Suppose we play a game of backgammon?"" I said. ""Let us go back; therattle of the dice will drown the sound of the bells.""We returned to Clochegourde, conversing by fits and starts. Once in thesalon an indefinable uncertainty and dread took possession of us. Thecount flung himself into an armchair, absorbed in reverie, which hiswife, who knew the symptoms of his malady and could foresee an outbreak,was careful not to interrupt. I also kept silence. As she gave me nohint to leave, perhaps she thought backgammon might divert the count\'smind and quiet those fatal nervous susceptibilities, the excitements ofwhich were killing him. Nothing was ever harder than to make him playthat game, which, however, he had a great desire to play. Like a prettywoman, he always required to be coaxed, entreated, forced, so that hemight not seem the obliged person. If by chance, being interested in theconversation, I forgot to propose it, he grew sulky, bitter, insulting,and spoiled the talk by contradicting everything. If, warned by hisill-humor, I suggested a game, he would dally and demur. ""In the firstplace, it is too late,"" he would say; ""besides, I don\'t care for it.""Then followed a series of affectations like those of women, which oftenleave you in ignorance of their real wishes.On this occasion I pretended a wild gaiety to induce him to play. Hecomplained of giddiness which hindered him from calculating; his brain,he said, was squeezed into a vice; he heard noises, he was choking; andthereupon he sighed heavily. At last, however, he consented to thegame. Madame de Mortsauf left us to put the children to bed and lead thehousehold in family prayers. All went well during her absence; I allowedMonsieur de Mortsauf to win, and his delight seemed to put him besidehimself. This sudden change from a gloom that led him to make thedarkest predictions to the wild joy of a drunken man, expressed in acrazy laugh and without any adequate motive, distressed and alarmed me.I had never seen him in quite so marked a paroxysm. Our intimacy hadborne fruits in the fact that he no longer restrained himself before me.Day by day he had endeavored to bring me under his tyranny, and obtainfresh food, as it were, for his evil temper; for it really seems asthough moral diseases were creatures with appetites and instincts,seeking to enlarge the boundaries of their empire as a landowner seeksto increase his domain.Presently the countess came down, and sat close to the backgammon table,apparently for better light on her embroidery, though the anxiety whichled her to place her frame was ill-concealed. A piece of fatal ill-luckwhich I could not prevent changed the count\'s face; from gaiety itfell to gloom, from purple it became yellow, and his eyes rolled.Then followed worse ill-luck, which I could neither avert nor repair.Monsieur de Mortsauf made a fatal throw which decided the game.Instantly he sprang up, flung the table at me and the lamp on the floor,struck the chimney-piece with his fist and jumped, for I cannot sayhe walked, about the room. The torrent of insults, imprecations, andincoherent words which rushed from his lips would have made an observerthink of the old tales of satanic possession in the Middle Ages. Imaginemy position!""Go into the garden,"" said the countess, pressing my hand.I left the room before the count could notice my disappearance. On theterrace, where I slowly walked about, I heard his shouts and then hismoans from the bedroom which adjoined the dining-room. Also I heard atintervals through that tempest of sound the voice of an angel, whichrose like the song of a nightingale as the rain ceases. I walked aboutunder the acacias in the loveliest night of the month of August, waitingfor the countess to join me. I knew she would come; her gesture promisedit. For several days an explanation seemed to float between us; a wordwould suffice to send it gushing from the spring, overfull, in oursouls. What timidity had thus far delayed a perfect understandingbetween us? Perhaps she loved, as I did, these quiverings of the spiritwhich resembled emotions of fear and numbed the sensibilities while weheld our life unuttered within us, hesitating to unveil its secretswith the modesty of the young girl before the husband she loves. Anhour passed. I was sitting on the brick balustrade when the sound ofher footsteps blending with the undulating ripple of her flowing gownstirred the calm air of the night. These are sensations to which theheart suffices not.""Monsieur de Mortsauf is sleeping,"" she said. ""When he is thus I givehim an infusion of poppies, a cup of water in which a few poppies havebeen steeped; the attacks are so infrequent that this simple remedynever loses its effect--Monsieur,"" she continued, changing her tone andusing the most persuasive inflexion of her voice, ""this most unfortunateaccident has revealed to you a secret which has hitherto been sedulouslykept; promise me to bury the recollection of that scene. Do this for mysake, I beg of you. I don\'t ask you to swear it; give me your word ofhonor and I shall be content.""""Need I give it to you?"" I said. ""Do we not understand each other?""""You must not judge unfavorably of Monsieur de Mortsauf; you see theeffects of his many sufferings under the emigration,"" she went on.""To-morrow he will entirely forget all that he has said and done; youwill find him kind and excellent as ever.""""Do not seek to excuse him, madame,"" I replied. ""I will do all you wish.I would fling myself into the Indre at this moment if I could restoreMonsieur de Mortsauf\'s health and ensure you a happy life. The onlything I cannot change is my opinion. I can give you my life, but notmy convictions; I can pay no heed to what he says, but can I hinder himfrom saying it? No, in my opinion Monsieur de Mortsauf is--""""I understand you,"" she said, hastily interrupting me; ""you are right.The count is as nervous as a fashionable woman,"" she added, as if toconceal the idea of madness by softening the word. ""But he is only soat intervals, once a year, when the weather is very hot. Ah, what evilshave resulted from the emigration! How many fine lives ruined! He wouldhave been, I am sure of it, a great soldier, an honor to his country--""""I know,"" I said, interrupting in my turn to let her see that it wasuseless to attempt to deceive me.She stopped, laid one hand lightly on my brow, and looked at me. ""Whohas sent you here,"" she said, ""into this home? Has God sent me help, atrue friendship to support me?"" She paused, then added, as she laid herhand firmly upon mine, ""For you are good and generous--"" She raised hereyes to heaven, as if to invoke some invisible testimony to confirm herthought, and then let them rest upon me. Electrified by the look, whichcast a soul into my soul, I was guilty, judging by social laws, of awant of tact, though in certain natures such indelicacy really means abrave desire to meet danger, to avert a blow, to arrest an evil beforeit happens; oftener still, an abrupt call upon a heart, a blow given tolearn if it resounds in unison with ours. Many thoughts rose like gleamswithin my mind and bade me wash out the stain that blotted my conscienceat this moment when I was seeking a complete understanding.""Before we say more,"" I said in a voice shaken by the throbbings ofmy heart, which could be heard in the deep silence that surrounded us,""suffer me to purify one memory of the past.""""Hush!"" she said quickly, touching my lips with a finger which sheinstantly removed. She looked at me haughtily, with the glance of awoman who knows herself too exalted for insult to reach her. ""Be silent;I know of what you are about to speak,--the first, the last, the onlyoutrage ever offered to me. Never speak to me of that ball. If as aChristian I have forgiven you, as a woman I still suffer from your act.""""You are more pitiless than God himself,"" I said, forcing back the tearsthat came into my eyes.""I ought to be so, I am more feeble,"" she replied.""But,"" I continued with the persistence of a child, ""listen to me now ifonly for the first, the last, the only time in your life.""""Speak, then,"" she said; ""speak, or you will think I dare not hear you.""Feeling that this was the turning moment of our lives, I spoke to her inthe tone that commands attention; I told her that all women whom I hadever seen were nothing to me; but when I met her, I, whose life wasstudious, whose nature was not bold, I had been, as it were, possessedby a frenzy that no one who once felt it could condemn; that never heartof man had been so filled with the passion which no being can resist,which conquers all things, even death--""And contempt?"" she asked, stopping me.""Did you despise me?"" I exclaimed.""Let us say no more on this subject,"" she replied.""No, let me say all!"" I replied, in the excitement of my intolerablepain. ""It concerns my life, my whole being, my inward self; it containsa secret you must know or I must die in despair. It also concerns you,who, unawares, are the lady in whose hand is the crown promised to thevictor in the tournament!""Then I related to her my childhood and youth, not as I have told it toyou, judged from a distance, but in the language of a young man whosewounds are still bleeding. My voice was like the axe of a woodsmanin the forest. At every word the dead years fell with echoing sound,bristling with their anguish like branches robbed of their foliage. Idescribed to her in feverish language many cruel details which I havehere spared you. I spread before her the treasure of my radiant hopes,the virgin gold of my desires, the whole of a burning heart kept alivebeneath the snow of these Alps, piled higher and higher by perpetualwinter. When, bowed down by the weight of these remembered sufferings,related as with the live coal of Isaiah, I awaited the reply of thewoman who listened with a bowed head, she illumined the darkness witha look, she quickened the worlds terrestrial and divine with a singlesentence.""We have had the same childhood!"" she said, turning to me a face onwhich the halo of the martyrs shone.After a pause, in which our souls were wedded in the one consolingthought, ""I am not alone in suffering,"" the countess told me, in thevoice she kept for her little ones, how unwelcome she was as a girl whensons were wanted. She showed me how her troubles as a daughter bound toher mother\'s side differed from those of a boy cast out upon the worldof school and college life. My desolate neglect seemed to me a paradisecompared to that contact with a millstone under which her soul wasground until the day when her good aunt, her true mother, had saved herfrom this misery, the ever-recurring pain of which she now relatedto me; misery caused sometimes by incessant faultfinding, alwaysintolerable to high-strung natures which do not shrink before deathitself but die beneath the sword of Damocles; sometimes by the crushingof generous impulses beneath an icy hand, by the cold rebuffal of herkisses, by a stern command of silence, first imposed and then as oftenblamed; by inward tears that dared not flow but stayed within the heart;in short, by all the bitterness and tyranny of convent rule, hiddento the eyes of the world under the appearance of an exalted motherlydevotion. She gratified her mother\'s vanity before strangers, butshe dearly paid in private for this homage. When, believing that byobedience and gentleness she had softened her mother\'s heart, she openedhers, the tyrant only armed herself with the girl\'s confidence. No spywas ever more traitorous and base. All the pleasures of girlhood, evenher fete days, were dearly purchased, for she was scolded for her gaietyas much as for her faults. No teaching and no training for her positionhad been given in love, always with sarcastic irony. She was not angryagainst her mother; in fact she blamed herself for feeling more terrorthan love for her. ""Perhaps,"" she said, dear angel, ""these severitieswere needful; they had certainly prepared her for her present life."" AsI listened it seemed to me that the harp of Job, from which I had drawnsuch savage sounds, now touched by the Christian fingers gave forth thelitanies of the Virgin at the foot of the cross.""We lived in the same sphere before we met in this,"" I said; ""you comingfrom the east, I from the west.""She shook her head with a gesture of despair.""To you the east, to me the west,"" she replied. ""You will live happy, Imust die of pain. Life is what we make of it, and mine is made forever.No power can break the heavy chain to which a woman is fastened by thisring of gold--the emblem of a wife\'s purity.""We knew we were twins of one womb; she never dreamed of ahalf-confidence between brothers of the same blood. After a short sigh,natural to pure hearts when they first open to each other, she told meof her first married life, her deceptions and disillusions, the rebirthof her childhood\'s misery. Like me, she had suffered under trifles;mighty to souls whose limpid substance quivers to the least shock, asa lake quivers on the surface and to its utmost depths when a stone isflung into it. When she married she possessed some girlish savings; alittle gold, the fruit of happy hours and repressed fancies. These, ina moment when they were needed, she gave to her husband, not telling himthey were gifts and savings of her own. He took no account of them, andnever regarded himself her debtor. She did not even obtain the glanceof thanks that would have paid for all. Ah! how she went from trial totrial! Monsieur de Mortsauf habitually neglected to give her money forthe household. When, after a struggle with her timidity, she asked himfor it, he seemed surprised and never once spared her the mortificationof petitioning for necessities. What terror filled her mind when thereal nature of the ruined man\'s disease was revealed to her, andshe quailed under the first outbreak of his mad anger! What bitterreflections she had made before she brought herself to admit that herhusband was a wreck! What horrible calamities had come of her bearingchildren! What anguish she felt at the sight of those infants bornalmost dead! With what courage had she said in her heart: ""I willbreathe the breath of life into them; I will bear them anew day by day!""Then conceive the bitterness of finding her greatest obstacle in theheart and hand from which a wife should draw her greatest succor! Shesaw the untold disaster that threatened him. As each difficulty wasconquered, new deserts opened before her, until the day when shethoroughly understood her husband\'s condition, the constitution of herchildren, and the character of the neighborhood in which she lived;a day when (like the child taken by Napoleon from a tender home) shetaught her feet to trample through mud and snow, she trained her nervesto bullets and all her being to the passive obedience of a soldier.These things, of which I here make a summary, she told me in all theirdark extent, with every piteous detail of conjugal battles lost andfruitless struggles.""You would have to live here many months,"" she said, in conclusion, ""tounderstand what difficulties I have met with in improving Clochegourde;what persuasions I have had to use to make him do a thing which was mostimportant to his interests. You cannot imagine the childish glee he hasshown when anything that I advised was not at once successful. All thatturned out well he claimed for himself. Yes, I need an infinite patienceto bear his complaints when I am half-exhausted in the effort to amusehis weary hours, to sweeten his life and smooth the paths which hehimself has strewn with stones. The reward he gives me is that awfulcry: \'Let me die, life is a burden to me!\' When visitors are here and heenjoys them, he forgets his gloom and is courteous and polite. You askme why he cannot be so to his family. I cannot explain that want ofloyalty in a man who is truly chivalrous. He is quite capable of ridingat full speed to Paris to buy me a set of ornaments, as he did the otherday before the ball. Miserly in his household, he would be lavish uponme if I wished it. I would it were reversed; I need nothing for myself,but the wants of the household are many. In my strong desire to make himhappy, and not reflecting that I might be a mother, I began my marriedlife by letting him treat me as a victim, I, who at that time by using afew caresses could have led him like a child--but I was unable to play apart I should have thought disgraceful. Now, however, the welfare of myfamily requires me to be as calm and stern as the figure of Justice--andyet, I too have a heart that overflows with tenderness.""""But why,"" I said, ""do you not use this great influence to master himand govern him?""""If it concerned myself only I should not attempt either to overcome thedogged silence with which for days together he meets my arguments,nor to answer his irrational remarks, his childish reasons. I have nocourage against weakness, any more than I have against childhood;they may strike me as they will, I cannot resist. Perhaps I might meetstrength with strength, but I am powerless against those I pity. If Iwere required to coerce Madeleine in some matter that would save herlife, I should die with her. Pity relaxes all my fibres and unstringsmy nerves. So it is that the violent shocks of the last ten years havebroken me down; my feelings, so often battered, are numb at times;nothing can revive them; even the courage with which I once faced mytroubles begins to fail me. Yes, sometimes I am beaten. For want ofrest--I mean repose--and sea-baths by which to recover my nervousstrength, I shall perish. Monsieur de Mortsauf will have killed me, andhe will die of my death.""""Why not leave Clochegourde for a few months? Surely you could take yourchildren and go to the seashore.""""In the first place, Monsieur de Mortsauf would think he were lost if Ileft him. Though he will not admit his condition he is well aware of it.He is both sane and mad, two natures in one man, a contradiction whichexplains many an irrational action. Besides this, he would have goodreason for objecting. Nothing would go right here if I were absent. Youmay have seen in me the mother of a family watchful to protect her youngfrom the hawk that is hovering over them; a weighty task, indeed, butharder still are the cares imposed upon me by Monsieur de Mortsauf,whose constant cry, as he follows me about is, \'Where is Madame?\' Iam Jacques\' tutor and Madeleine\'s governess; but that is not all, I ambailiff and steward too. You will understand what that means when youcome to see, as you will, that the working of an estate in these partsis the most fatiguing of all employments. We get small returns in money;the farms are cultivated on shares, a system which needs the closestsupervision. We are obliged ourselves to sell our own produce, ourcattle and harvests of all kinds. Our competitors in the markets are ourown farmers, who meet consumers in the wine-shops and determineprices by selling first. I should weary you if I explained the manydifficulties of agriculture in this region. No matter what care I giveto it, I cannot always prevent our tenants from putting our manure upontheir ground, I cannot be ever on the watch lest they take advantageof us in the division of the crops; neither can I always know theexact moment when sales should be made. So, if you think of Monsieur deMortsauf\'s defective memory, and the difficulty you have seen me have inpersuading him to attend to business, you can understand the burden thatis on my shoulders, and the impossibility of my laying it down for asingle day. If I were absent we should be ruined. No one would obeyMonsieur de Mortsauf. In the first place his orders are conflicting;then no one likes him; he finds incessant fault, and he is verydomineering. Moreover, like all men of feeble mind, he listens tooreadily to his inferiors. If I left the house not a servant would be init in a week\'s time. So you see I am attached to Clochegourde as thoseleaden finals are to our roof. I have no reserves with you. The wholecountry-side is still ignorant of the secrets of this house, butyou know them, you have seen them. Say nothing but what is kind andfriendly, and you shall have my esteem--my gratitude,"" she added in asofter voice. ""On those terms you are welcome at Clochegourde, where youwill find friends.""""Ah!"" I exclaimed, ""I see that I have never really suffered, whileyou--""""No, no!"" she exclaimed, with a smile, that smile of all resigned womenwhich might melt a granite rock. ""Do not be astonished at my frankconfidence; it shows you life as it is, not as your imagination picturesit. We all have our defects and our good qualities. If I had married aspendthrift he would have ruined me. If I had given myself to an ardentand pleasure-loving young man, perhaps I could not have retained him;he might have left me, and I should have died of jealousy. For Iam jealous!"" she said, in a tone of excitement, which was like thethunderclap of a passing storm. ""But Monsieur de Mortsauf loves meas much as he is capable of loving; all that his heart contains ofaffection he pours at my feet, like the Magdalen\'s cup of ointment.Believe me, a life of love is an exception to the laws of this earth;all flowers fade; great joys and emotions have a morrow of evil--ifa morrow at all. Real life is a life of anguish; its image is in thatnettle growing there at the foot of the wall,--no sun can reach it andit keeps green. Yet, here, as in parts of the North, there are smiles inthe sky, few to be sure, but they compensate for many a grief.Moreover, women who are naturally mothers live and love far more throughsacrifices than through pleasures. Here I draw upon myself the storms Ifear may break upon my children or my people; and in doing so I feela something I cannot explain, which gives me secret courage. Theresignation of the night carries me through the day that follows.God does not leave me comfortless. Time was when the condition of mychildren filled me with despair; to-day as they advance in life theygrow healthier and stronger. And then, after all, our home is improvedand beautified, our means are improving also. Who knows but Monsieur deMortsauf\'s old age may be a blessing to me? Ah, believe me! thosewho stand before the Great Judge with palms in their hands, leadingcomforted to Him the beings who cursed their lives, they, they haveturned their sorrows into joy. If my sufferings bring about thehappiness of my family, are they sufferings at all?""""Yes,"" I said, ""they are; but they were necessary, as mine have been, tomake us understand the true flavor of the fruit that has ripened on ourrocks. Now, surely, we shall taste it together; surely we may admire itswonders, the sweetness of affection it has poured into our souls,that inward sap which revives the searing leaves--Good God! do you notunderstand me?"" I cried, falling into the mystical language to which ourreligious training had accustomed us. ""See the paths by which wehave approached each other; what magnet led us through that ocean ofbitterness to these springs of running water, flowing at the foot ofthose hills above the shining sands and between their green and flowerymeadows? Have we not followed the same star? We stand before the cradleof a divine child whose joyous carol will renew the world for us, teachus through happiness a love of life, give to our nights their long-lostsleep, and to the days their gladness. What hand is this that year byyear has tied new cords between us? Are we not more than brother andsister? That which heaven has joined we must not keep asunder. Thesufferings you reveal are the seeds scattered by the sower for theharvest already ripening in the sunshine. Shall we not gather it sheafby sheaf? What strength is in me that I dare address you thus! Answer,or I will never again recross that river!""""You have spared me the word _love_,"" she said, in a stern voice, ""butyou have spoken of a sentiment of which I know nothing and which is notpermitted to me. You are a child; and again I pardon you, but for thelast time. Endeavor to understand, Monsieur, that my heart is, as itwere, intoxicated with motherhood. I love Monsieur de Mortsauf neitherfrom social duty nor from a calculated desire to win eternal blessings,but from an irresistible feeling which fastens all the fibres of myheart upon him. Was my marriage a mistake? My sympathy for misfortuneled to it. It is the part of women to heal the woes caused by the marchof events, to comfort those who rush into the breach and return wounded.How shall I make you understand me? I have felt a selfish pleasure inseeing that you amused him; is not that pure motherhood? Did I not makeyou see by what I owned just now, the _three_ children to whom I ambound, to whom I shall never fail, on whom I strive to shed a healingdew and the light of my own soul without withdrawing or adulterating asingle particle? Do not embitter the mother\'s milk! though as a wife Iam invulnerable, you must never again speak thus to me. If you do notrespect this command, simple as it is, the door of this house willbe closed to you. I believed in pure friendship, in a voluntarybrotherhood, more real, I thought, than the brotherhood of blood. Iwas mistaken. I wanted a friend who was not a judge, a friend who wouldlisten to me in those moments of weakness when reproof is killing, asacred friend from whom I should have nothing to fear. Youth is noble,truthful, capable of sacrifice, disinterested; seeing your persistencyin coming to us, I believed, yes, I will admit that I believed in somedivine purpose; I thought I should find a soul that would be mine, asthe priest is the soul of all; a heart in which to pour my troubleswhen they deluged mine, a friend to hear my cries when if I continuedto smother them they would strangle me. Could I but have this friend,my life, so precious to these children, might be prolonged until Jacqueshad grown to manhood. But that is selfish! The Laura of Petrarch cannotbe lived again. I must die at my post, like a soldier, friendless. Myconfessor is harsh, austere, and--my aunt is dead.""Two large tears filled her eyes, gleamed in the moonlight, and rolleddown her cheeks; but I stretched my hand in time to catch them, and Idrank them with an avidity excited by her words, by the thought ofthose ten years of secret woe, of wasted feelings, of constant care, ofceaseless dread--years of the lofty heroism of her sex. She looked at mewith gentle stupefaction.""It is the first communion of love,"" I said. ""Yes, I am now a sharer ofyour sorrows. I am united to your soul as our souls are united to Christin the sacrament. To love, even without hope, is happiness. Ah! whatwoman on earth could give me a joy equal to that of receiving yourtears! I accept the contract which must end in suffering to myself. Igive myself to you with no ulterior thought. I will be to you that whichyou will me to be--""She stopped me with a motion of her hand, and said in her deep voice, ""Iconsent to this agreement if you will promise never to tighten the bondswhich bind us together.""""Yes,"" I said; ""but the less you grant the more evidence of possession Iought to have.""""You begin by distrusting me,"" she replied, with an expression ofmelancholy doubt.""No, I speak from pure happiness. Listen; give me a name by which no onecalls you; a name to be ours only, like the feeling which unites us.""""That is much to ask,"" she said, ""but I will show you that I am notpetty. Monsieur de Mortsauf calls me Blanche. One only person, the one Ihave most loved, my dear aunt, called me Henriette. I will be Henrietteonce more, to you.""I took her hand and kissed it. She left it in mine with the trustfulnessthat makes a woman so far superior to men; a trustfulness that shamesus. She was leaning on the brick balustrade and gazing at the river.""Are you not unwise, my friend, to rush at a bound to the extremes offriendship? You have drained the cup, offered in all sincerity, at adraught. It is true that a real feeling is never piecemeal; it must bewhole, or it does not exist. Monsieur de Mortsauf,"" she added after ashort silence, ""is above all things loyal and brave. Perhaps for mysake you will forget what he said to you to-day; if he has forgottenit to-morrow, I will myself tell him what occurred. Do not come toClochegourde for a few days; he will respect you more if you do not.On Sunday, after church, he will go to you. I know him; he will wish toundo the wrong he did, and he will like you all the better for treatinghim as a man who is responsible for his words and actions.""""Five days without seeing you, without hearing your voice!""""Do not put such warmth into your manner of speaking to me,"" she said.We walked twice round the terrace in silence. Then she said, in a toneof command which proved to me that she had taken possession of my soul,""It is late; we will part.""I wished to kiss her hand; she hesitated, then gave it to me, and saidin a voice of entreaty: ""Never take it unless I give it to you; leave memy freedom; if not, I shall be simply a thing of yours, and that oughtnot to be.""""Adieu,"" I said.I went out by the little gate of the lower terrace, which she opened forme. Just as she was about to close it she opened it again and offered meher hand, saying: ""You have been truly good to me this evening; you havecomforted my whole future; take it, my friend, take it.""I kissed her hand again and again, and when I raised my eyes I saw thetears in hers. She returned to the upper terrace and I watched her fora moment from the meadow. When I was on the road to Frapesle I again sawher white robe shimmering in a moonbeam; then, a few moments later, alight was in her bedroom.""Oh, my Henriette!"" I cried, ""to you I pledge the purest love that evershone upon this earth.""I turned at every step as I regained Frapesle. Ineffable contentmentfilled my mind. A way was open for the devotion that swells in allyouthful hearts and which in mine had been so long inert. Like thepriest who by one solemn step enters a new life, my vows were taken; Iwas consecrated. A simple ""Yes"" had bound me to keep my love within mysoul and never to abuse our friendship by leading this woman step bystep to love. All noble feelings were awakened within me, and I heardthe murmur of their voices. Before confining myself within the narrowwalls of a room, I stopped beneath the azure heavens sown with stars,I listened to the ring-dove plaints of my own heart, I heard again thesimple tones of that ingenuous confidence, I gathered in the air theemanations of that soul which henceforth must ever seek me. How grandthat woman seemed to me, with her absolute forgetfulness of self, herreligion of mercy to wounded hearts, feeble or suffering, her declaredallegiance to her legal yoke. She was there, serene upon her pyre ofsaint and martyr. I adored her face as it shone to me in the darkness.Suddenly I fancied I perceived a meaning in her words, a mysterioussignificance which made her to my eyes sublime. Perhaps she longed thatI should be to her what she was to the little world around her. Perhapsshe sought to draw from me her strength and consolation, putting me thuswithin her sphere, her equal, or perhaps above her. The stars, saysome bold builders of the universe, communicate to each other light andmotion. This thought lifted me to ethereal regions. I entered once morethe heaven of my former visions; I found a meaning for the miseries ofmy childhood in the illimitable happiness to which they had led me.Spirits quenched by tears, hearts misunderstood, saintly ClarissaHarlowes forgotten or ignored, children neglected, exiles innocent ofwrong, all ye who enter life through barren ways, on whom men\'s faceseverywhere look coldly, to whom ears close and hearts are shut, ceaseyour complaints! You alone can know the infinitude of joy held in thatmoment when one heart opens to you, one ear listens, one look answersyours. A single day effaces all past evil. Sorrow, despondency, despair,and melancholy, passed but not forgotten, are links by which the soulthen fastens to its mate. Woman falls heir to all our past, our sighs,our lost illusions, and gives them back to us ennobled; she explainsthose former griefs as payment claimed by destiny for joys eternal,which she brings to us on the day our souls are wedded. The angels alonecan utter the new name by which that sacred love is called, and none butwomen, dear martyrs, truly know what Madame de Mortsauf now became tome--to me, poor and desolate.']"
85,3,Chapter 3,"['II. FIRST LOVEThis scene took place on a Tuesday. I waited until Sunday and did notcross the river. During those five days great events were happening atClochegourde. The count received his brevet as general of brigade, thecross of Saint Louis, and a pension of four thousand francs. The Ducde Lenoncourt-Givry, made peer of France, recovered possession of twoforests, resumed his place at court, and his wife regained all herunsold property, which had been made part of the imperial crown lands.The Comtesse de Mortsauf thus became an heiress. Her mother had arrivedat Clochegourde, bringing her a hundred thousand francs economized atGivry, the amount of her dowry, still unpaid and never asked for by thecount in spite of his poverty. In all such matters of external life theconduct of this man was proudly disinterested. Adding to this sum hisown few savings he was able to buy two neighboring estates, which wouldyield him some nine thousand francs a year. His son would of coursesucceed to the grandfather\'s peerage, and the count now saw his way toentail the estate upon him without injury to Madeleine, for whom the Ducde Lenoncourt would no doubt assist in promoting a good marriage.These arrangements and this new happiness shed some balm upon thecount\'s sore mind. The presence of the Duchesse de Lenoncourt atClochegourde was a great event to the neighborhood. I reflected gloomilythat she was a great lady, and the thought made me conscious of thespirit of caste in the daughter which the nobility of her sentimentshad hitherto hidden from me. Who was I--poor, insignificant, and withno future but my courage and my faculties? I did not then think of theconsequences of the Restoration either for me or for others. On Sundaymorning, from the private chapel where I sat with Monsieur and Madamede Chessel and the Abbe de Quelus, I cast an eager glance at anotherlateral chapel occupied by the duchess and her daughter, the count andhis children. The large straw hat which hid my idol from me did nottremble, and this unconsciousness of my presence seemed to bind meto her more than all the past. This noble Henriette de Lenoncourt, myHenriette, whose life I longed to garland, was praying earnestly; faithgave to her figure an abandonment, a prosternation, the attitude of somereligious statue, which moved me to the soul.According to village custom, vespers were said soon after mass. Comingout of church Madame de Chessel naturally proposed to her neighbors topass the intermediate time at Frapesle instead of crossing the Indre andthe meadows twice in the great heat. The offer was accepted. Monsieur deChessel gave his arm to the duchess, Madame de Chessel took that of thecount. I offered mine to the countess, and felt, for the first time,that beautiful arm against my side. As we walked from the church toFrapesle by the woods of Sache, where the light, filtering down throughthe foliage, made those pretty patterns on the path which seem likepainted silk, such sensations of pride, such ideas took possession of methat my heart beat violently.""What is the matter?"" she said, after walking a little way in a silenceI dared not break. ""Your heart beats too fast--""""I have heard of your good fortune,"" I replied, ""and, like all otherswho love truly, I am beset with vague fears. Will your new dignitieschange you and lessen your friendship?""""Change me!"" she said; ""oh, fie! Another such idea and I shall--notdespise you, but forget you forever.""I looked at her with an ecstasy which should have been contagious.""We profit by the new laws which we have neither brought about nordemanded,"" she said; ""but we are neither place-hunters nor beggars;besides, as you know very well, neither Monsieur de Mortsauf nor I canleave Clochegourde. By my advice he has declined the command to whichhis rank entitled him at the Maison Rouge. We are quite content that myfather should have the place. This forced modesty,"" she added with somebitterness, ""has already been of service to our son. The king, to whosehousehold my father is appointed, said very graciously that hewould show Jacques the favor we were not willing to accept. Jacques\'education, which must now be thought of, is already being discussed.He will be the representative of two houses, the Lenoncourt and theMortsauf families. I can have no ambition except for him, and thereforemy anxieties seem to have increased. Not only must Jacques live, buthe must be made worthy of his name; two necessities which, as you know,conflict. And then, later, what friend will keep him safe for me inParis, where all things are pitfalls for the soul and dangers for thebody? My friend,"" she said, in a broken voice, ""who could not see uponyour brow and in your eyes that you are one who will inhabit heights?Be some day the guardian and sponsor of our boy. Go to Paris; if yourfather and brother will not second you, our family, above all my mother,who has a genius for the management of life, will help you. Profit byour influence; you will never be without support in whatever career youchoose; put the strength of your desires into a noble ambition--""""I understand you,"" I said, interrupting her; ""ambition is to be mymistress. I have no need of that to be wholly yours. No, I will not berewarded for my obedience here by receiving favors there. I will go;I will make my own way; I will rise alone. From you I would accepteverything, from others nothing.""""Child!"" she murmured, ill-concealing a smile of pleasure.""Besides, I have taken my vows,"" I went on. ""Thinking over our situationI am resolved to bind myself to you by ties that never can be broken.""She trembled slightly and stopped short to look at me.""What do you mean?"" she asked, letting the couples who preceded us walkon, and keeping the children at her side.""This,"" I said; ""but first tell me frankly how you wish me to love you.""""Love me as my aunt loved me; I gave you her rights when I permitted youto call me by the name which she chose for her own among my others.""""Then I am to love without hope and with an absolute devotion. Well,yes; I will do for you what some men do for God. I shall feel that youhave asked it. I will enter a seminary and make myself a priest, andthen I will educate your son. Jacques shall be myself in his own form;political conceptions, thoughts, energy, patience, I will give him all.In that way I shall live near to you, and my love, enclosed in religionas a silver image in a crystal shrine, can never be suspected of evil.You will not have to fear the undisciplined passions which grasp a manand by which already I have allowed myself to be vanquished. I willconsume my own being in the flame, and I will love you with a purifiedlove.""She turned pale and said, hurrying her words: ""Felix, do not putyourself in bonds that might prove an obstacle to our happiness. Ishould die of grief for having caused a suicide like that. Child, do youthink despairing love a life\'s vocation? Wait for life\'s trials beforeyou judge of life; I command it. Marry neither the Church nor a woman;marry not at all,--I forbid it. Remain free. You are twenty-one yearsold--My God! can I have mistaken him? I thought two months sufficed toknow some souls.""""What hope have you?"" I cried, with fire in my eyes.""My friend, accept our help, rise in life, make your way and yourfortune and you shall know my hope. And,"" she added, as if she werewhispering a secret, ""never release the hand you are holding at thismoment.""She bent to my ear as she said these words which proved her deepsolicitude for my future.""Madeleine!"" I exclaimed ""never!""We were close to a wooden gate which opened into the park of Frapesle;I still seem to see its ruined posts overgrown with climbing plants andbriers and mosses. Suddenly an idea, that of the count\'s death, flashedthrough my brain, and I said, ""I understand you.""""I am glad of it,"" she answered in a tone which made me know I hadsupposed her capable of a thought that could never be hers.Her purity drew tears of admiration from my eyes which the selfishnessof passion made bitter indeed. My mind reacted and I felt that she didnot love me enough even to wish for liberty. So long as love recoilsfrom a crime it seems to have its limits, and love should be infinite. Aspasm shook my heart.""She does not love me,"" I thought.To hide what was in my soul I stooped over Madeleine and kissed herhair.""I am afraid of your mother,"" I said to the countess presently, to renewthe conversation.""So am I,"" she answered with a gesture full of childlike gaiety. ""Don\'tforget to call her Madame la duchesse, and to speak to her in the thirdperson. The young people of the present day have lost these politemanners; you must learn them; do that for my sake. Besides, it is suchgood taste to respect women, no matter what their age may be, and torecognize social distinctions without disputing them. The respect shownto established superiority is guarantee for that which is due to you.Solidarity is the basis of society. Cardinal Della Rovere and Raffaellewere two powers equally revered. You have sucked the milk of theRevolution in your academy and your political ideas may be influenced byit; but as you advance in life you will find that crude and ill-definedprinciples of liberty are powerless to create the happiness of thepeople. Before considering, as a Lenoncourt, what an aristocracy oughtto be, my common-sense as a woman of the people tells me that societiescan exist only through a hierarchy. You are now at a turning-point inyour life, when you must choose wisely. Be on our side,--especiallynow,"" she added, laughing, ""when it triumphs.""I was keenly touched by these words, in which the depth of her politicalfeeling mingled with the warmth of affection,--a combination which givesto women so great a power of persuasion; they know how to give to thekeenest arguments a tone of feeling. In her desire to justify all herhusband\'s actions Henriette had foreseen the criticisms that would risein my mind as soon as I saw the servile effects of a courtier\'s lifeupon him. Monsieur de Mortsauf, king in his own castle and surroundedby an historic halo, had, to my eyes, a certain grandiose dignity. Iwas therefore greatly astonished at the distance he placed between theduchess and himself by manners that were nothing less than obsequious. Aslave has his pride and will only serve the greatest despots. I confessI was humiliated at the degradation of one before whom I trembled as thepower that ruled my love. This inward repulsion made me understand themartyrdom of women of generous souls yoked to men whose meannesses theybury daily. Respect is a safeguard which protects both great and smallalike; each side can hold its own. I was respectful to the duchessbecause of my youth; but where others saw only a duchess I saw themother of my Henriette, and that gave sanctity to my homage.We reached the great court-yard of Frapesle, where we found the others.The Comte de Mortsauf presented me very gracefully to the duchess, whoexamined me with a cold and reserved air. Madame de Lenoncourt was thena woman fifty-six years of age, wonderfully well preserved and withgrand manners. When I saw the hard blue eyes, the hollow temples, thethin emaciated face, the erect, imposing figure slow of movement, andthe yellow whiteness of the skin (reproduced with such brilliancy in thedaughter), I recognized the cold type to which my own mother belonged,as quickly as a mineralogist recognizes Swedish iron. Her language wasthat of the old court; she pronounced the ""oit"" like ""ait,"" and said""frait"" for ""froid,"" ""porteux"" for ""porteurs."" I was not a courtier,neither was I stiff-backed in my manner to her; in fact I behaved sowell that as I passed the countess she said in a low voice, ""You areperfect.""The count came to me and took my hand, saying: ""You are not angry withme, Felix, are you? If I was hasty you will pardon an old soldier? Weshall probably stay here to dinner, and I invite you to dine with uson Thursday, the evening before the duchess leaves. I must go to Toursto-morrow to settle some business. Don\'t neglect Clochegourde. Mymother-in-law is an acquaintance I advise you to cultivate. Hersalon will set the tone for the faubourg St. Germain. She has all thetraditions of the great world, and possesses an immense amount of socialknowledge; she knows the blazon of the oldest as well as the newestfamily in Europe.""The count\'s good taste, or perhaps the advice of his domestic genius,appeared under his altered circumstances. He was neither arrogant noroffensively polite, nor pompous in any way, and the duchess was notpatronizing. Monsieur and Madame de Chessel gratefully accepted theinvitation to dinner on the following Thursday. I pleased the duchess,and by her glance I knew she was examining a man of whom her daughterhad spoken to her. As we returned from vespers she questioned me aboutmy family, and asked if the Vandenesse now in diplomacy was my relative.""He is my brother,"" I replied. On that she became almost affectionate.She told me that my great-aunt, the old Marquise de Listomere, was aGrandlieu. Her manners were as cordial as those of Monsieur de Mortsaufthe day he saw me for the first time; the haughty glance with whichthese sovereigns of the earth make you measure the distance that liesbetween you and them disappeared. I knew almost nothing of my family.The duchess told me that my great-uncle, an old abbe whose very name Idid not know, was to be member of the privy council, that my brother wasalready promoted, and also that by a provision of the Charter, of whichI had not yet heard, my father became once more Marquis de Vandenesse.""I am but one thing, the serf of Clochegourde,"" I said in a low voice tothe countess.The transformation scene of the Restoration was carried through with arapidity which bewildered the generation brought up under the imperialregime. To me this revolution meant nothing. The least word or gesturefrom Madame de Mortsauf were the sole events to which I attachedimportance. I was ignorant of what the privy council was, and knewas little of politics as of social life; my sole ambition was to loveHenriette better than Petrarch loved Laura. This indifference made theduchess take me for a child. A large company assembled at Frapesle andwe were thirty at table. What intoxication it is for a young man unusedto the world to see the woman he loves more beautiful than all othersaround her, the centre of admiring looks; to know that for him alone isreserved the chaste fire of those eyes, that none but he can discern inthe tones of that voice, in the words it utters, however gay or jestingthey may be, the proofs of unremitting thought. The count, delightedwith the attentions paid to him, seemed almost young; his wife lookedhopeful of a change; I amused myself with Madeleine, who, like allchildren with bodies weaker than their minds, made others laugh with herclever observations, full of sarcasm, though never malicious, andwhich spared no one. It was a happy day. A word, a hope awakened in themorning illumined nature. Seeing me so joyous, Henriette was joyful too.""This happiness smiling on my gray and cloudy life seems good,"" she saidto me the next day.That day I naturally spent at Clochegourde. I had been banished for fivedays, I was athirst for life. The count left at six in the morning forTours. A serious disagreement had arisen between mother and daughter.The duchess wanted the countess to move to Paris, where she promised hera place at court, and where the count, reconsidering his refusal, mightobtain some high position. Henriette, who was thought happy inher married life, would not reveal, even to her mother, her tragicsufferings and the fatal incapacity of her husband. It was to hide hiscondition from the duchess that she persuaded him to go to Tours andtransact business with his notaries. I alone, as she had truly said,knew the dark secret of Clochegourde. Having learned by experiencehow the pure air and the blue sky of the lovely valley calmed theexcitements and soothed the morbid griefs of the diseased mind, and whatbeneficial effect the life at Clochegourde had upon the health of herchildren, she opposed her mother\'s desire that she should leave it withreasons which the overbearing woman, who was less grieved than mortifiedby her daughter\'s bad marriage, vigorously combated.Henriette saw that the duchess cared little for Jacques andMadeleine,--a terrible discovery! Like all domineering mothers whoexpect to continue the same authority over their married daughters thatthey maintained when they were girls, the duchess brooked no opposition;sometimes she affected a crafty sweetness to force her daughter tocompliance, at other times a cold severity, intending to obtain by fearwhat gentleness had failed to win; then, when all means failed, shedisplayed the same native sarcasm which I had often observed in my ownmother. In those ten days Henriette passed through all the contentions ayoung woman must endure to establish her independence. You, who for yourhappiness have the best of mothers, can scarcely comprehend such trials.To gain a true idea of the struggle between that cold, calculating,ambitious woman and a daughter abounding in the tender natural kindnessthat never faileth, you must imagine a lily, to which my heart hasalways compared her, bruised beneath the polished wheels of a steel car.That mother had nothing in common with her daughter; she was unableeven to imagine the real difficulties which hindered her from takingadvantage of the Restoration and forced her to continue a life ofsolitude. Though families bury their internal dissensions with theutmost care, enter behind the scenes, and you will find in nearly allof them deep, incurable wounds, which lessen the natural affections.Sometimes these wounds are given by passions real and most affecting,rendered eternal by the dignity of those who feel them; sometimes bylatent hatreds which slowly freeze the heart and dry all tears when thehour of parting comes. Tortured yesterday and to-day, wounded by all,even by the suffering children who were guiltless of the ills theyendured, how could that poor soul fail to love the one human being whodid not strike her, who would fain have built a wall of defence aroundher to guard her from storms, from harsh contacts and cruel blows?Though I suffered from a knowledge of these debates, there were momentswhen I was happy in the sense that she rested upon my heart; for shetold me of these new troubles. Day by day I learned more fully themeaning of her words,--""Love me as my aunt loved me.""""Have you no ambition?"" the duchess said to me at dinner, with a sternair.""Madame,"" I replied, giving her a serious look, ""I have enough in me toconquer the world; but I am only twenty-one, and I am all alone.""She looked at her daughter with some astonishment. Evidently shebelieved that Henriette had crushed my ambition in order to keep menear her. The visit of Madame de Lenoncourt was a period of unrelievedconstraint. The countess begged me to be cautious; she was frightenedby the least kind word; to please her I wore the harness of deceit. Thegreat Thursday came; it was a day of wearisome ceremonial,--one ofthose stiff days which lovers hate, when their chair is no longer inits place, and the mistress of the house cannot be with them. Love has ahorror of all that does not concern itself. But the duchess returned atlast to the pomps and vanities of the court, and Clochegourde recoveredits accustomed order.My little quarrel with the count resulted in making me more at home inthe house than ever; I could go there at all times without hindrance;and the antecedents of my life inclined me to cling like a climbingplant to the beautiful soul which had opened to me the enchanting worldof shared emotions. Every hour, every minute, our fraternal marriage,founded on trust, became a surer thing; each of us settled firmly intoour own position; the countess enfolded me with her nurturing care, withthe white draperies of a love that was wholly maternal; while my lovefor her, seraphic in her presence, seared me as with hot irons whenaway from her. I loved her with a double love which shot its arrows ofdesire, and then lost them in the sky, where they faded out of sight inthe impermeable ether. If you ask me why, young and ardent, I continuedin the deluding dreams of Platonic love, I must own to you that I wasnot yet man enough to torture that woman, who was always in dread ofsome catastrophe to her children, always fearing some outburst of herhusband\'s stormy temper, martyrized by him when not afflicted by theillness of Jacques or Madeleine, and sitting beside one or the other ofthem when her husband allowed her a little rest. The mere sound of toowarm a word shook her whole being; a desire shocked her; what she neededwas a veiled love, support mingled with tenderness,--that, in short,which she gave to others. Then, need I tell you, who are so trulyfeminine? this situation brought with it hours of delightful languor,moments of divine sweetness and content which followed by secretimmolation. Her conscience was, if I may call it so, contagious; herself-devotion without earthly recompense awed me by its persistence; theliving, inward piety which was the bond of her other virtues filledthe air about her with spiritual incense. Besides, I was young,--youngenough to concentrate my whole being on the kiss she allowed me tooseldom to lay upon her hand, of which she gave me only the back, andnever the palm, as though she drew the line of sensual emotions there.No two souls ever clasped each other with so much ardor, no bodies wereever more victoriously annihilated. Later I understood the cause of thissufficing joy. At my age no worldly interests distracted my heart; noambitions blocked the stream of a love which flowed like a torrent,bearing all things on its bosom. Later, we love the woman in a woman;but the first woman we love is the whole of womanhood; her children areours, her interests are our interests, her sorrows our greatest sorrow;we love her gown, the familiar things about her; we are more grieved bya trifling loss of hers than if we knew we had lost everything. Thisis the sacred love that makes us live in the being of another; whereaslater, alas! we draw another life into ours, and require a woman toenrich our pauper spirit with her young soul.I was now one of the household, and I knew for the first time aninfinite sweetness, which to a nature bruised as mine was like a bathto a weary body; the soul is refreshed in every fibre, comforted to itsvery depths. You will hardly understand me, for you are a woman, andI am speaking now of a happiness women give but do not receive. A manalone knows the choice happiness of being, in the midst of a strangehousehold, the privileged friend of its mistress, the secret centreof her affections. No dog barks at you; the servants, like the dogs,recognize your rights; the children (who are never misled, and know thattheir power cannot be lessened, and that you cherish the light of theirlife), the children possess the gift of divination, they play with youlike kittens and assume the friendly tyranny they show only to thosethey love; they are full of intelligent discretion and come and go ontiptoe without noise. Every one hastens to do you service; all like you,and smile upon you. True passions are like beautiful flowers all themore charming to the eye when they grow in a barren soil.But if I enjoyed the delightful benefits of naturalization in a familywhere I found relations after my own heart, I had also to pay some costsfor it. Until then Monsieur de Mortsauf had more or less restrainedhimself before me. I had only seen his failings in the mass; I wasnow to see the full extent of their application and discover how noblycharitable the countess had been in the account she had given me ofthese daily struggles. I learned now all the angles of her husband\'sintolerable nature; I heard his perpetual scolding about nothing,complaints of evils of which not a sign existed; I saw the inwarddissatisfaction which poisoned his life, and the incessant need of histyrannical spirit for new victims. When we went to walk in the eveningshe selected the way; but whichever direction we took he was alwaysbored; when we reached home he blamed others; his wife had insisted ongoing where she wanted; why was he governed by her in all the triflingthings of life? was he to have no will, no thought of his own? musthe consent to be a cipher in his own house? If his harshness was to bereceived in patient silence he was angry because he felt a limit to hispower; he asked sharply if religion did not require a wife to pleaseher husband, and whether it was proper to despise the father of herchildren? He always ended by touching some sensitive chord in his wife\'smind; and he seemed to find a domineering pleasure in making it sound.Sometimes he tried gloomy silence and a morbid depression, which alwaysalarmed his wife and made her pay him the most tender attentions.Like petted children, who exercise their power without thinking of thedistress of their mother, he would let her wait upon him as upon Jacquesand Madeleine, of whom he was jealous.I discovered at last that in small things as well as in great ones thecount acted towards his servants, his children, his wife, precisely ashe had acted to me about the backgammon. The day when I understood,root and branch, these difficulties, which like a rampant overgrowthrepressed the actions and stifled the breathing of the whole family,hindered the management of the household and retarded the improvement ofthe estate by complicating the most necessary acts, I felt an admiringawe which rose higher than my love and drove it back into my heart. GoodGod! what was I? Those tears that I had taken on my lips solemnizedmy spirit; I found happiness in wedding the sufferings of that woman.Hitherto I had yielded to the count\'s despotism as the smuggler pays hisfine; henceforth I was a voluntary victim that I might come the nearerto her. The countess understood me, allowed me a place beside her, andgave me permission to share her sorrows; like the repentant apostate,eager to rise to heaven with his brethren, I obtained the favor of dyingin the arena.""Were it not for you I must have succumbed under this life,"" Henriettesaid to me one evening when the count had been, like the flies on a hotday, more stinging, venomous, and persistent than usual.He had gone to bed. Henriette and I remained under the acacias; thechildren were playing about us, bathed in the setting sun. Our fewexclamatory words revealed the mutuality of the thoughts in which werested from our common sufferings. When language failed silence asfaithfully served our souls, which seemed to enter one another withouthindrance; together they luxuriated in the charms of pensive languor,they met in the undulations of the same dream, they plunged as one intothe river and came out refreshed like two nymphs as closely united astheir souls could wish, but with no earthly tie to bind them. We enteredthe unfathomable gulf, we returned to the surface with empty hands,asking each other by a look, ""Among all our days on earth will there beone for us?""In spite of the tranquil poetry of evening which gave to the bricks ofthe balustrade their orange tones, so soothing and so pure; in spite ofthe religious atmosphere of the hour, which softened the voices of thechildren and wafted them towards us, desire crept through my veins likethe match to the bonfire. After three months of repression I was unableto content myself with the fate assigned me. I took Henriette\'s hand andsoftly caressed it, trying to convey to her the ardor that invaded me.She became at once Madame de Mortsauf, and withdrew her hand; tearsrolled from my eyes, she saw them and gave me a chilling look, as sheoffered her hand to my lips.""You must know,"" she said, ""that this will cause me grief. A friendshipthat asks so great a favor is dangerous.""Then I lost my self-control; I reproached her, I spoke of my sufferings,and the slight alleviation that I asked for them. I dared to tell herthat at my age, if the senses were all soul still the soul had a sex;that I could meet death, but not with closed lips. She forced me tosilence with her proud glance, in which I seemed to read the cry of theMexican: ""And I, am I on a bed of roses?"" Ever since that day by thegate of Frapesle, when I attributed to her the hope that our happinessmight spring from a grave, I had turned with shame from the thought ofstaining her soul with the desires of a brutal passion. She now spokewith honeyed lip, and told me that she never could be wholly mine, andthat I ought to know it. As she said the words I know that in obeyingher I dug an abyss between us. I bowed my head. She went on, saying shehad an inward religious certainty that she might love me as a brotherwithout offending God or man; such love was a living image of the divinelove, which her good Saint-Martin told her was the life of the world.If I could not be to her somewhat as her old confessor was, less than alover yet more than a brother, I must never see her again. She coulddie and take to God her sheaf of sufferings, borne not without tears andanguish.""I gave you,"" she said in conclusion, ""more than I ought to have given,so that nothing might be left to take, and I am punished.""I was forced to calm her, to promise never to cause her pain, and tolove her at twenty-one years of age as old men love their youngestchild.The next day I went early. There were no flowers in the vases of hergray salon. I rushed into the fields and vineyards to make her twobouquets; but as I gathered the flowers, one by one, cutting their longstalks and admiring their beauty, the thought occurred to me that thecolors and foliage had a poetry, a harmony, which meant something tothe understanding while they charmed the eye; just as musical melodiesawaken memories in hearts that are loving and beloved. If color is lightorganized, must it not have a meaning of its own, as the combinationsof the air have theirs? I called in the assistance of Jacques andMadeleine, and all three of us conspired to surprise our dear one. Iarranged, on the lower steps of the portico, where we establishedour floral headquarters, two bouquets by which I tried to convey asentiment. Picture to yourself a fountain of flowers gushing from thevases and falling back in curving waves; my message springing from itsbosom in white roses and lilies with their silver cups. All the blueflowers, harebells, forget-me-nots, and ox-tongues, whose tines, caughtfrom the skies, blended so well with the whiteness of the lilies,sparkled on this dewy texture; were they not the type of two purities,the one that knows nothing, the other that knows all; an image of thechild, an image of the martyr? Love has its blazon, and the countessdiscerned it inwardly. She gave me a poignant glance which was likethe cry of a soldier when his wound is touched; she was humbled butenraptured too. My reward was in that glance; to refresh her heart, tohave given her comfort, what encouragement for me! Then it was thatI pressed the theories of Pere Castel into the service of love, andrecovered a science lost to Europe, where written pages have supplantedthe flowery missives of the Orient with their balmy tints. What charm inexpressing our sensations through these daughters of the sun, sisters tothe flowers that bloom beneath the rays of love! Before long I communedwith the flora of the fields, as a man whom I met in after days atGrandlieu communed with his bees.Twice a week during the remainder of my stay at Frapesle I continued theslow labor of this poetic enterprise, for the ultimate accomplishment ofwhich I needed all varieties of herbaceous plants; into these I made adeep research, less as a botanist than as a poet, studying their spiritrather than their form. To find a flower in its native haunts I walkedenormous distances, beside the brooklets, through the valleys, to thesummit of the cliffs, across the moorland, garnering thoughts even fromthe heather. During these rambles I initiated myself into pleasuresunthought of by the man of science who lives in meditation, unknown tothe horticulturist busy with specialities, to the artisan fettered toa city, to the merchant fastened to his desk, but known to a fewforesters, to a few woodsmen, and to some dreamers. Nature can showeffects the significations of which are limitless; they rise to thegrandeur of the highest moral conceptions--be it the heather in bloom,covered with the diamonds of the dew on which the sunlight dances;infinitude decked for the single glance that may chance to fall uponit:--be it a corner of the forest hemmed in with time-worn rockscrumbling to gravel and clothed with mosses overgrown with juniper,which grasps our minds as something savage, aggressive, terrifying asthe cry of the kestrel issuing from it:--be it a hot and barren moorwithout vegetation, stony, rigid, its horizon like those of the desert,where once I gathered a sublime and solitary flower, the anemonepulsatilla, with its violet petals opening for the golden stamens;affecting image of my pure idol alone in her valley:--be it great sheetsof water, where nature casts those spots of greenery, a species oftransition between the plant and animal, where life makes haste to comein flowers and insects, floating there like worlds in ether:--be ita cottage with its garden of cabbages, its vineyards, its hedgesoverhanging a bog, surrounded by a few sparse fields of rye; true imageof many humble existences:--be it a forest path like some cathedralnave, where the trees are columns and their branches arch the roof, atthe far end of which a light breaks through, mingled with shadows ortinted with sunset reds athwart the leaves which gleam like the coloredwindows of a chancel:--then, leaving these woods so cool and branchy,behold a chalk-land lying fallow, where among the warm and cavernousmosses adders glide to their lairs, or lift their proud slim heads. Castupon all these pictures torrents of sunlight like beneficent waters,or the shadow of gray clouds drawn in lines like the wrinkles of an oldman\'s brow, or the cool tones of a sky faintly orange and streaked withlines of a paler tint; then listen--you will hear indefinable harmoniesamid a silence which blends them all.During the months of September and October I did not make a singlebouquet which cost me less than three hours search; so much did Iadmire, with the real sympathy of a poet, these fugitive allegories ofhuman life, that vast theatre I was about to enter, the scenes of whichmy memory must presently recall. Often do I now compare those splendidscenes with memories of my soul thus expending itself on nature; again Iwalk that valley with my sovereign, whose white robe brushed the coppiceand floated on the green sward, whose spirit rose, like a promisedfruit, from each calyx filled with amorous stamens.No declaration of love, no vows of uncontrollable passion ever conveyedmore than these symphonies of flowers; my baffled desires impelled me toefforts of expression through them like those of Beethoven through hisnotes, to the same bitter reactions, to the same mighty bounds towardsheaven. In their presence Madame de Mortsauf was my Henriette. Shelooked at them constantly; they fed her spirit, she gathered all thethoughts I had given them, saying, as she raised her head from theembroidery frame to receive my gift, ""Ah, how beautiful!""Natalie, you will understand this delightful intercourse through thedetails of a bouquet, just as you would comprehend Saadi from a fragmentof his verse. Have you ever smelt in the fields in the month of May theperfume that communicates to all created beings the intoxicating senseof a new creation; the sense that makes you trail your hand in the waterfrom a boat, and loosen your hair to the breeze while your mind reviveswith the springtide greenery of the trees? A little plant, a species ofvernal grass, is a powerful element in this veiled harmony; it cannot beworn with impunity; take into your hand its shining blade, striped greenand white like a silken robe, and mysterious emotions will stir therosebuds your modesty keeps hidden in the depths of your heart. Roundthe neck of a porcelain vase imagine a broad margin of the gray-whitetufts peculiar to the sedum of the vineyards of Touraine, vague imageof submissive forms; from this foundation come tendrils of the bind-weedwith its silver bells, sprays of pink rest-barrow mingled with a fewyoung shoots of oak-leaves, lustrous and magnificently colored;these creep forth prostrate, humble as the weeping-willow, timid andsupplicating as prayer. Above, see those delicate threads of the purpleamoret, with its flood of anthers that are nearly yellow; the snowypyramids of the meadow-sweet, the green tresses of the wild oats, theslender plumes of the agrostis, which we call wind-ear; roseate hopes,decking love\'s earliest dream and standing forth against the graysurroundings. But higher still, remark the Bengal roses, sparselyscattered among the laces of the daucus, the plumes of the linaria, themarabouts of the meadow-queen; see the umbels of the myrrh, the spunglass of the clematis in seed, the dainty petals of the cross-wort,white as milk, the corymbs of the yarrow, the spreading stems of thefumitory with their black and rosy blossoms, the tendrils of the grape,the twisted shoots of the honeysuckle; in short, all the innocentcreatures have that is most tangled, wayward, wild,--flames and tripledarts, leaves lanceolated or jagged, stalks convoluted like passionatedesires writhing in the soul. From the bosom of this torrent of loverises the scarlet poppy, its tassels about to open, spreading itsflaming flakes above the starry jessamine, dominating the rain ofpollen--that soft mist fluttering in the air and reflecting the light inits myriad particles. What woman intoxicated with the odor of the vernalgrasses would fail to understand this wealth of offered thoughts, theseardent desires of a love demanding the happiness refused in a hundredstruggles which passion still renews, continuous, unwearying, eternal!Put this speech of the flowers in the light of a window to show itscrisp details, its delicate contrasts, its arabesques of color, andallow the sovereign lady to see a tear upon some petal more expandedthan the rest. What do we give to God? perfumes, light, and song, thepurest expression of our nature. Well, these offerings to God, are theynot likewise offered to love in this poem of luminous flowers murmuringtheir sadness to the heart, cherishing its hidden transports, itsunuttered hopes, its illusions which gleam and fall to fragments likethe gossamer of a summer\'s night?Such neutral pleasures help to soothe a nature irritated by longcontemplation of the person beloved. They were to me, I dare not say toher, like those fissures in a dam through which the water finds a ventand avoids disaster. Abstinence brings deadly exhaustion, which afew crumbs falling from heaven like manna in the desert, suffices torelieve. Sometimes I found my Henriette standing before these bouquetswith pendant arms, lost in agitated reverie, thoughts swelling herbosom, illumining her brow as they surged in waves and sank again,leaving lassitude and languor behind them. Never again have I made abouquet for any one. When she and I had created this language and formedit to our uses, a satisfaction filled our souls like that of a slave whoescapes his masters.During the rest of this month as I came from the meadows through thegardens I often saw her face at the window, and when I reached the salonshe was ready at her embroidery frame. If I did not arrive at the hourexpected (though never appointed), I saw a white form wandering on theterrace, and when I joined her she would say, ""I came to meet you; Imust show a few attentions to my youngest child.""The miserable games of backgammon had come to end. The count\'s latepurchases took all his time in going hither and thither about theproperty, surveying, examining, and marking the boundaries of his newpossessions. He had orders to give, rural works to overlook which neededa master\'s eye,--all of them planned and decided on by his wife andhimself. We often went to meet him, the countess and I, with thechildren, who amused themselves on the way by running after insects,stag-beetles, darning-needles, they too making their bouquets, or tospeak more truly, their bundles of flowers. To walk beside the woman welove, to take her on our arm, to guide her steps,--these are illimitablejoys that suffice a lifetime. Confidence is then complete. We wentalone, we returned with the ""general,"" a title given to the count whenhe was good-humored. These two ways of taking the same path gave lightand shade to our pleasure, a secret known only to hearts debarred fromunion. Our talk, so free as we went, had hidden significations aswe returned, when either of us gave an answer to some furtiveinterrogation, or continued a subject, already begun, in the enigmaticphrases to which our language lends itself, and which women are soingenious in composing. Who has not known the pleasure of such secretunderstandings in a sphere apart from those about us, a sphere wherespirits meet outside of social laws?One day a wild hope, quickly dispelled, took possession of me, when thecount, wishing to know what we were talking of, put the inquiry,and Henriette answered in words that allowed another meaning, whichsatisfied him. This amused Madeleine, who laughed; after a moment hermother blushed and gave me a forbidding look, as if to say she mightstill withdraw from me her soul as she had once withdrawn her hand. Butour purely spiritual union had far too many charms, and on the morrow itcontinued as before.The hours, days, and weeks fled by, filled with renascent joys. Grapeharvest, the festal season in Touraine, began. Toward the end ofSeptember the sun, less hot than during the wheat harvest, allows of ourstaying in the vineyards without danger of becoming overheated. It iseasier to gather grapes than to mow wheat. Fruits of all kinds are ripe,harvests are garnered, bread is less dear; the sense of plenty makes thecountry people happy. Fears as to the results of rural toil, in whichmore money than sweat is often spent, vanish before a full granary andcellars about to overflow. The vintage is then like a gay dessert afterthe dinner is eaten; the skies of Touraine, where the autumns are alwaysmagnificent, smile upon it. In this hospitable land the vintagersare fed and lodged in the master\'s house. The meals are the onlyones throughout the year when these poor people taste substantial,well-cooked food; and they cling to the custom as the children ofpatriarchal families cling to anniversaries. As the time approaches theyflock in crowds to those houses where the masters are known to treat thelaborers liberally. The house is full of people and of provisions. Thepresses are open. The country is alive with the coming and going ofitinerant coopers, of carts filled with laughing girls and joyoushusbandmen, who earn better wages than at any other time duringthe year, and who sing as they go. There is also another cause ofpleasurable content: classes and ranks are equal; women, children,masters, and men, all that little world, share in the garnering ofthe divine hoard. These various elements of satisfaction explain thehilarity of the vintage, transmitted from age to age in these lastglorious days of autumn, the remembrance of which inspired Rabelais withthe bacchic form of his great work.The children, Jacques and Madeleine, had never seen a vintage; I waslike them, and they were full of infantine delight at finding a sharerof their pleasure; their mother, too, promised to accompany us. We wentto Villaines, where baskets are manufactured, in quest of the prettiestthat could be bought; for we four were to cut certain rows reserved forour scissors; it was, however, agreed that none of us were to eat toomany grapes. To eat the fat bunches of Touraine in a vineyard seemedso delicious that we all refused the finest grapes on the dinner-table.Jacques made me swear I would go to no other vineyard, but stay closelyat Clochegourde. Never were these frail little beings, usually pallidand smiling, so fresh and rosy and active as they were this morning.They chattered for chatter\'s sake, and trotted about without apparentobject; they suddenly seemed, like other children, to have more lifethan they needed; neither Monsieur nor Madame de Mortsauf had ever seenthem so before. I became a child again with them, more of a child thaneither of them, perhaps; I, too, was hoping for my harvest. It wasglorious weather when we went to the vineyard, and we stayed there halfthe day. How we disputed as to who had the finest grapes and who couldfill his basket quickest! The little human shoots ran to and fro fromthe vines to their mother; not a bunch could be cut without showing itto her. She laughed with the good, gay laugh of her girlhood when I,running up with my basket after Madeleine, cried out, ""Mine too! Seemine, mamma!"" To which she answered: ""Don\'t get overheated, dear child.""Then passing her hand round my neck and through my hair, she added,giving me a little tap on the cheek, ""You are melting away."" It wasthe only caress she ever gave me. I looked at the pretty line of purpleclusters, the hedges full of haws and blackberries; I heard the voicesof the children; I watched the trooping girls, the cart loaded withbarrels, the men with the panniers. Ah, it is all engraved on my memory,even to the almond-tree beside which she stood, girlish, rosy, smiling,beneath the sunshade held open in her hand. Then I busied myself incutting the bunches and filling my basket, going forward to empty itin the vat, silently, with measured bodily movement and slow steps thatleft my spirit free. I discovered then the ineffable pleasure of anexternal labor which carries life along, and thus regulates the rush ofpassion, often so near, but for this mechanical motion, to kindleinto flame. I learned how much wisdom is contained in uniform labor; Iunderstood monastic discipline.For the first time in many days the count was neither surly nor cruel.His son was so well; the future Duc de Lenoncourt-Mortsauf, fair androsy and stained with grape-juice, rejoiced his heart. This daybeing the last of the vintage, he had promised a dance in front ofClochegourde in honor of the return of the Bourbons, so that ourfestival gratified everybody. As we returned to the house, the countesstook my arm and leaned upon it, as if to let my heart feel the weight ofhers,--the instinctive movement of a mother who seeks to convey her joy.Then she whispered in my ear, ""You bring us happiness.""Ah, to me, who knew her sleepless nights, her cares, her fears, herformer existence, in which, although the hand of God sustained her, allwas barren and wearisome, those words uttered by that rich voice broughtpleasures no other woman in the world could give me.""The terrible monotony of my life is broken, all things are radiant withhope,"" she said after a pause. ""Oh, never leave me! Do not despise myharmless superstitions; be the elder son, the protector of the younger.""In this, Natalie, there is nothing romantic. To know the infinite of ourdeepest feelings, we must in youth cast our lead into those greatlakes upon whose shores we live. Though to many souls passions are lavatorrents flowing among arid rocks, other souls there be in whom passion,restrained by insurmountable obstacles, fills with purest water thecrater of the volcano.We had still another fete. Madame de Mortsauf, wishing to accustomher children to the practical things of life, and to give them someexperience of the toil by which men earn their living, had providedeach of them with a source of income, depending on the chances ofagriculture. To Jacques she gave the produce of the walnut-trees, toMadeleine that of the chestnuts. The gathering of the nuts began soonafter the vintage,--first the chestnuts, then the walnuts. To beatMadeleine\'s trees with a long pole and hear the nuts fall and rebound onthe dry, matted earth of a chestnut-grove; to see the serious gravity ofthe little girl as she examined the heaps and estimated their probablevalue, which to her represented many pleasures on which she counted;the congratulations of Manette, the trusted servant who alone suppliedMadame de Mortsauf\'s place with the children; the explanations of themother, showing the necessity of labor to obtain all crops, so oftenimperilled by the uncertainties of climate,--all these things made up acharming scene of innocent, childlike happiness amid the fading colorsof the late autumn.Madeleine had a little granary of her own, in which I was to see herbrown treasure garnered and share her delight. Well, I quiver still whenI recall the sound of each basketful of nuts as it was emptied on themass of yellow husks, mixed with earth, which made the floor of thegranary. The count bought what was needed for the household; the farmersand tenants, indeed, every one around Clochegourde, sent buyers to theMignonne, a pet name which the peasantry give even to strangers, butwhich in this case belonged exclusively to Madeleine.Jacques was less fortunate in gathering his walnuts. It rained forseveral days; but I consoled him with the advice to hold back his nutsand sell them a little later. Monsieur de Chessel had told me that thewalnut-trees in the Brehemont, also those about Amboise and Vouvray,were not bearing. Walnut oil is in great demand in Touraine. Jacquesmight get at least forty sous for the product of each tree, and as hehad two hundred the amount was considerable; he intended to spend it onthe equipment of a pony. This wish led to a discussion with his father,who bade him think of the uncertainty of such returns, and the wisdom ofcreating a reserve fund for the years when the trees might not bear,and so equalizing his resources. I felt what was passing through themother\'s mind as she sat by in silence; she rejoiced in the way Jacqueslistened to his father, the father seeming to recover the paternaldignity that was lacking to him, thanks to the ideas which she herselfhad prompted in him. Did I not tell you truly that in picturing thiswoman earthly language was insufficient to render either her characteror her spirit. When such scenes occurred my soul drank in their delightswithout analyzing them; but now, with what vigor they detach themselveson the dark background of my troubled life! Like diamonds they shineagainst the settling of thoughts degraded by alloy, of bitter regretsfor a lost happiness. Why do the names of the two estates purchasedafter the Restoration, and in which Monsieur and Madame de Mortsauf bothtook the deepest interest, the Cassine and the Rhetoriere, move me morethan the sacred names of the Holy Land or of Greece? ""Who loves, knows!""cried La Fontaine. Those names possess the talismanic power of wordsuttered under certain constellations by seers; they explain magic to me;they awaken sleeping forms which arise and speak to me; they lead me tothe happy valley; they recreate skies and landscape. But such evocationsare in the regions of the spiritual world; they pass in the silence ofmy own soul. Be not surprised, therefore, if I dwell on all these homelyscenes; the smallest details of that simple, almost common life areties which, frail as they may seem, bound me in closest union to thecountess.The interests of her children gave Madame de Mortsauf almost as muchanxiety as their health. I soon saw the truth of what she had told me asto her secret share in the management of the family affairs, into whichI became slowly initiated. After ten years\' steady effort Madame deMortsauf had changed the method of cultivating the estate. She had ""putit in fours,"" as the saying is in those parts, meaning the new systemunder which wheat is sown every four years only, so as to make the soilproduce a different crop yearly. To evade the obstinate unwillingness ofthe peasantry it was found necessary to cancel the old leases and givenew ones, to divide the estate into four great farms and let themon equal shares, the sort of lease that prevails in Touraine and itsneighborhood. The owner of the estate gives the house, farm-buildings,and seed-grain to tenants-at-will, with whom he divides the costs ofcultivation and the crops. This division is superintended by an agent orbailiff, whose business it is to take the share belonging to the owner;a costly system, complicated by the market changes of values, whichalter the character of the shares constantly. The countess had inducedMonsieur de Mortsauf to cultivate a fifth farm, made up of the reservedlands about Clochegourde, as much to occupy his mind as to show otherfarmers the excellence of the new method by the evidence of facts. Beingthus, in a hidden way, the mistress of the estate, she had slowlyand with a woman\'s persistency rebuilt two of the farm-houses on theprinciple of those in Artois and Flanders. It is easy to see her motive.She wished, after the expiration of the leases on shares, to relet tointelligent and capable persons for rental in money, and thus simplifythe revenues of Clochegourde. Fearing to die before her husband, shewas anxious to secure for him a regular income, and to her children aproperty which no incapacity could jeopardize. At the present time thefruit-trees planted during the last ten years were in full bearing; thehedges, which secured the boundaries from dispute, were in good order;the elms and poplars were growing well. With the new purchases and thenew farming system well under way, the estate of Clochegourde, dividedinto four great farms, two of which still needed new houses, was capableof bringing in forty thousand francs a year, ten thousand for each farm,not counting the yield of the vineyards, and the two hundred acres ofwoodland which adjoined them, nor the profits of the model home-farm.The roads to the great farms all opened on an avenue which followed astraight line from Clochegourde to the main road leading to Chinon.The distance from the entrance of this avenue to Tours was only fifteenmiles; tenants would never be wanting, especially now that everybody wastalking of the count\'s improvements and the excellent condition of hisland.The countess wished to put some fifteen thousand francs into each ofthe estates lately purchased, and to turn the present dwellings into twolarge farm-houses and buildings, in order that the property might bringin a better rent after the ground had been cultivated for a year or two.These ideas, so simple in themselves, but complicated with the thirtyodd thousand francs it was necessary to expend upon them, were just nowthe topic of many discussions between herself and the count, sometimesamounting to bitter quarrels, in which she was sustained by the thoughtof her children\'s interests. The fear, ""If I die to-morrow what willbecome of them?"" made her heart beat. The gentle, peaceful hearts towhom anger is an impossibility, and whose sole desire is to shed onthose about them their own inward peace, alone know what strength isneeded for such struggles, what demands upon the spirit must be madebefore beginning the contest, what weariness ensues when the fight isover and nothing has been won. At this moment, just as her childrenseemed less anemic, less frail, more active (for the fruit season hadhad its effect on them), and her moist eyes followed them as they playedabout her with a sense of contentment which renewed her strength andrefreshed her heart, the poor woman was called upon to bear the sharpsarcasms and attacks of an angry opposition. The count, alarmed at theplans she proposed, denied with stolid obstinacy the advantages of allshe had done and the possibility of doing more. He replied to conclusivereasoning with the folly of a child who denies the influence of thesun in summer. The countess, however, carried the day. The victoryof commonsense over insanity so healed her wounds that she forgot thebattle. That day we all went to the Cassine and the Rhetoriere, todecide upon the buildings. The count walked alone in front, the childrenwent next, and we ourselves followed slowly, for she was speaking in alow, gentle tone, which made her words like the murmur of the sea as itripples on a smooth beach.She was, she said, certain of success. A new line of communicationbetween Tours and Chinon was to be opened by an active man, a carrier,a cousin of Manette\'s, who wanted a large farm on the route. His familywas numerous; the eldest son would drive the carts, the second couldattend to the business, the father living half-way along the road, atRabelaye, one of the farms then to let, would look after the relays andenrich his land with the manure of the stables. As to the other farm, laBaude, the nearest to Clochegourde, one of their own people, a worthy,intelligent, and industrious man, who saw the advantages of the newsystem of agriculture, was ready to take a lease on it. The Cassine andthe Rhetoriere need give no anxiety; their soil was the very best in theneighborhood; the farm-houses once built, and the ground brought intocultivation, it would be quite enough to advertise them at Tours;tenants would soon apply for them. In two years\' time Clochegourde wouldbe worth at least twenty-four thousand francs a year. Gravelotte,the farm in Maine, which Monsieur de Mortsauf had recovered after theemigration, was rented for seven thousand francs a year for nine years;his pension was four thousand. This income might not be a fortune, butit was certainly a competence. Later, other additions to it might enableher to go to Paris and attend to Jacques\' education; in two years, shethought, his health would be established.With what feeling she uttered the word ""Paris!"" I knew her thought; shewished to be as little separated as possible from her friend. On that Ibroke forth; I told her that she did not know me; that without talkingof it, I had resolved to finish my education by working day and night soas to fit myself to be Jacques\' tutor. She looked grave.""No, Felix,"" she said, ""that cannot be, any more than your priesthood.I thank you from my heart as a mother, but as a woman who loves yousincerely I can never allow you to be the victim of your attachment tome. Such a position would be a social discredit to you, and I could notallow it. No! I cannot be an injury to you in any way. You, Vicomtede Vandenesse, a tutor! You, whose motto is \'Ne se vend!\' Were youRichelieu himself it would bar your way in life; it would give theutmost pain to your family. My friend, you do not know what insult womenof the world, like my mother, can put into a patronizing glance, whatdegradation into a word, what contempt into a bow.""""But if you love me, what is the world to me?""She pretended not to hear, and went on:--""Though my father is most kind and desirous of doing all I ask, he wouldnever forgive your taking so humble a position; he would refuse you hisprotection. I could not consent to your becoming tutor to the Dauphineven. You must accept society as it is; never commit the fault of flyingin the face of it. My friend, this rash proposal of--""""Love,"" I whispered.""No, charity,"" she said, controlling her tears, ""this wild ideaenlightens me as to your character; your heart will be your bane. Ishall claim from this moment the right to teach you certain things.Let my woman\'s eye see for you sometimes. Yes, from the solitudes ofClochegourde I mean to share, silently, contentedly, in your successes.As to a tutor, do not fear; we shall find some good old abbe, somelearned Jesuit, and my father will gladly devote a handsome sum to theeducation of the boy who is to bear his name. Jacques is my pride. Heis, however, eleven years old,"" she added after a pause. ""But it is withhim as with you; when I first saw you I took you to be about thirteen.""We now reached the Cassine, where Jacques, Madeleine, and I followed herabout as children follow a mother; but we were in her way; I left herpresently and went into the orchard where Martineau the elder, keeperof the place, was discussing with Martineau the younger, the bailiff,whether certain trees ought or ought not to be taken down; they werearguing the matter as if it concerned their own property. I then sawhow much the countess was beloved. I spoke of it to a poor laborer, who,with one foot on his spade and an elbow on its handle, stood listeningto the two doctors of pomology.""Ah, yes, monsieur,"" he answered, ""she is a good woman, and not haughtylike those hussies at Azay, who would see us die like dogs sooner thanyield us one penny of the price of a grave! The day when that womanleaves these parts the Blessed Virgin will weep, and we too. She knowswhat is due to her, but she knows our hardships, too, and she puts theminto the account.""With what pleasure I gave that man all the money I had.A few days later a pony arrived for Jacques, his father, an excellenthorseman, wishing to accustom the child by degrees to the fatiguesof such exercise. The boy had a pretty riding-dress, bought withthe product of the nuts. The morning when he took his first lessonaccompanied by his father and by Madeleine, who jumped and shouted aboutthe lawn round which Jacques was riding, was a great maternal festivalfor the countess. The boy wore a blue collar embroidered by her, alittle sky-blue overcoat fastened by a polished leather belt, a pair ofwhite trousers pleated at the waist, and a Scotch cap, from which hisfair hair flowed in heavy locks. He was charming to behold. All theservants clustered round to share the domestic joy. The little heirsmiled at his mother as he passed her, sitting erect, and quitefearless. This first manly act of a child to whom death had often seemedso near, the promise of a sound future warranted by this ride whichshowed him so handsome, so fresh, so rosy,--what a reward for all hercares! Then too the joy of the father, who seemed to renew his youth,and who smiled for the first time in many long months; the pleasureshown on all faces, the shout of an old huntsman of the Lenoncourts, whohad just arrived from Tours, and who, seeing how the boy held the reins,shouted to him, ""Bravo, monsieur le vicomte!""--all this was too much forthe poor mother, and she burst into tears; she, so calm in her griefs,was too weak to bear the joy of admiring her boy as he bounded over thegravel, where so often she had led him in the sunshine inwardly weepinghis expected death. She leaned upon my arm unreservedly, and said: ""Ithink I have never suffered. Do not leave us to-day.""The lesson over, Jacques jumped into his mother\'s arms; she caughthim and held him tightly to her, kissing him passionately. I went withMadeleine to arrange two magnificent bouquets for the dinner-tablein honor of the young equestrian. When we returned to the salon thecountess said: ""The fifteenth of October is certainly a great day withme. Jacques has taken his first riding lesson, and I have just set thelast stitch in my furniture cover.""""Then, Blanche,"" said the count, laughing, ""I must pay you for it.""He offered her his arm and took her to the first courtyard, where stoodan open carriage which her father had sent her, and for which the counthad purchased two English horses. The old huntsman had prepared thesurprise while Jacques was taking his lesson. We got into the carriage,and went to see where the new avenue entered the main road towardsChinon. As we returned, the countess said to me in an anxious tone, ""Iam too happy; to me happiness is like an illness,--it overwhelms me; Ifear it may vanish like a dream.""I loved her too passionately not to feel jealous,--I who could give hernothing! In my rage against myself I longed for some means of dying forher. She asked me to tell her the thoughts that filled my eyes, and Itold her honestly. She was more touched than by all her presents; thentaking me to the portico, she poured comfort into my heart. ""Love me asmy aunt loved me,"" she said, ""and that will be giving me your life; andif I take it, must I not ever be grateful to you?""It was time I finished my tapestry,"" she added as we re-entered thesalon, where I kissed her hand as if to renew my vows. ""Perhaps you donot know, Felix, why I began so formidable a piece of work. Men find theoccupations of life a great resource against troubles; the management ofaffairs distracts their mind; but we poor women have no support withinourselves against our sorrows. To be able to smile before my childrenand my husband when my heart was heavy I felt the need of controlling myinward sufferings by some physical exercise. In this way I escapedthe depression which is apt to follow a great strain upon the moralstrength, and likewise all outbursts of excitement. The mere action oflifting my arm regularly as I drew the stitches rocked my thoughts andgave to my spirit when the tempest raged a monotonous ebb and flowwhich seemed to regulate its emotions. To every stitch I confided mysecrets,--you understand me, do you not? Well, while doing my last chairI have thought much, too much, of you, dear friend. What you have putinto your bouquets I have said in my embroidery.""The dinner was lovely. Jacques, like all children when you take noticeof them, jumped into my arms when he saw the flowers I had arranged forhim as a garland. His mother pretended to be jealous; ah, Natalie, youshould have seen the charming grace with which the dear child offeredthem to her. In the afternoon we played a game of backgammon, I aloneagainst Monsieur and Madame de Mortsauf, and the count was charming.They accompanied me along the road to Frapesle in the twilight of atranquil evening, one of those harmonious evenings when our feelingsgain in depth what they lose in vivacity. It was a day of days inthis poor woman\'s life; a spot of brightness which often comforted herthoughts in painful hours.Soon, however, the riding lessons became a subject of contention. Thecountess justly feared the count\'s harsh reprimands to his son. Jacquesgrew thin, dark circles surrounded his sweet blue eyes; rather thantrouble his mother, he suffered in silence. I advised him to tellhis father he was tired when the count\'s temper was violent; but thatexpedient proved unavailing, and it became necessary to substitutethe old huntsman as a teacher in place of the father, who couldwith difficulty be induced to resign his pupil. Angry reproaches andcontentions began once more; the count found a text for his continualcomplaints in the base ingratitude of women; he flung the carriage,horses, and liveries in his wife\'s face twenty times a day. At last acircumstance occurred on which a man with his nature and his diseasenaturally fastened eagerly. The cost of the buildings at the Cassineand the Rhetoriere proved to be half as much again as the estimate.This news was unfortunately given in the first instance to Monsieur deMortsauf instead of to his wife. It was the ground of a quarrel, whichbegan mildly but grew more and more embittered until it seemed asthough the count\'s madness, lulled for a short time, was demanding itsarrearages from the poor wife.That day I had started from Frapesle at half-past ten to search forflowers with Madeleine. The child had brought the two vases to theportico, and I was wandering about the gardens and adjoining meadowsgathering the autumn flowers, so beautiful, but too rare. Returning frommy final quest, I could not find my little lieutenant with her whitecape and broad pink sash; but I heard cries within the house, andMadeleine presently came running out.""The general,"" she said, crying (the term with her was an expression ofdislike), ""the general is scolding mamma; go and defend her.""I sprang up the steps of the portico and reached the salon without beingseen by either the count or his wife. Hearing the madman\'s sharp criesI first shut all the doors, then I returned and found Henriette as whiteas her dress.""Never marry, Felix,"" said the count as soon as he saw me; ""a woman isled by the devil; the most virtuous of them would invent evil if it didnot exist; they are all vile.""Then followed arguments without beginning or end. Harking back tothe old troubles, Monsieur de Mortsauf repeated the nonsense of thepeasantry against the new system of farming. He declared that if he hadhad the management of Clochegourde he should be twice as rich as he nowwas. He shouted these complaints and insults, he swore, he sprang aroundthe room knocking against the furniture and displacing it; then in themiddle of a sentence he stopped short, complained that his very marrowwas on fire, his brains melting away like his money, his wife had ruinedhim! The countess smiled and looked upward.""Yes, Blanche,"" he cried, ""you are my executioner; you are killing me; Iam in your way; you want to get rid of me; you are monster of hypocrisy.She is smiling! Do you know why she smiles, Felix?""I kept silence and looked down.""That woman,"" he continued, answering his own question, ""denies me allhappiness; she is no more to me than she is to you, and yet she pretendsto be my wife! She bears my name and fulfils none of the duties whichall laws, human and divine, impose upon her; she lies to God and man.She obliges me to go long distances, hoping to wear me out and make meleave her to herself; I am displeasing to her, she hates me; she putsall her art into keeping me away from her; she has made me mad throughthe privations she imposes on me--for everything flies to my poor head;she is killing me by degrees, and she thinks herself a saint and takesthe sacrament every month!""The countess was weeping bitterly, humiliated by the degradation ofthe man, to whom she kept saying for all answer, ""Monsieur! monsieur!monsieur!""Though the count\'s words made me blush, more for him than for Henriette,they stirred my heart violently, for they appealed to the sense ofchastity and delicacy which is indeed the very warp and woof of firstlove.""She is virgin at my expense,"" cried the count.At these words the countess cried out, ""Monsieur!""""What do you mean with your imperious \'Monsieur!\'"" he shouted. ""Am I notyour master? Must I teach you that I am?""He came towards her, thrusting forward his white wolf\'s head, nowhideous, for his yellow eyes had a savage expression which made him looklike a wild beast rushing out of a wood. Henriette slid from her chairto the ground to avoid a blow, which however was not given; she lay atfull length on the floor and lost consciousness, completely exhausted.The count was like a murderer who feels the blood of his victim spurtingin his face; he stopped short, bewildered. I took the poor woman in myarms, and the count let me take her, as though he felt unworthy to touchher; but he went before me to open the door of her bedroom next thesalon,--a sacred room I had never entered. I put the countess on herfeet and held her for a moment in one arm, passing the other round herwaist, while Monsieur de Mortsauf took the eider-down coverlet from thebed; then together we lifted her and laid her, still dressed, on thebed. When she came to herself she motioned to us to unfasten her belt.Monsieur de Mortsauf found a pair of scissors, and cut through it; Imade her breathe salts, and she opened her eyes. The count left theroom, more ashamed than sorry. Two hours passed in perfect silence.Henriette\'s hand lay in mine; she pressed it to mine, but could notspeak. From time to time she opened her eyes as if to tell me by a lookthat she wished to be still and silent; then suddenly, for an instant,there seemed a change; she rose on her elbow and whispered, ""Unhappyman!--ah! if you did but know--""She fell back upon the pillow. The remembrance of her past sufferings,joined to the present shock, threw her again into the nervousconvulsions I had just calmed by the magnetism of love,--a power thenunknown to me, but which I used instinctively. I held her with gentleforce, and she gave me a look which made me weep. When the nervousmotions ceased I smoothed her disordered hair, the first and only timethat I ever touched it; then I again took her hand and sat lookingat the room, all brown and gray, at the bed with its simple chintzcurtains, at the toilet table draped in a fashion now discarded, at thecommonplace sofa with its quilted mattress. What poetry I could readin that room! What renunciations of luxury for herself; the only luxurybeing its spotless cleanliness. Sacred cell of a married nun, filledwith holy resignation; its sole adornments were the crucifix of her bed,and above it the portrait of her aunt; then, on each side of the holywater basin, two drawings of the children made by herself, with locksof their hair when they were little. What a retreat for a woman whoseappearance in the great world of fashion would have made the handsomestof her sex jealous! Such was the chamber where the daughter of anillustrious family wept out her days, sunken at this moment in anguish,and denying herself the love that might have comforted her. Hidden,irreparable woe! Tears of the victim for her slayer, tears of the slayerfor his victim! When the children and waiting-woman came at length intothe room I left it. The count was waiting for me; he seemed to seek meas a mediating power between himself and his wife. He caught my hands,exclaiming, ""Stay, stay with us, Felix!""""Unfortunately,"" I said, ""Monsieur de Chessel has a party, and myabsence would cause remark. But after dinner I will return.""He left the house when I did, and took me to the lower gate withoutspeaking; then he accompanied me to Frapesle, seeming not to know whathe was doing. At last I said to him, ""For heaven\'s sake, Monsieur lecomte, let her manage your affairs if it pleases her, and don\'t tormenther.""""I have not long to live,"" he said gravely; ""she will not suffer longthrough me; my head is giving way.""He left me in a spasm of involuntary self-pity. After dinner I returnedfor news of Madame de Mortsauf, who was already better. If such were thejoys of marriage, if such scenes were frequent, how could she survivethem long? What slow, unpunished murder was this? During that day Iunderstood the tortures by which the count was wearing out his wife.Before what tribunal can we arraign such crimes? These thoughts stunnedme; I could say nothing to Henriette by word of mouth, but I spent thenight in writing to her. Of the three or four letters that I wrote Ihave kept only the beginning of one, with which I was not satisfied.Here it is, for though it seems to me to express nothing, and to speaktoo much of myself when I ought only to have thought of her, it willserve to show you the state my soul was in:--  To Madame de Mortsauf:  How many things I had to say to you when I reached the house! I  thought of them on the way, but I forgot them in your presence.  Yes, when I see you, dear Henriette, I find my thoughts no longer  in keeping with the light from your soul which heightens your  beauty; then, too, the happiness of being near you is so ineffable  as to efface all other feelings. Each time we meet I am born into  a broader life; I am like the traveller who climbs a rock and sees  before him a new horizon. Each time you talk with me I add new  treasures to my treasury. There lies, I think, the secret of long  and inexhaustible affections. I can only speak to you of yourself  when away from you. In your presence I am too dazzled to see, too  happy to question my happiness, too full of you to be myself, too  eloquent through you to speak, too eager in seizing the present  moment to remember the past. You must think of this state of  intoxication and forgive me its consequent mistakes.  When near you I can only feel. Yet, I have courage to say, dear  Henriette, that never, in all the many joys you have given me,  never did I taste such joy as filled my soul when, after that  dreadful storm through which you struggled with superhuman  courage, you came to yourself alone with me, in the twilight of  your chamber where that unhappy scene had brought me. I alone  know the light that shines from a woman when through the portals  of death she re-enters life with the dawn of a rebirth tinting her  brow. What harmonies were in your voice! How words, even your  words, seemed paltry when the sound of that adored voice--in  itself the echo of past pains mingled with divine consolations  --blessed me with the gift of your first thought. I knew you were  brilliant with all human splendor, but yesterday I found a new  Henriette, who might be mine if God so willed; I beheld a spirit  freed from the bodily trammels which repress the ardors of the  soul. Ah! thou wert beautiful indeed in thy weakness, majestic in  thy prostration. Yesterday I found something more beautiful than  thy beauty, sweeter than thy voice; lights more sparkling than the  light of thine eyes, perfumes for which there are no words  --yesterday thy soul was visible and palpable. Would I could have  opened my heart and made thee live there! Yesterday I lost the  respectful timidity with which thy presence inspires me; thy  weakness brought us nearer together. Then, when the crisis passed  and thou couldst bear our atmosphere once more, I knew what it was  to breathe in unison with thy breath. How many prayers rose up to  heaven in that moment! Since I did not die as I rushed through  space to ask of God that he would leave thee with me, no human  creature can die of joy nor yet of sorrow. That moment has left  memories buried in my soul which never again will reappear upon  its surface and leave me tearless. Yes, the fears with which my  soul was tortured yesterday are incomparably greater than all  sorrows that the future can bring upon me, just as the joys which  thou hast given me, dear eternal thought of my life! will be  forever greater than any future joy God may be pleased to grant  me. Thou hast made me comprehend the love divine, that sure love,  sure in strength and in duration, that knows no doubt or jealousy.Deepest melancholy gnawed my soul; the glimpse into that hidden life wasagonizing to a young heart new to social emotions; it was an awful thingto find this abyss at the opening of life,--a bottomless abyss, a DeadSea. This dreadful aggregation of misfortunes suggested many thoughts;at my first step into social life I found a standard of comparison bywhich all other events and circumstances must seem petty.The next day when I entered the salon she was there alone. She looked atme for a moment, held out her hand, and said, ""My friend is always tootender."" Her eyes grew moist; she rose, and then she added, in a tone ofdesperate entreaty, ""Never write thus to me again.""Monsieur de Mortsauf was very kind. The countess had recovered hercourage and serenity; but her pallor betrayed the sufferings of theprevious night, which were calmed, but not extinguished. That eveningshe said to me, as she paced among the autumn leaves which rustledbeneath our footsteps, ""Sorrow is infinite; joys are limited,""--wordswhich betrayed her sufferings by the comparison she made with thefleeting delights of the previous week.""Do not slander life,"" I said to her. ""You are ignorant of love; lovegives happiness which shines in heaven.""""Hush!"" she said. ""I wish to know nothing of it. The Icelander woulddie in Italy. I am calm and happy beside you; I can tell you all mythoughts; do not destroy my confidence. Why will you not combine thevirtue of the priest with the charm of a free man.""""You make me drink the hemlock!"" I cried, taking her hand and laying iton my heart, which was beating fast.""Again!"" she said, withdrawing her hand as if it pained her. ""Are youdetermined to deny me the sad comfort of letting my wounds be stanchedby a friendly hand? Do not add to my sufferings; you do not know themall; those that are hidden are the worst to bear. If you were a womanyou would know the melancholy disgust that fills her soul when shesees herself the object of attentions which atone for nothing, but arethought to atone for all. For the next few days I shall be courted andcaressed, that I may pardon the wrong that has been done. I couldthen obtain consent to any wish of mine, however unreasonable. I amhumiliated by his humility, by caresses which will cease as soon ashe imagines that I have forgotten that scene. To owe our master\'s goodgraces to his faults--""""His crimes!"" I interrupted quickly.""Is not that a frightful condition of existence?"" she continued, with asad smile. ""I cannot use this transient power. At such times I am likethe knights who could not strike a fallen adversary. To see in the dusta man whom we ought to honor, to raise him only to enable him todeal other blows, to suffer from his degradation more than he suffershimself, to feel ourselves degraded if we profit by such influence foreven a useful end, to spend our strength, to waste the vigor of oursouls in struggles that have no grandeur, to have no power except for amoment when a fatal crisis comes--ah, better death! If I had no childrenI would let myself drift on the wretched current of this life; but if Ilose my courage, what will become of them? I must live for them, howevercruel this life may be. You talk to me of love. Ah! my dear friend,think of the hell into which I should fling myself if I gave thatpitiless being, pitiless like all weak creatures, the right to despiseme. The purity of my conduct is my strength. Virtue, dear friend, isholy water in which we gain fresh strength, from which we issue renewedin the love of God.""""Listen to me, dear Henriette; I have only another week to stay here,and I wish--""""Ah, you mean to leave us!"" she exclaimed.""You must know what my father intends to do with me,"" I replied. ""It isnow three months--""""I have not counted the days,"" she said, with momentaryself-abandonment. Then she checked herself and cried, ""Come, let us goto Frapesle.""She called the count and the children, sent for a shawl, and when allwere ready she, usually so calm and slow in all her movements, becameas active as a Parisian, and we started in a body to pay a visit atFrapesle which the countess did not owe. She forced herself to talk toMadame de Chessel, who was fortunately discursive in her answers. Thecount and Monsieur de Chessel conversed on business. I was afraid theformer might boast of his carriage and horses; but he committed no suchsolecisms. His neighbor questioned him about his projected improvementsat the Cassine and the Rhetoriere. I looked at the count, wondering ifhe would avoid a subject of conversation so full of painful memoriesto all, so cruelly mortifying to him. On the contrary, he explained howurgent a duty it was to better the agricultural condition of the canton,to build good houses and make the premises salubrious; in short, heglorified himself with his wife\'s ideas. I blushed as I looked ather. Such want of scruple in a man who, on certain occasions, could bescrupulous enough, this oblivion of the dreadful scene, this adoption ofideas against which he had fought so violently, this confident belief inhimself, petrified me.When Monsieur de Chessel said to him, ""Do you expect to recover youroutlay?""""More than recover it!"" he exclaimed, with a confident gesture.Such contradictions can be explained only by the word ""insanity.""Henriette, celestial creature, was radiant. The count was appearingto be a man of intelligence, a good administrator, an excellentagriculturist; she played with her boy\'s curly head, joyous for him,happy for herself. What a comedy of pain, what mockery in this drama;I was horrified by it. Later in life, when the curtain of the world\'sstage was lifted before me, how many other Mortsaufs I saw without theloyalty and the religious faith of this man. What strange, relentlesspower is it that perpetually awards an angel to a madman; to a man ofheart, of true poetic passion, a base woman; to the petty, grandeur;to this demented brain, a beautiful, sublime being; to Juana, CaptainDiard, whose history at Bordeaux I have told you; to Madame deBeauseant, an Ajuda; to Madame d\'Aiglemont, her husband; to the Marquisd\'Espard, his wife! Long have I sought the meaning of this enigma. Ihave ransacked many mysteries, I have discovered the reason of manynatural laws, the purport of some divine hieroglyphics; of the meaningof this dark secret I know nothing. I study it as I would the form of anIndian weapon, the symbolic construction of which is known only to theBrahmans. In this dread mystery the spirit of Evil is too visibly themaster; I dare not lay the blame to God. Anguish irremediable, whatpower finds amusement in weaving you? Can Henriette and her mysteriousphilosopher be right? Does their mysticism contain the explanation ofhumanity?The autumn leaves were falling during the last few days which I passedin the valley, days of lowering clouds, which do sometimes obscure theheaven of Touraine, so pure, so warm at that fine season. The eveningbefore my departure Madame de Mortsauf took me to the terrace beforedinner.""My dear Felix,"" she said, after we had taken a turn in silence underthe leafless trees, ""you are about to enter the world, and I wish to gowith you in thought. Those who have suffered much have lived and knownmuch. Do not think that solitary souls know nothing of the world; on thecontrary, they are able to judge it. Hear me: If I am to live in andfor my friend I must do what I can for his heart and for his conscience.When the conflict rages it is hard to remember rules; therefore let megive you a few instructions, the warnings of a mother to her son. Theday you leave us I shall give you a letter, a long letter, in which youwill find my woman\'s thoughts on the world, on society, on men, onthe right methods of meeting difficulty in this great clash of humaninterests. Promise me not to read this letter till you reach Paris. Iask it from a fanciful sentiment, one of those secrets of womanhood notimpossible to understand, but which we grieve to find deciphered; leaveme this covert way where as a woman I wish to walk alone.""""Yes, I promise it,"" I said, kissing her hand.""Ah,"" she added, ""I have one more promise to ask of you; but grant itfirst.""""Yes, yes!"" I cried, thinking it was surely a promise of fidelity.""It does not concern myself,"" she said smiling, with some bitterness.""Felix, do not gamble in any house, no matter whose it be; I exceptnone.""""I will never play at all,"" I replied.""Good,"" she said. ""I have found a better use for your time than to wasteit on cards. The end will be that where others must sooner or later belosers you will invariably win.""""How so?""""The letter will tell you,"" she said, with a playful smile, which tookfrom her advice the serious tone which might certainly have been that ofa grandfather.The countess talked to me for an hour, and proved the depth of heraffection by the study she had made of my nature during the last threemonths. She penetrated the recesses of my heart, entering it with herown; the tones of her voice were changeful and convincing; the wordsfell from maternal lips, showing by their tone as well as by theirmeaning how many ties already bound us to each other.""If you knew,"" she said in conclusion, ""with what anxiety I shall followyour course, what joy I shall feel if you walk straight, what tears Imust shed if you strike against the angles! Believe that my affectionhas no equal; it is involuntary and yet deliberate. Ah, I would that Imight see you happy, powerful, respected,--you who are to me a livingdream.""She made me weep, so tender and so terrible was she. Her feelings cameboldly to the surface, yet they were too pure to give the slightest hopeeven to a young man thirsting for pleasure. Ignoring my tortured flesh,she shed the rays, undeviating, incorruptible, of the divine love,which satisfies the soul only. She rose to heights whither the prismaticpinions of a love like mine were powerless to bear me. To reach her aman must needs have won the white wings of the seraphim.""In all that happens to me I will ask myself,"" I said, ""\'What would myHenriette say?\'""""Yes, I will be the star and the sanctuary both,"" she said, alluding tothe dreams of my childhood.""You are my light and my religion,"" I cried; ""you shall be my all.""""No,"" she answered; ""I can never be the source of your pleasures.""She sighed; the smile of secret pain was on her lips, the smile of theslave who momentarily revolts. From that day forth she was to me, notmerely my beloved, but my only love; she was not IN my heart as awoman who takes a place, who makes it hers by devotion or by excessof pleasure given; but she was my heart itself,--it was all hers, asomething necessary to the play of my muscles. She became to me asBeatrice to the Florentine, as the spotless Laura to the Venetian, themother of great thoughts, the secret cause of resolutions which savedme, the support of my future, the light shining in the darkness like alily in a wood. Yes, she inspired those high resolves which pass throughflames, which save the thing in peril; she gave me a constancy likeColigny\'s to vanquish conquerors, to rise above defeat, to weary thestrongest wrestler.The next day, having breakfasted at Frapesle and bade adieu to my kindhosts, I went to Clochegourde. Monsieur and Madame de Mortsauf hadarranged to drive with me to Tours, whence I was to start the same nightfor Paris. During the drive the countess was silent; she pretendedat first to have a headache; then she blushed at the falsehood, andexpiated it by saying that she could not see me go without regret.The count invited me to stay with them whenever, in the absence of theChessels, I might long to see the valley of the Indre once more. Weparted heroically, without apparent tears, but Jacques, who like otherdelicate children was quickly touched, began to cry, while Madeleine,already a woman, pressed her mother\'s hand.""Dear little one!"" said the countess, kissing Jacques passionately.When I was alone at Tours after dinner a wild, inexplicable desire knownonly to young blood possessed me. I hired a horse and rode from Toursto Pont-de-Ruan in an hour and a quarter. There, ashamed of my folly, Idismounted, and went on foot along the road, stepping cautiously likea spy till I reached the terrace. The countess was not there, and Iimagined her ill; I had kept the key of the little gate, by which Inow entered; she was coming down the steps of the portico with the twochildren to breathe in sadly and slowly the tender melancholy of thelandscape, bathed at that moment in the setting sun.""Mother, here is Felix,"" said Madeleine.""Yes,"" I whispered; ""it is I. I asked myself why I should stay at Tourswhile I still could see you; why not indulge a desire that in a few daysmore I could not gratify.""""He won\'t leave us again, mother,"" cried Jacques, jumping round me.""Hush!"" said Madeleine; ""if you make such a noise the general willcome.""""It is not right,"" she said. ""What folly!""The tears in her voice were the payment of what must be called ausurious speculation of love.""I had forgotten to return this key,"" I said smiling.""Then you will never return,"" she said.""Can we ever be really parted?"" I asked, with a look which made her dropher eyelids for all answer.I left her after a few moments passed in that happy stupor of the spiritwhere exaltation ends and ecstasy begins. I went with lagging step,looking back at every minute. When, from the summit of the hill, I sawthe valley for the last time I was struck with the contrast it presentedto what it was when I first came there. Then it was verdant, then itglowed, glowed and blossomed like my hopes and my desires. Initiated nowinto the gloomy secrets of a family, sharing the anguish of a ChristianNiobe, sad with her sadness, my soul darkened, I saw the valley in thetone of my own thoughts. The fields were bare, the leaves of the poplarsfalling, the few that remained were rusty, the vine-stalks were burned,the tops of the trees were tan-colored, like the robes in which royaltyonce clothed itself as if to hide the purple of its power beneath thebrown of grief. Still in harmony with my thoughts, the valley, where theyellow rays of the setting sun were coldly dying, seemed to me a livingimage of my heart.To leave a beloved woman is terrible or natural, according as the mindtakes it. For my part, I found myself suddenly in a strange land ofwhich I knew not the language. I was unable to lay hold of things towhich my soul no longer felt attachment. Then it was that the heightand the breadth of my love came before me; my Henriette rose in all hermajesty in this desert where I existed only through thoughts of her.That form so worshipped made me vow to keep myself spotless before mysoul\'s divinity, to wear ideally the white robe of the Levite, likePetrarch, who never entered Laura\'s presence unless clothed in white.With what impatience I awaited the first night of my return to myfather\'s roof, when I could read the letter which I felt of during thejourney as a miser fingers the bank-bills he carries about him. Duringthe night I kissed the paper on which my Henriette had manifested herwill; I sought to gather the mysterious emanations of her hand, torecover the intonations of her voice in the hush of my being. Since thenI have never read her letters except as I read that first letter; inbed, amid total silence. I cannot understand how the letters of ourbeloved can be read in any other way; yet there are men, unworthy tobe loved, who read such letters in the turmoil of the day, laying themaside and taking them up again with odious composure.Here, Natalie, is the voice which echoed through the silence of thatnight. Behold the noble figure which stood before me and pointed to theright path among the cross-ways at which I stood.  To Monsieur le Vicomte Felix de Vandenesse:  What happiness for me, dear friend, to gather the scattered  elements of my experience that I may arm you against the dangers  of the world, through which I pray that you pass scatheless. I  have felt the highest pleasures of maternal love as night after  night I have thought of these things. While writing this letter,  sentence by sentence, projecting my thoughts into the life you are  about to lead, I went often to my window. Looking at the towers of  Frapesle, visible in the moonlight, I said to myself, ""He sleeps,  I wake for him."" Delightful feelings! which recall the happiest of  my life, when I watched Jacques sleeping in his cradle and waited  till he wakened, to feed him with my milk. You are the man-child  whose soul must now be strengthened by precepts never taught in  schools, but which we women have the privilege of inculcating.  These precepts will influence your success; they prepare the way  for it, they will secure it. Am I not exercising a spiritual  motherhood in giving you a standard by which to judge the actions  of your life; a motherhood comprehended, is it not, by the child?  Dear Felix, let me, even though I may make a few mistakes, let me  give to our friendship a proof of the disinterestedness which  sanctifies it.  In yielding you to the world I am renouncing you; but I love you  too well not to sacrifice my happiness to your welfare. For the  last four months you have made me reflect deeply on the laws and  customs which regulate our epoch. The conversations I have had  with my aunt, well-known to you who have replaced her, the events  of Monsieur de Mortsauf\'s life, which he has told me, the tales  related by my father, to whom society and the court are familiar  in their greatest as well as in their smallest aspects, all these  have risen in my memory for the benefit of my adopted child at the  moment when he is about to be launched, well-nigh alone, among  men; about to act without adviser in a world where many are  wrecked by their own best qualities thoughtlessly displayed, while  others succeed through a judicious use of their worst.  I ask you to ponder this statement of my opinion of society as a  whole; it is concise, for to you a few words are sufficient.  I do not know whether societies are of divine origin or whether  they were invented by man. I am equally ignorant of the direction  in which they tend. What I do know certainly is the fact of their  existence. No sooner therefore do you enter society, instead of  living a life apart, than you are bound to consider its conditions  binding; a contract is signed between you. Does society in these  days gain more from a man than it returns to him? I think so; but  as to whether the individual man finds more cost than profit, or  buys too dear the advantages he obtains, concerns the legislator  only; I have nothing to say to that. In my judgment you are bound  to obey in all things the general law, without discussion, whether  it injures or benefits your personal interests. This principle may  seem to you a very simple one, but it is difficult of application;  it is like sap, which must infiltrate the smallest of the  capillary tubes to stir the tree, renew its verdure, develop its  flowers, and ripen fruit. Dear, the laws of society are not all  written in a book; manners and customs create laws, the more  important of which are often the least known. Believe me, there  are neither teachers, nor schools, nor text-books for the laws  that are now to regulate your actions, your language, your visible  life, the manner of your presentation to the world, and your quest  of fortune. Neglect those secret laws or fail to understand them,  and you stay at the foot of the social system instead of looking  down upon it. Even though this letter may seem to you diffuse,  telling you much that you have already thought, let me confide to  you a woman\'s ethics.  To explain society on the theory of individual happiness adroitly  won at the cost of the greater number is a monstrous doctrine,  which in its strict application leads men to believe that all they  can secretly lay hold of before the law or society or other  individuals condemn it as a wrong is honestly and fairly theirs.  Once admit that claim and the clever thief goes free; the woman  who violates her marriage vow without the knowledge of the world  is virtuous and happy; kill a man, leaving no proof for justice,  and if, like Macbeth, you win a crown you have done wisely; your  selfish interests become the higher law; the only question then is  how to evade, without witnesses or proof, the obstacles which law  and morality place between you and your self-indulgence. To those  who hold this view of society, the problem of making their  fortune, my dear friend, resolves itself into playing a game where  the stakes are millions or the galleys, political triumphs or  dishonor. Still, the green cloth is not long enough for all the  players, and a certain kind of genius is required to play the  game. I say nothing of religious beliefs, nor yet of feelings;  what concerns us now is the running-gear of the great machine of  gold and iron, and its practical results with which men\'s lives  are occupied. Dear child of my heart, if you share my horror at  this criminal theory of the world, society will present to your  mind, as it does to all sane minds, the opposite theory of duty.  Yes, you will see that man owes himself to man in a thousand  differing ways. To my mind, the duke and peer owe far more to the  workman and the pauper than the pauper and the workman owe to the  duke. The obligations of duty enlarge in proportion to the  benefits which society bestows on men; in accordance with the  maxim, as true in social politics as in business, that the burden  of care and vigilance is everywhere in proportion to profits. Each  man pays his debt in his own way. When our poor toiler at the  Rhetoriere comes home weary with his day\'s work has he not done  his duty? Assuredly he has done it better than many in the ranks  above him.  If you take this view of society, in which you are about to seek a  place in keeping with your intellect and your faculties, you must  set before you as a generating principle and mainspring, this  maxim: never permit yourself to act against either your own  conscience or the public conscience. Though my entreaty may seem  to you superfluous, yet I entreat, yes, your Henriette implores  you to ponder the meaning of that rule. It seems simple but, dear,  it means that integrity, loyalty, honor, and courtesy are the  safest and surest instruments for your success. In this selfish  world you will find many to tell you that a man cannot make his  way by sentiments, that too much respect for moral considerations  will hinder his advance. It is not so; you will see men  ill-trained, ill-taught, incapable of measuring the future, who are  rough to a child, rude to an old woman, unwilling to be irked by  some worthy old man on the ground that they can do nothing for  him; later, you will find the same men caught by the thorns which  they might have rendered pointless, and missing their triumph for  some trivial reason; whereas the man who is early trained to a  sense of duty does not meet the same obstacles; he may attain  success less rapidly, but when attained it is solid and does not  crumble like that of others.  When I show you that the application of this doctrine demands in  the first place a mastery of the science of manners, you may think  my jurisprudence has a flavor of the court and of the training I  received as a Lenoncourt. My dear friend, I do attach great  importance to that training, trifling as it seems. You will find  that the habits of the great world are as important to you as the  wide and varied knowledge that you possess. Often they take the  place of such knowledge; for some really ignorant men, born with  natural gifts and accustomed to give connection to their ideas,  have been known to attain a grandeur never reached by others far  more worthy of it. I have studied you thoroughly, Felix, wishing  to know if your education, derived wholly from schools, has  injured your nature. God knows the joy with which I find you fit  for that further education of which I speak.  The manners of many who are brought up in the traditions of the  great world are purely external; true politeness, perfect manners,  come from the heart, and from a deep sense of personal dignity.  This is why some men of noble birth are, in spite of their  training, ill-mannered, while others, among the middle classes,  have instinctive good taste and only need a few lessons to give  them excellent manners without any signs of awkward imitation.  Believe a poor woman who no longer leaves her valley when she  tells you that this dignity of tone, this courteous simplicity in  words, in gesture, in bearing, and even in the character of the  home, is a living and material poem, the charm of which is  irresistible; imagine therefore what it is when it takes its  inspiration from the heart. Politeness, dear, consists in seeming  to forget ourselves for others; with many it is social cant, laid  aside when personal self-interest shows its cloven-foot; a noble  then becomes ignoble. But--and this is what I want you to  practise, Felix--true politeness involves a Christian principle;  it is the flower of Love, it requires that we forget ourselves  really. In memory of your Henriette, for her sake, be not a  fountain without water, have the essence and the form of true  courtesy. Never fear to be the dupe and victim of this social  virtue; you will some day gather the fruit of seeds scattered  apparently to the winds.  My father used to say that one of the great offences of sham  politeness was the neglect of promises. When anything is demanded  of you that you cannot do, refuse positively and leave no  loopholes for false hopes; on the other hand, grant at once  whatever you are willing to bestow. Your prompt refusal will make  you friends as well as your prompt benefit, and your character  will stand the higher; for it is hard to say whether a promise  forgotten, a hope deceived does not make us more enemies than a  favor granted brings us friends.  Dear friend, there are certain little matters on which I may  dwell, for I know them, and it comes within my province to impart  them. Be not too confiding, nor frivolous, nor over enthusiastic,  --three rocks on which youth often strikes. Too confiding a nature  loses respect, frivolity brings contempt, and others take  advantage of excessive enthusiasm. In the first place, Felix, you  will never have more than two or three friends in the course of  your life. Your entire confidence is their right; to give it to  many is to betray your real friends. If you are more intimate with  some men than with others keep guard over yourself; be as cautious  as though you knew they would one day be your rivals, or your  enemies; the chances and changes of life require this. Maintain an  attitude which is neither cold nor hot; find the medium point at  which a man can safely hold intercourse with others without  compromising himself. Yes, believe me, the honest man is as far  from the base cowardice of Philinte as he is from the harsh virtue  of Alceste. The genius of the poet is displayed in the mind of  this true medium; certainly all minds do enjoy more the ridicule  of virtue than the sovereign contempt of easy-going selfishness  which underlies that picture of it; but all, nevertheless, are  prompted to keep themselves from either extreme.  As to frivolity, if it causes fools to proclaim you a charming  man, others who are accustomed to judge of men\'s capacities and  fathom character, will winnow out your tare and bring you to  disrepute, for frivolity is the resource of weak natures, and  weakness is soon appraised in a society which regards its members  as nothing more than organs--and perhaps justly, for nature  herself puts to death imperfect beings. A woman\'s protecting  instincts may be roused by the pleasure she feels in supporting  the weak against the strong, and in leading the intelligence of  the heart to victory over the brutality of matter; but society,  less a mother than a stepmother, adores only the children who  flatter her vanity.  As to ardent enthusiasm, that first sublime mistake of youth,  which finds true happiness in using its powers, and begins by  being its own dupe before it is the dupe of others, keep it within  the region of the heart\'s communion, keep it for woman and for  God. Do not hawk its treasures in the bazaars of society or of  politics, where trumpery will be offered in exchange for them.  Believe the voice which commands you to be noble in all things  when it also prays you not to expend your forces uselessly.  Unhappily, men will rate you according to your usefulness, and not  according to your worth. To use an image which I think will strike  your poetic mind, let a cipher be what it may, immeasurable in  size, written in gold, or written in pencil, it is only a cipher  after all. A man of our times has said, ""No zeal, above all, no  zeal!"" The lesson may be sad, but it is true, and it saves the  soul from wasting its bloom. Hide your pure sentiments, or put  them in regions inaccessible, where their blossoms may be  passionately admired, where the artist may dream amorously of his  master-piece. But duties, my friend, are not sentiments. To do  what we ought is by no means to do what we like. A man who would  give his life enthusiastically for a woman must be ready to die  coldly for his country.  One of the most important rules in the science of manners is that  of almost absolute silence about ourselves. Play a little comedy  for your own instruction; talk of yourself to acquaintances, tell  them about your sufferings, your pleasures, your business, and you  will see how indifference succeeds pretended interest; then  annoyance follows, and if the mistress of the house does not find  some civil way of stopping you the company will disappear under  various pretexts adroitly seized. Would you, on the other hand,  gather sympathies about you and be spoken of as amiable and witty,  and a true friend? talk to others of themselves, find a way to  bring them forward, and brows will clear, lips will smile, and  after you leave the room all present will praise you. Your  conscience and the voice of your own heart will show you the line  where the cowardice of flattery begins and the courtesy of  intercourse ceases.  One word more about a young man\'s demeanor in public. My dear  friend, youth is always inclined to a rapidity of judgment which  does it honor, but also injury. This was why the old system of  education obliged young people to keep silence and study life in a  probationary period beside their elders. Formerly, as you know,  nobility, like art, had its apprentices, its pages, devoted body  and soul to the masters who maintained them. To-day youth is  forced in a hot-house; it is trained to judge of thoughts,  actions, and writings with biting severity; it slashes with a  blade that has not been fleshed. Do not make this mistake. Such  judgments will seem like censures to many about you, who would  sooner pardon an open rebuke than a secret wound. Young people are  pitiless because they know nothing of life and its difficulties.  The old critic is kind and considerate, the young critic is  implacable; the one knows nothing, the other knows all. Moreover,  at the bottom of all human actions there is a labyrinth of  determining reasons on which God reserves for himself the final  judgment. Be severe therefore to none but yourself.  Your future is before you; but no one in the world can make his  way unaided. Therefore, make use of my father\'s house; its doors  are open to you; the connections that you will create for yourself  under his roof will serve you in a hundred ways. But do not yield  an inch of ground to my mother; she will crush any one who gives  up to her, but she will admire the courage of whoever resists her.  She is like iron, which if beaten, can be fused with iron, but  when cold will break everything less hard than itself. Cultivate  my mother; for if she thinks well of you she will introduce you  into certain houses where you can acquire the fatal science of the  world, the art of listening, speaking, answering, presenting  yourself to the company and taking leave of it; the precise use of  language, the something--how shall I explain it?--which is no more  superiority than the coat is the man, but without which the  highest talent in the world will never be admitted within those  portals.  I know you well enough to be quite sure I indulge no illusion when  I imagine that I see you as I wish you to be; simple in manners,  gentle in tone, proud without conceit, respectful to the old,  courteous without servility, above all, discreet. Use your wit but  never display it for the amusement of others; for be sure that if  your brilliancy annoys an inferior man, he will retire from the  field and say of you in a tone of contempt, ""He is very amusing.""  Let your superiority be leonine. Moreover, do not be always  seeking to please others. I advise a certain coldness in your  relations with men, which may even amount to indifference; this  will not anger others, for all persons esteem those who slight  them; and it will win you the favor of women, who will respect you  for the little consequence that you attach to men. Never remain in  company with those who have lost their reputation, even though  they may not have deserved to do so; for society holds us  responsible for our friendships as well as for our enmities. In  this matter let your judgments be slowly and maturely weighed, but  see that they are irrevocable. When the men whom you have repulsed  justify the repulsion, your esteem and regard will be all the more  sought after; you have inspired the tacit respect which raises a  man among his peers. I behold you now armed with a youth that  pleases, grace which attracts, and wisdom with which to preserve  your conquests. All that I have now told you can be summed up in  two words, two old-fashioned words, ""Noblesse oblige.""  Now apply these precepts to the management of life. You will hear  many persons say that strategy is the chief element of success;  that the best way to press through the crowd is to set some men  against other men and so take their places. That was a good system  for the Middle Ages, when princes had to destroy their rivals by  pitting one against the other; but in these days, all things being  done in open day, I am afraid it would do you ill-service. No, you  must meet your competitors face to face, be they loyal and true  men, or traitorous enemies whose weapons are calumny,  evil-speaking, and fraud. But remember this, you have no more  powerful auxiliaries than these men themselves; they are their own  enemies; fight them with honest weapons, and sooner or later they  are condemned. As to the first of them, loyal men and true, your  straightforwardness will obtain their respect, and the differences  between you once settled (for all things can be settled), these  men will serve you. Do not be afraid of making enemies; woe to him  who has none in the world you are about to enter; but try to give  no handle for ridicule or disparagement. I say _try_, for in Paris a  man cannot always belong solely to himself; he is sometimes at the  mercy of circumstances; you will not always be able to avoid the  mud in the gutter nor the tile that falls from the roof. The moral  world has gutters where persons of no reputation endeavor to  splash the mud in which they live upon men of honor. But you can  always compel respect by showing that you are, under all  circumstances, immovable in your principles. In the conflict of  opinions, in the midst of quarrels and cross-purposes, go straight  to the point, keep resolutely to the question; never fight except  for the essential thing, and put your whole strength into that.  You know how Monsieur de Mortsauf hates Napoleon, how he curses  him and pursues him as justice does a criminal; demanding  punishment day and night for the death of the Duc d\'Enghien, the  only death, the only misfortune, that ever brought the tears to  his eyes; well, he nevertheless admired him as the greatest of  captains, and has often explained to me his strategy. May not the  same tactics be applied to the war of human interests; they would  economize time as heretofore they economized men and space. Think  this over, for as a woman I am liable to be mistaken on such  points which my sex judges only by instinct and sentiment. One  point, however, I may insist on; all trickery, all deception, is  certain to be discovered and to result in doing harm; whereas  every situation presents less danger if a man plants himself  firmly on his own truthfulness. If I may cite my own case, I can  tell you that, obliged as I am by Monsieur de Mortsauf\'s condition  to avoid litigation and to bring to an immediate settlement all  difficulties which arise in the management of Clochegourde, and  which would otherwise cause him an excitement under which his mind  would succumb, I have invariably settled matters promptly by  taking hold of the knot of the difficulty and saying to our  opponents: ""We will either untie it or cut it!""  It will often happen that you do a service to others and find  yourself ill-rewarded; I beg you not to imitate those who complain  of men and declare them to be all ungrateful. That is putting  themselves on a pedestal indeed! and surely it is somewhat silly  to admit their lack of knowledge of the world. But you, I trust,  will not do good as a usurer lends his money; you will do it--will  you not?--for good\'s sake. Noblesse oblige. Nevertheless, do not  bestow such services as to force others to ingratitude, for if you  do, they will become your most implacable enemies; obligations  sometimes lead to despair, like the despair of ruin itself, which  is capable of very desperate efforts. As for yourself, accept as  little as you can from others. Be no man\'s vassal; and bring  yourself out of your own difficulties.  You see, dear friend, I am advising you only on the lesser points  of life. In the world of politics things wear a different aspect;  the rules which are to guide your individual steps give way before  the national interests. If you reach that sphere where great men  revolve you will be, like God himself, the sole arbiter of your  determinations. You will no longer be a man, but law, the living  law; no longer an individual, you are then the Nation incarnate.  But remember this, though you judge, you will yourself be judged;  hereafter you will be summoned before the ages, and you know  history well enough to be fully informed as to what deeds and what  sentiments have led to true grandeur.  I now come to a serious matter, your conduct towards women.  Wherever you visit make it a principle not to fritter yourself  away in a petty round of gallantry. A man of the last century who  had great social success never paid attention to more than one  woman of an evening, choosing the one who seemed the most  neglected. That man, my dear child, controlled his epoch. He  wisely reckoned that by a given time all women would speak well of  him. Many young men waste their most precious possession, namely,  the time necessary to create connections which contribute more  than all else to social success. Your springtime is short,  endeavor to make the most of it. Cultivate influential women.  Influential women are old women; they will teach you the  intermarriages and the secrets of all the families of the great  world; they will show you the cross-roads which will bring you  soonest to your goal. They will be fond of you. The bestowal of  protection is their last form of love--when they are not devout.  They will do you innumerable good services; sing your praises and  make you desirable to society. Avoid young women. Do not think I  say this from personal self-interest. The woman of fifty will do  all for you, the woman of twenty will do nothing; she wants your  whole life while the other asks only a few attentions. Laugh with  the young women, meet them for pastime merely; they are incapable  of serious thought. Young women, dear friend, are selfish, vain,  petty, ignorant of true friendship; they love no one but  themselves; they would sacrifice you to an evening\'s success.  Besides, they all want absolute devotion, and your present  situation requires that devotion be shown to you; two  irreconcilable needs! None of these young women would enter into  your interests; they would think of themselves and not of you;  they would injure you more by their emptiness and frivolity than  they could serve you by their love; they will waste your time  unscrupulously, hinder your advance to fortune, and end by  destroying your future with the best grace possible. If you  complain, the silliest of them will make you think that her glove  is more precious than fortune, and that nothing is so glorious as  to be her slave. They will all tell you that they bestow  happiness, and thus lull you to forget your nobler destiny.  Believe me, the happiness they give is transitory; your great  career will endure. You know not with what perfidious cleverness  they contrive to satisfy their caprices, nor the art with which  they will convert your passing fancy into a love which ought to be  eternal. The day when they abandon you they will tell you that the  words, ""I no longer love you,"" are a full justification of their  conduct, just as the words, ""I love,"" justified their winning you;  they will declare that love is involuntary and not to be coerced.  Absurd! Believe me, dear, true love is eternal, infinite, always  like unto itself; it is equable, pure, without violent  demonstration; white hair often covers the head but the heart that  holds it is ever young. No such love is found among the women of  the world; all are playing comedy; this one will interest you by  her misfortunes; she seems the gentlest and least exacting of her  sex, but when once she is necessary to you, you will feel the  tyranny of weakness and will do her will; you may wish to be a  diplomat, to go and come, and study men and interests,--no, you  must stay in Paris, or at her country-place, sewn to her  petticoat, and the more devotion you show the more ungrateful and  exacting she will be. Another will attract you by her  submissiveness; she will be your attendant, follow you  romantically about, compromise herself to keep you, and be the  millstone about your neck. You will drown yourself some day, but  the woman will come to the surface.  The least manoeuvring of these women of the world have many nets.  The silliest triumph because too foolish to excite distrust. The  one to be feared least may be the woman of gallantry whom you love  without exactly knowing why; she will leave you for no motive and  go back to you out of vanity. All these women will injure you,  either in the present or the future. Every young woman who enters  society and lives a life of pleasure and of gratified vanity is  semi-corrupt and will corrupt you. Among them you will not find  the chaste and tranquil being in whom you may forever reign. Ah!  she who loves you will love solitude; the festivals of her heart  will be your glances; she will live upon your words. May she be  all the world to you, for you will be all in all to her. Love her  well; give her neither griefs nor rivals; do not rouse her  jealousy. To be loved, dear, to be comprehended, is the greatest  of all joys; I pray that you may taste it! But run no risk of  injuring the flower of your soul; be sure, be very sure of the  heart in which you place your affections. That woman will never be  her own self; she will never think of herself, but of you. She  will never oppose you, she will have no interests of her own; for  you she will see a danger where you can see none and where she  would be oblivious of her own. If she suffers it will be in  silence; she will have no personal vanity, but deep reverence for  whatever in her has won your love. Respond to such a love by  surpassing it. If you are fortunate enough to find that which I,  your poor friend, must ever be without, I mean a love mutually  inspired, mutually felt, remember that in a valley lives a mother  whose heart is so filled with the feelings you have put there that  you can never sound its depths. Yes, I bear you an affection which  you will never know to its full extent; before it could show  itself for what it is you would have to lose your mind and  intellect, and then you would be unable to comprehend the length  and breadth of my devotion.  Shall I be misunderstood in bidding you avoid young women (all  more or less artful, satirical, vain, frivolous, and extravagant)  and attach yourself to influential women, to those imposing  dowagers full of excellent good-sense, like my aunt, who will help  your career, defend you from attacks, and say for you the things  that you cannot say for yourself? Am I not, on the contrary,  generous in bidding you reserve your love for the coming angel  with the guileless heart? If the motto Noblesse oblige sums up the  advice I gave you just now, my further advice on your relations to  women is based upon that other motto of chivalry, ""Serve all, love  one!""  Your educational knowledge is immense; your heart, saved by early  suffering, is without a stain; all is noble, all is well with you.  Now, Felix, WILL! Your future lies in that one word, that word of  great men. My child, you will obey your Henriette, will you not?  You will permit her to tell you from time to time the thoughts  that are in her mind of you and of your relations to the world? I  have an eye in my soul which sees the future for you as for my  children; suffer me to use that faculty for your benefit; it is a  faculty, a mysterious gift bestowed by my lonely life; far from  its growing weaker, I find it strengthened and exalted by solitude  and silence.  I ask you in return to bestow a happiness on me; I desire to see  you becoming more and more important among men, without one single  success that shall bring a line of shame upon my brow; I desire  that you may quickly bring your fortunes to the level of your  noble name, and be able to tell me I have contributed to your  advancement by something better than a wish. This secret  co-operation in your future is the only pleasure I can allow  myself. For it, I will wait and hope.  I do not say farewell. We are separated; you cannot put my hand to  your lips, but you must surely know the place you hold in the  heart of yourHenriette.As I read this letter I felt the maternal heart beating beneath myfingers which held the paper while I was still cold from the harshgreeting of my own mother. I understood why the countess had forbiddenme to open it in Touraine; no doubt she feared that I would fall at herfeet and wet them with my tears.I now made the acquaintance of my brother Charles, who up to thistime had been a stranger to me. But in all our intercourse he showeda haughtiness which kept us apart and prevented brotherly affection.Kindly feelings depend on similarity of soul, and there was no point oftouch between us. He preached to me dogmatically those social trifleswhich head or heart can see without instruction; he seemed to mistrustme. If I had not had the inward support of my great love he would havemade me awkward and stupid by affecting to believe that I knew nothingof life. He presented me in society under the expectation that mydulness would be a foil to his qualities. Had I not remembered thesorrows of my childhood I might have taken his protecting vanity forbrotherly affection; but inward solitude produces the same effectsas outward solitude; silence within our souls enables us to hear thefaintest sound; the habit of taking refuge within ourselves developsa perception which discerns every quality of the affections about us.Before I knew Madame de Mortsauf a hard look grieved me, a rough wordwounded me to the heart; I bewailed these things without as yet knowinganything of a life of tenderness; whereas now, since my return fromClochegourde, I could make comparisons which perfected my instinctiveperceptions. All deductions derived only from sufferings endured areincomplete. Happiness has a light to cast. I now allowed myself the morewillingly to be kept under the heel of primogeniture because I was notmy brother\'s dupe.I always went alone to the Duchesse de Lenoncourt\'s, where Henriette\'sname was never mentioned; no one, except the good old duke, who wassimplicity itself, ever spoke of her to me; but by the way he welcomedme I guessed that his daughter had privately commended me to his care.At the moment when I was beginning to overcome the foolish wonder andshyness which besets a young man at his first entrance into the greatworld, and to realize the pleasures it could give through the resourcesit offers to ambition, just, too, as I was beginning to make use ofHenriette\'s maxims, admiring their wisdom, the events of the 20th ofMarch took place.My brother followed the court to Ghent; I, by Henriette\'s advice (for Ikept up a correspondence with her, active on my side only), went therealso with the Duc de Lenoncourt. The natural kindness of the old duketurned to a hearty and sincere protection as soon as he saw me attached,body and soul, to the Bourbons. He himself presented me to his Majesty.Courtiers are not numerous when misfortunes are rife; but youth isgifted with ingenuous admiration and uncalculating fidelity. The kinghad the faculty of judging men; a devotion which might have passedunobserved in Paris counted for much at Ghent, and I had the happinessof pleasing Louis XVIII.A letter from Madame de Mortsauf to her father, brought with despatchesby an emissary of the Vendeens, enclosed a note to me by which I learnedthat Jacques was ill. Monsieur de Mortsauf, in despair at his son\'sill-health, and also at the news of a second emigration, added a fewwords which enabled me to guess the situation of my dear one. Worried byhim, no doubt, when she passed all her time at Jacques\' bedside, allowedno rest either day or night, superior to annoyance, yet unable always tocontrol herself when her whole soul was given to the care of her child,Henriette needed the support of a friendship which might lighten theburden of her life, were it only by diverting her husband\'s mind. ThoughI was now most impatient to rival the career of my brother, who hadlately been sent to the Congress of Vienna, and was anxious at any riskto justify Henriette\'s appeal and become a man myself, freed from allvassalage, nevertheless my ambition, my desire for independence, thegreat interest I had in not leaving the king, all were of no accountbefore the vision of Madame de Mortsauf\'s sad face. I resolved to leavethe court at Ghent and serve my true sovereign. God rewarded me. Theemissary sent by the Vendeens was unable to return. The king wanted amessenger who would faithfully carry back his instructions. The Duc deLenoncourt knew that the king would never forget the man who undertookso perilous an enterprise; he asked for the mission without consultingme, and I gladly accepted it, happy indeed to be able to return toClochegourde employed in the good cause.After an audience with the king I returned to France, where, both inParis and in Vendee, I was fortunate enough to carry out his Majesty\'sinstructions. Towards the end of May, being tracked by the Bonapartistauthorities to whom I was denounced, I was obliged to fly from place toplace in the character of a man endeavoring to get back to his estate.I went on foot from park to park, from wood to wood, across the wholeof upper Vendee, the Bocage and Poitou, changing my direction as dangerthreatened.I reached Saumur, from Saumur I went to Chinon, and from Chinon Ireached, in a single night, the woods of Nueil, where I met the count onhorseback; he took me up behind him and we reached Clochegourde withoutpassing any one who recognized me.""Jacques is better,"" were the first words he said to me.I explained to him my position of diplomatic postman, hunted like a wildbeast, and the brave gentleman in his quality of royalist claimed thedanger over Chessel of receiving me. As we came in sight of Clochegourdethe past eight months rolled away like a dream. When we entered thesalon the count said: ""Guess whom I bring you?--Felix!""""Is it possible!"" she said, with pendant arms and a bewildered face.I showed myself and we both remained motionless; she in her armchair, Ion the threshold of the door; looking at each other with that hungerof the soul which endeavors to make up in a single glance for the lostmonths. Then, recovering from a surprise which left her heart unveiled,she rose and I went up to her.""I have prayed for your safety,"" she said, giving me her hand to kiss.She asked news of her father; then she guessed my weariness and wentto prepare my room, while the count gave me something to eat, for I wasdying of hunger. My room was the one above hers, her aunt\'s room; sherequested the count to take me there, after setting her foot on thefirst step of the staircase, deliberating no doubt whether to accompanyme; I turned my head, she blushed, bade me sleep well, and went away.When I came down to dinner I heard for the first time of the disastersat Waterloo, the flight of Napoleon, the march of the Allies to Paris,and the probable return of the Bourbons. These events were all in all tothe count; to us they were nothing. What think you was the great eventI was to learn, after kissing the children?--for I will not dwell on thealarm I felt at seeing the countess pale and shrunken; I knew the injuryI might do by showing it and was careful to express only joy at seeingher. But the great event for us was told in the words, ""You shall haveice to-day!"" She had often fretted the year before that the water wasnot cold enough for me, who, never drinking anything else, liked iticed. God knows how many entreaties it had cost her to get an ice-housebuilt. You know better than any one that a word, a look, an inflectionof the voice, a trifling attention, suffices for love; love\'s noblestprivilege is to prove itself by love. Well, her words, her look, herpleasure, showed me her feelings, as I had formerly shown her mine bythat first game of backgammon. These ingenuous proofs of her affectionwere many; on the seventh day after my arrival she recovered herfreshness, she sparkled with health and youth and happiness; my lilyexpanded in beauty just as the treasures of my heart increased. Only inpetty minds or in common hearts can absence lessen love or efface thefeatures or diminish the beauty of our dear one. To ardent imaginations,to all beings through whose veins enthusiasm passes like a crimson tide,and in whom passion takes the form of constancy, absence has the sameeffect as the sufferings of the early Christians, which strengthenedtheir faith and made God visible to them. In hearts that abound in loveare there not incessant longings for a desired object, to which theglowing fire of our dreams gives higher value and a deeper tint? Arewe not conscious of instigations which give to the beloved features thebeauty of the ideal by inspiring them with thought? The past, dwelt onin all its details becomes magnified; the future teems with hope. Whentwo hearts filled with these electric clouds meet each other, theirinterview is like the welcome storm which revives the earth andstimulates it with the swift lightnings of the thunderbolt. How manytender pleasures came to me when I found these thoughts and thesesensations reciprocal! With what glad eyes I followed the developmentof happiness in Henriette! A woman who renews her life from that of herbeloved gives, perhaps, a greater proof of feeling than she who dieskilled by a doubt, withered on her stock for want of sap; I know notwhich of the two is the more touching.The revival of Madame de Mortsauf was wholly natural, like the effectsof the month of May upon the meadows, or those of the sun and of thebrook upon the drooping flowers. Henriette, like our dear valley oflove, had had her winter; she revived like the valley in the springtime.Before dinner we went down to the beloved terrace. There, with one handstroking the head of her son, who walked feebly beside her, silent, asthough he were breeding an illness, she told me of her nights beside hispillow.For three months, she said, she had lived wholly within herself,inhabiting, as it were, a dark palace; afraid to enter sumptuous roomswhere the light shone, where festivals were given, to her denied, at thedoor of which she stood, one glance turned upon her child, another toa dim and distant figure; one ear listening for moans, another for avoice. She told me poems, born of solitude, such as no poet eversang; but all ingenuously, without one vestige of love, one trace ofvoluptuous thought, one echo of a poesy orientally soothing as the roseof Frangistan. When the count joined us she continued in the same tone,like a woman secure within herself, able to look proudly at her husbandand kiss the forehead of her son without a blush. She had prayed much;she had clasped her hands for nights together over her child, refusingto let him die.""I went,"" she said, ""to the gate of the sanctuary and asked his life ofGod.""She had had visions, and she told them to me; but when she said, in thatangelic voice of hers, these exquisite words, ""While I slept my heartwatched,"" the count harshly interrupted her.""That is to say, you were half crazy,"" he cried.She was silent, as deeply hurt as though it were a first wound;forgetting that for thirteen years this man had lost no chance to shoothis arrows into her heart. Like a soaring bird struck on the wing byvulgar shot, she sank into a dull depression; then she roused herself.""How is it, monsieur,"" she said, ""that no word of mine ever finds favorin your sight? Have you no indulgence for my weakness,--no comprehensionof me as a woman?""She stopped short. Already she regretted the murmur, and measured thefuture by the past; how could she expect comprehension? Had she notdrawn upon herself some virulent attack? The blue veins of her templesthrobbed; she shed no tears, but the color of her eyes faded. Then shelooked down, that she might not see her pain reflected on my face, herfeelings guessed, her soul wooed by my soul; above all, not see thesympathy of young love, ready like a faithful dog to spring at thethroat of whoever threatened his mistress, without regard to theassailant\'s strength or quality. At such cruel moments the count\'s airof superiority was supreme. He thought he had triumphed over his wife,and he pursued her with a hail of phrases which repeated the one idea,and were like the blows of an axe which fell with unvarying sound.""Always the same?"" I said, when the count left us to follow the huntsmanwho came to speak to him.""Always,"" answered Jacques.""Always excellent, my son,"" she said, endeavoring to withdraw Monsieurde Mortsauf from the judgment of his children. ""You see only thepresent, you know nothing of the past; therefore you cannot criticiseyour father without doing him injustice. But even if you had the pain ofseeing that your father was to blame, family honor requires you to burysuch secrets in silence.""""How have the changes at the Cassine and the Rhetoriere answered?"" Iasked, to divert her mind from bitter thoughts.""Beyond my expectations,"" she replied. ""As soon as the buildings werefinished we found two excellent farmers ready to hire them; one at fourthousand five hundred francs, taxes paid; the other at five thousand;both leases for fifteen years. We have already planted three thousandyoung trees on the new farms. Manette\'s cousin is delighted to get theRabelaye; Martineau has taken the Baude. All _our_ efforts have beencrowned with success. Clochegourde, without the reserved land whichwe call the home-farm, and without the timber and vineyards, bringsin nineteen thousand francs a year, and the plantations are becomingvaluable. I am battling to let the home-farm to Martineau, the keeper,whose eldest son can now take his place. He offers three thousand francsif Monsieur de Mortsauf will build him a farm-house at the Commanderie.We might then clear the approach to Clochegourde, finish the proposedavenue to the main road, and have only the woodland and the vineyardsto take care of ourselves. If the king returns, _our_ pension will berestored; WE shall consent after clashing a little with _our_ wife\'scommon-sense. Jacques\' fortune will then be permanently secured. Thatresult obtained, I shall leave monsieur to lay by as much as he likesfor Madeleine, though the king will of course dower her, according tocustom. My conscience is easy; I have all but accomplished my task. Andyou?"" she said.I explained to her the mission on which the king had sent me, and showedher how her wise counsel had borne fruit. Was she endowed with secondsight thus to foretell events?""Did I not write it to you?"" she answered. ""For you and for my childrenalone I possess a remarkable faculty, of which I have spoken only to myconfessor, Monsieur de la Berge; he explains it by divine intervention.Often, after deep meditation induced by fears about the health of mychildren, my eyes close to the things of earth and see into anotherregion; if Jacques and Madeleine there appear to me as two luminousfigures they are sure to have good health for a certain period of time;if wrapped in mist they are equally sure to fall ill soon after. Asfor you, I not only see you brilliantly illuminated, but I hear a voicewhich explains to me without words, by some mental communication, whatyou ought to do. Does any law forbid me to use this wonderful gift formy children and for you?"" she asked, falling into a reverie. Then,after a pause, she added, ""Perhaps God wills to take the place of theirfather.""""Let me believe that my obedience is due to none but you,"" I cried.She gave me one of her exquisitely gracious smiles, which so exalted myheart that I should not have felt a death-blow if given at that moment.""As soon as the king returns to Paris, go there; leave Clochegourde,""she said. ""It may be degrading to beg for places and favors, but itwould be ridiculous to be out of the way of receiving them. Greatchanges will soon take place. The king needs capable and trustworthymen; don\'t fail him. It is well for you to enter young into the affairsof the nation and learn your way; for statesmen, like actors, have aroutine business to acquire, which genius does not reveal, it must belearnt. My father heard the Duc de Choiseul say this. Think of me,"" shesaid, after a pause; ""let me enjoy the pleasures of superiority in asoul that is all my own; for are you not my son?""""Your son?"" I said, sullenly.""Yes, my son!"" she cried, mocking me; ""is not that a good place in myheart?""The bell rang for dinner; she took my arm and leaned contentedly uponit.""You have grown,"" she said, as we went up the steps. When we reached theportico she shook my arm a little, as if my looks were importunate;for though her eyes were lowered she knew that I saw only her. Then shesaid, with a charming air of pretended impatience, full of grace andcoquetry, ""Come, why don\'t you look at our dear valley?""She turned, held her white silk sun-shade over our heads and drewJacques closely to her side. The motion of her head as she lookedtowards the Indre, the punt, the meadows, showed me that in my absenceshe had come to many an understanding with those misty horizonsand their vaporous outline. Nature was a mantle which sheltered herthoughts. She now knew what the nightingale was sighing the livelongnight, what the songster of the sedges hymned with his plaintive note.At eight o\'clock that evening I was witness of a scene which touched medeeply, and which I had never yet witnessed, for in my former visits Ihad played backgammon with the count while his wife took the childreninto the dining-room before their bedtime. The bell rang twice, and allthe servants of the household entered the room.""You are now our guest and must submit to convent rule,"" said thecountess, leading me by the hand with that air of innocent gaiety whichdistinguishes women who are naturally pious.The count followed. Masters, children, and servants knelt down, alltaking their regular places. It was Madeleine\'s turn to read theprayers. The dear child said them in her childish voice, the ingenuoustones of which rose clear in the harmonious silence of the country, andgave to the words the candor of holy innocence, the grace of angels.It was the most affecting prayer I ever heard. Nature replied to thechild\'s voice with the myriad murmurs of the coming night, like the lowaccompaniment of an organ lightly touched, Madeleine was on the rightof the countess, Jacques on her left. The graceful curly heads, betweenwhich rose the smooth braids of the mother, and above all three theperfectly white hair and yellow cranium of the father, made a picturewhich repeated, in some sort, the ideas aroused by the melody of theprayer. As if to fulfil all conditions of the unity which marks thesublime, this calm and collected group were bathed in the fading lightof the setting sun; its red tints coloring the room, impelling thesoul--be it poetic or superstitious--to believe that the fires of heavenwere visiting these faithful servants of God as they knelt there withoutdistinction of rank, in the equality which heaven demands. Thinkingback to the days of the patriarchs my mind still further magnified thisscene, so grand in its simplicity.The children said good-night, the servants bowed, the countess wentaway holding a child by each hand, and I returned to the salon with thecount.""We provide you with salvation there, and hell here,"" he said, pointingto the backgammon-board.The countess returned in half an hour, and brought her frame near thetable.""This is for you,"" she said, unrolling the canvas; ""but for the lastthree months it has languished. Between that rose and this heartsease mypoor child was ill.""""Come, come,"" said Monsieur de Mortsauf, ""don\'t talk of that any more.Six--five, emissary of the king!""When alone in my room I hushed my breathing that I might hear herpassing to and fro in hers. She was calm and pure, but I was lashed withmaddening ideas. ""Why should she not be mine?"" I thought; ""perhaps sheis, like me, in this whirlwind of agitation."" At one o\'clock, I wentdown, walking noiselessly, and lay before her door. With my ear pressedto a chink I could hear her equable, gentle breathing, like that of achild. When chilled to the bone I went back to bed and slept tranquillytill morning. I know not what prenatal influence, what nature within me,causes the delight I take in going to the brink of precipices, soundingthe gulf of evil, seeking to know its depths, feeling its icy chill, andretreating in deep emotion. That hour of night passed on the thresholdof her door where I wept with rage,--though she never knew that on themorrow her foot had trod upon my tears and kisses, on her virtue firstdestroyed and then respected, cursed and adored,--that hour, foolish inthe eyes of many, was nevertheless an inspiration of the same mysteriousimpulse which impels the soldier. Many have told me they have playedtheir lives upon it, flinging themselves before a battery to know ifthey could escape the shot, happy in thus galloping into the abyss ofprobabilities, and smoking like Jean Bart upon the gunpowder.The next day I went to gather flowers and made two bouquets. The countadmired them, though generally nothing of the kind appealed to him. Theclever saying of Champcenetz, ""He builds dungeons in Spain,"" seemed tohave been made for him.I spent several days at Clochegourde, going but seldom to Frapesle,where, however, I dined three times. The French army now occupied Tours.Though my presence was health and strength to Madame de Mortsauf, sheimplored me to make my way to Chateauroux, and so round by Issoudun andOrleans to Paris with what haste I could. I tried to resist; butshe commanded me, saying that my guardian angel spoke. I obeyed. Ourfarewell was, this time, dim with tears; she feared the allurements ofthe life I was about to live. Is it not a serious thing to enter themaelstrom of interests, passions, and pleasures which make Paris adangerous ocean for chaste love and purity of conscience? I promised towrite to her every night, relating the events and thoughts of the day,even the most trivial. When I gave the promise she laid her head on myshoulder and said: ""Leave nothing out; everything will interest me.""She gave me letters for the duke and duchess, which I delivered thesecond day after my return.""You are in luck,"" said the duke; ""dine here to-day, and go with me thisevening to the Chateau; your fortune is made. The king spoke of you thismorning, and said, \'He is young, capable, and trustworthy.\' His Majestyadded that he wished he knew whether you were living or dead, and inwhat part of France events had thrown you after you had executed yourmission so ably.""That night I was appointed master of petitions to the council of State,and I also received a private and permanent place in the employmentof Louis XVIII. himself,--a confidential position, not highlydistinguished, but without any risks, a position which put me atthe very heart of the government and has been the source of all mysubsequent prosperity. Madame de Mortsauf had judged rightly. I now owedeverything to her; power and wealth, happiness and knowledge; she guidedand encouraged me, purified my heart, and gave to my will that unityof purpose without which the powers of youth are wasted. Later I hada colleague; we each served six months. We were allowed to supply eachother\'s place if necessary; we had rooms at the Chateau, a carriage,and large allowances for travelling when absent on missions. Strangeposition! We were the secret disciples of a monarch in a policy to whicheven his enemies have since done signal justice; alone with us he gavejudgment on all things, foreign and domestic, yet we had no legitimateinfluence; often we were consulted like Laforet by Moliere, and made tofeel that the hesitations of long experience were confirmed or removedby the vigorous perceptions of youth.In other respects my future was secured in a manner to satisfy ambition.Beside my salary as master of petitions, paid by the budget of thecouncil of State, the king gave me a thousand francs a month from hisprivy purse, and often himself added more to it. Though the king knewwell that no young man of twenty-three could long bear up under thelabors with which he loaded me, my colleague, now a peer of France, wasnot appointed till August, 1817. The choice was a difficult one; ourfunctions demanded so many capabilities that the king was long in comingto a decision. He did me the honor to ask which of the young men amongwhom he was hesitating I should like for an associate. Among them wasone who had been my school-fellow at Lepitre\'s; I did not select him.His Majesty asked why.""The king,"" I replied, ""chooses men who are equally faithful, butwhose capabilities differ. I choose the one whom I think the most able,certain that I shall always be able to get on with him.""My judgment coincided with that of the king, who was pleased with thesacrifice I had made. He said on this occasion, ""You are to be thechief""; and he related these circumstances to my colleague, whobecame, in return for the service I had done him, my good friend. Theconsideration shown to me by the Duc de Lenoncourt set the tone ofthat which I met with in society. To have it said, ""The king takes aninterest in the young man; that young man has a future, the king likeshim,"" would have served me in place of talents; and it now gave to thekindly welcome accorded to youth a certain respect that is only given topower. In the salon of the Duchesse de Lenoncourt and also at the houseof my sister who had just married the Marquis de Listomere, son of theold lady in the Ile St. Louis, I gradually came to know the influentialpersonages of the Faubourg St. Germain.Henriette herself put me at the heart of the circle then called""le Petit Chateau"" by the help of her great-aunt, the Princesse deBlamont-Chauvry, to whom she wrote so warmly in my behalf that theprincess immediately sent for me. I cultivated her and contrived toplease her, and she became, not my protectress but a friend, in whosekindness there was something maternal. The old lady took pains to makeme intimate with her daughter Madame d\'Espard, with the Duchesse deLangeais, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, and the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse,women who held the sceptre of fashion, and who were all the moregracious to me because I made no pretensions and was always ready to beuseful and agreeable to them. My brother Charles, far from avoiding me,now began to lean upon me; but my rapid success roused a secret jealousyin his mind which in after years caused me great vexation. My fatherand mother, surprised by a triumph so unexpected, felt their vanityflattered, and received me at last as a son. But their feeling was tooartificial, I might say false, to let their present treatment have muchinfluence upon a sore heart. Affectations stained with selfishness winlittle sympathy; the heart abhors calculations and profits of all kinds.I wrote regularly to Henriette, who answered by two letters a month.Her spirit hovered over me, her thoughts traversed space and made theatmosphere around me pure. No woman could captivate me. The king noticedmy reserve, and as, in this respect, he belonged to the school of LouisXV., he called me, in jest, Mademoiselle de Vandenesse; but my conductpleased him. I am convinced that the habit of patience I acquired in mychildhood and practised at Clochegourde had much to do in my winning thefavor of the king, who was always most kind to me. He no doubt took afancy to read my letters, for he soon gave up his notion of my lifeas that of a young girl. One day when the duke was on duty, and I waswriting at the king\'s dictation, the latter suddenly remarked, in thatfine, silvery voice of his, to which he could give, when he chose, thebiting tone of epigram:--""So that poor devil of a Mortsauf persists in living?""""Yes,"" replied the duke.""Madame de Mortsauf is an angel, whom I should like to see at my court,""continued the king; ""but if I cannot manage it, my chancellor here,""turning to me, ""may be more fortunate. You are to have six months\'leave; I have decided on giving you the young man we spoke of yesterdayas colleague. Amuse yourself at Clochegourde, friend Cato!"" and helaughed as he had himself wheeled out of the room.I flew like a swallow to Touraine. For the first time I was to showmyself to my beloved, not merely a little less insignificant, butactually in the guise of an elegant young man, whose manners had beenformed in the best salons, his education finished by gracious women; whohad found at last a compensation for all his sufferings, and had put touse the experience given to him by the purest angel to whom heaven hadever committed the care of a child. You know how my mother had equippedme for my three months\' visit at Frapesle. When I reached Clochegourdeafter fulfilling my mission in Vendee, I was dressed like a huntsman;I wore a jacket with white and red buttons, striped trousers, leatherngaiters and shoes. Tramping through underbrush had so injured my clothesthat the count was obliged to lend me linen. On the present occasion,two years\' residence in Paris, constant intercourse with the king, thehabits of a life at ease, my completed growth, a youthful countenance,which derived a lustre from the placidity of the soul withinmagnetically united with the pure soul that beamed on me fromClochegourde,--all these things combined had transformed me. I wasself-possessed without conceit, inwardly pleased to find myself, inspite of my years, at the summit of affairs; above all, I had theconsciousness of being secretly the support and comfort of the dearestwoman on earth, and her unuttered hope. Perhaps I felt a flutter ofvanity as the postilions cracked their whips along the new avenueleading from the main road to Clochegourde and through an iron gate Ihad never seen before, which opened into a circular enclosure recentlyconstructed. I had not written to the countess of my coming, wishing tosurprise her. For this I found myself doubly in fault: first, she wasoverwhelmed with the excitement of a pleasure long desired, butsupposed to be impossible; and secondly, she proved to me that all suchdeliberate surprises are in bad taste.When Henriette saw a young man in him who had hitherto seemed but achild to her, she lowered her eyes with a sort of tragic slowness.She allowed me to take and kiss her hand without betraying her inwardpleasure, which I nevertheless felt in her sensitive shiver. When sheraised her face to look at me again, I saw that she was pale.""Well, you don\'t forget your old friends?"" said Monsieur de Mortsauf,who had neither changed nor aged.The children sprang upon me. I saw them behind the grave face of theAbbe Dominis, Jacques\' tutor.""No,"" I replied, ""and in future I am to have six months\' leave, whichwill always be spent here--Why, what is the matter?"" I said to thecountess, putting my arm round her waist and holding her up in presenceof them all.""Oh, don\'t!"" she said, springing away from me; ""it is nothing.""I read her mind, and answered to its secret thought by saying, ""Am I notallowed to be your faithful slave?""She took my arm, left the count, the children, and the abbe, and ledme to a distance on the lawn, though still within sight of the others;then, when sure that her voice could not be heard by them, she spoke.""Felix, my dear friend,"" she said, ""forgive my fears; I have but onethread by which to guide me in the labyrinth of life, and I dread to seeit broken. Tell me that I am more than ever Henriette to you, that youwill never abandon me, that nothing shall prevail against me, that youwill ever be my devoted friend. I have suddenly had a glimpse into myfuture, and you were not there, as hitherto, your eyes shining and fixedupon me--""""Henriette! idol whose worship is like that of the Divine,--lily, flowerof my life, how is it that you do not know, you who are my conscience,that my being is so fused with yours that my soul is here when my bodyis in Paris? Must I tell you that I have come in seventeen hours, thateach turn of the wheels gathered thoughts and desires in my breast,which burst forth like a tempest when I saw you?""""Yes, tell me! tell me!"" she cried; ""I am so sure of myself that I canhear you without wrong. God does not will my death. He sends you to meas he sends his breath to his creatures; as he pours the rain ofhis clouds upon a parched earth,--tell me! tell me! Do you love mesacredly?""""Sacredly.""""For ever?""""For ever.""""As a virgin Mary, hidden behind her veil, beneath her white crown.""""As a virgin visible.""""As a sister?""""As a sister too dearly loved.""""With chivalry and without hope?""""With chivalry and with hope.""""As if you were still twenty years of age, and wearing that absurd bluecoat?""""Oh better far! I love you thus, and I also love you""--she looked at mewith keen apprehension--""as you loved your aunt.""""I am happy! You dispel my terrors,"" she said, returning towards thefamily, who were surprised at our private conference. ""Be still a childat Clochegourde--for you are one still. It may be your policy to be aman with the king, but here, let me tell you, monsieur, your best policyis to remain a child. As a child you shall be loved. I can resist a man,but to a child I can refuse nothing, nothing! He can ask for nothing Iwill not give him.--Our secrets are all told,"" she said, looking atthe count with a mischievous air, in which her girlish, natural selfreappeared. ""I leave you now; I must go and dress.""Never for three years had I heard her voice so richly happy. For thefirst time I heard those swallow cries, the infantile notes of which Itold you. I had brought Jacques a hunting outfit, and for Madeleine awork-box--which her mother afterwards used. The joy of the two children,delighted to show their presents to each other, seemed to annoy thecount, always dissatisfied when attention was withdrawn from himself. Imade a sign to Madeleine and followed her father, who wanted to talk tome of his ailments.""My poor Felix,"" he said, ""you see how happy and well they all are. I amthe shadow on the picture; all their ills are transferred to me, andI bless God that it is so. Formerly I did not know what was the matterwith me; now I know. The orifice of my stomach is affected; I can digestnothing.""""How do you come to be as wise as the professor of a medical school?""I asked, laughing. ""Is your doctor indiscreet enough to tell you suchthings?""""God forbid I should consult a doctor,"" he cried, showing the aversionmost imaginary invalids feel for the medical profession.I now listened to much crazy talk, in the course of which he made themost absurd confidences,--complained of his wife, of the servants, ofthe children, of life, evidently pleased to repeat his daily speeches toa friend who, not having heard them daily, might be alarmed, and whoat any rate was forced to listen out of politeness. He must have beensatisfied, for I paid him the utmost attention, trying to penetratehis inconceivable nature, and to guess what new tortures he had beeninflicting on his wife, of which she had not written to me. Henriettepresently put an end to the monologue by appearing in the portico. Thecount saw her, shook his head, and said to me: ""You listen to me, Felix;but here no one pities me.""He went away, as if aware of the constraint he imposed on my intercoursewith Henriette, or perhaps from a really chivalrous considerationfor her, knowing he could give her pleasure by leaving us alone. Hischaracter exhibited contradictions that were often inexplicable; he wasjealous, like all weak beings, but his confidence in his wife\'s sanctitywas boundless. It may have been the sufferings of his own self-esteem,wounded by the superiority of that lofty virtue, which made him so eagerto oppose every wish of the poor woman, whom he braved as children bravetheir masters or their mothers.Jacques was taking his lessons, and Madeleine was being dressed; I hadtherefore a whole hour to walk with the countess alone on the terrace.""Dear angel!"" I said, ""the chains are heavier, the sands hotter, thethorns grow apace.""""Hush!"" she said, guessing the thoughts my conversation with the counthad suggested. ""You are here, and all is forgotten! I don\'t suffer; Ihave never suffered.""She made a few light steps as if to shake her dress and give to thebreeze its ruches of snowy tulle, its floating sleeves and freshribbons, the laces of her pelerine, and the flowing curls of hercoiffure a la Sevigne; I saw her for the first time a young girl,--gaywith her natural gaiety, ready to frolic like a child. I knew then themeaning of tears of happiness; I knew the joy a man feels in bringinghappiness to another.""Sweet human flower, wooed by my thought, kissed by my soul, oh mylily!"" I cried, ""untouched, untouchable upon thy stem, white, proud,fragrant, and solitary--""""Enough, enough,"" she said, smiling. ""Speak to me of yourself; tell meeverything.""Then, beneath the swaying arch of quivering leaves, we had a longconversation, filled with interminable parentheses, subjects taken,dropped, and retaken, in which I told her my life and my occupations; Ieven described my apartment in Paris, for she wished to know everything;and (happiness then unappreciated) I had nothing to conceal. Knowingthus my soul and all the details of a daily life full of incessant toil,learning the full extent of my functions, which to any one not sternlyupright offered opportunities for deception and dishonest gains, butwhich I had exercised with such rigid honor that the king, I told her,called me Mademoiselle de Vandenesse, she seized my hand and kissed it,and dropped a tear, a tear of joy, upon it.This sudden transposition of our roles, this homage, coupled with thethought--swiftly expressed but as swiftly comprehended--""Here is themaster I have sought, here is my dream embodied!"" all that there was ofavowal in the action, grand in its humility, where love betrayed itselfin a region forbidden to the senses,--this whirlwind of celestial thingsfell on my heart and crushed it. I felt myself too small; I wished todie at her feet.""Ah!"" I said, ""you surpass us in all things. Can you doubt me?--for youdid doubt me just now, Henriette.""""Not now,"" she answered, looking at me with ineffable tenderness, which,for a moment, veiled the light of her eyes. ""But seeing you so changed,so handsome, I said to myself, \'Our plans for Madeleine will be defeatedby some woman who will guess the treasures in his heart; she will stealour Felix, and destroy all happiness here.\'""""Always Madeleine!"" I replied. ""Is it Madeleine to whom I am faithful?""We fell into a silence which Monsieur de Mortsauf inconvenientlyinterrupted. I was forced to keep up a conversation bristling withdifficulties, in which my honest replies as to the king\'s policy jarredwith the count\'s ideas, and he forced me to explain again and again theking\'s intentions. In spite of all my questions as to his horses, hisagricultural affairs, whether he was satisfied with his five farms,whether he meant to cut the timber of the old avenue, he returned to thesubject of politics with the pestering faculty of an old maid and thepersistency of a child. Minds like his prefer to dash themselves againstthe light; they return again and again and hum about it without evergetting into it, like those big flies which weary our ears as they buzzupon the glass.Henriette was silent. To stop the conversation, in which I fearedmy young blood might take fire, I answered in monosyllables, mostlyacquiescent, avoiding discussion; but Monsieur de Mortsauf had too muchsense not to perceive the meaning of my politeness. Presently he wasangry at being always in the right; he grew refractory, his eyebrows andthe wrinkles of his forehead worked, his yellow eyes blazed, his rufousnose grew redder, as it did on the day I first witnessed an attack ofmadness. Henriette gave me a supplicating look, making me understandthat she could not employ on my behalf an authority to which shehad recourse to protect her children. I at once answered the countseriously, taking up the political question, and managing his peevishspirit with the utmost care.""Poor dear! poor dear!"" she murmured two or three times; the wordsreaching my ear like a gentle breeze. When she could intervene withsuccess she said, interrupting us, ""Let me tell you, gentlemen, that youare very dull company.""Recalled by this conversation to his chivalrous sense of what was due toa woman, the count ceased to talk politics, and as we bored him in ourturn by commonplace matters, he presently left us to continue our walk,declaring that it made his head spin to go round and round on the samepath.My sad conjectures were true. The soft landscape, the warm atmosphere,the cloudless skies, the soothing poetry of this valley, which forfifteen years had calmed the stinging fancies of that diseased mind,were now impotent. At a period of life when the asperities of othermen are softened and their angles smoothed, the disposition of this manbecame more and more aggressive. For the last few months he had takena habit of contradicting for the sake of contradiction, without reason,without even trying to justify his opinions; he insisted on knowing thewhy and the wherefore of everything; grew restless under a delay oran omission; meddled with every item of the household affairs, andcompelled his wife and the servants to render him the most minuteand fatiguing account of all that was done; never allowing them theslightest freedom of action. Formerly he did not lose his temper exceptfor some special reason; now his irritation was constant. Perhaps thecare of his farms, the interests of agriculture, an active out-door lifehad formerly soothed his atrabilious temper by giving it a field for itsuneasiness, and by furnishing employment for his activity. Possibly theloss of such occupation had allowed his malady to prey upon itself; nolonger exercised on matters without, it was showing itself in more fixedideas; the moral being was laying hold of the physical being. He hadlately become his own doctor; he studied medical books, fancied he hadthe diseases he read of, and took the most extraordinary and unheard ofprecautions about his health,--precautions never the same, impossible toforesee, and consequently impossible to satisfy. Sometimes he wanted nonoise; then, when the countess had succeeded in establishing absolutesilence, he would declare he was in a tomb, and blame her for notfinding some medium between incessant noise and the stillness of LaTrappe. Sometimes he affected a perfect indifference for all earthlythings. Then the whole household breathed freely; the children played;family affairs went on without criticism. Suddenly he would cry outlamentably, ""They want to kill me!--My dear,"" he would say to his wife,increasing the injustice of his words by the aggravating tones of hissharp voice, ""if it concerned your children you would know very wellwhat was the matter with them.""He dressed and re-dressed himself incessantly, watching every changeof temperature, and doing nothing without consulting the barometer.Notwithstanding his wife\'s attentions, he found no food to suit him, hisstomach being, he said, impaired, and digestion so painful as to keephim awake all night. In spite of this he ate, drank, digested, andslept, in a manner to satisfy any doctor. His capricious will exhaustedthe patience of the servants, accustomed to the beaten track of domesticservice and unable to conform to the requirements of his conflictingorders. Sometimes he bade them keep all the windows open, declaring thathis health required a current of fresh air; a few days later thefresh air, being too hot or too damp, as the case might be, becameintolerable; then he scolded, quarrelled with the servants, and in orderto justify himself, denied his former orders. This defect of memory, orthis bad faith, call it which you will, always carried the day againsthis wife in the arguments by which she tried to pit him against himself.Life at Clochegourde had become so intolerable that the Abbe Dominis, aman of great learning, took refuge in the study of scientific problems,and withdrew into the shelter of pretended abstraction. The countess hadno longer any hope of hiding the secret of these insane furies withinthe circle of her own home; the servants had witnessed scenes ofexasperation without exciting cause, in which the premature old manpassed the bounds of reason. They were, however, so devoted to thecountess that nothing so far had transpired outside; but she dreadeddaily some public outburst of a frenzy no longer controlled by respectfor opinion.Later I learned the dreadful details of the count\'s treatment of hiswife. Instead of supporting her when the children were ill, he assailedher with dark predictions and made her responsible for all futureillnesses, because she refused to let the children take the crazy doseswhich he prescribed. When she went to walk with them the count wouldpredict a storm in the face of a clear sky; if by chance the predictionproved true, the satisfaction he felt made him quite indifferent toany harm to the children. If one of them was ailing, the count gavehis whole mind to fastening the cause of the illness upon the systemof nursing adopted by his wife, whom he carped at for every triflingdetail, always ending with the cruel words, ""If your children fall illagain you have only yourself to thank for it.""He behaved in the same way in the management of the household, seeingthe worst side of everything, and making himself, as his old coachmansaid, ""the devil\'s own advocate."" The countess arranged that Jacquesand Madeleine should take their meals alone at different hours from thefamily, so as to save them from the count\'s outbursts and draw all thestorms upon herself. In this way the children now saw but little oftheir father. By one of the hallucinations peculiar to selfish persons,the count had not the slightest idea of the misery he caused. In theconfidential communication he made to me on my arrival he particularlydwelt on his goodness to his family. He wielded the flail, beat,bruised, and broke everything about him as a monkey might have done.Then, having half-destroyed his prey, he denied having touched it. I nowunderstood the lines on Henriette\'s forehead,--fine lines, traced as itwere with the edge of a razor, which I had noticed the moment I saw her.There is a pudicity in noble minds which withholds them from speakingof their personal sufferings; proudly they hide the extent of theirwoes from hearts that love them, feeling a merciful joy in doing so.Therefore in spite of my urgency, I did not immediately obtain the truthfrom Henriette. She feared to grieve me; she made brief admissions,and then blushed for them; but I soon perceived myself the increase oftrouble which the count\'s present want of regular occupation had broughtupon the household.""Henriette,"" I said, after I had been there some days, ""don\'t you thinkyou have made a mistake in so arranging the estate that the count has nolonger anything to do?""""Dear,"" she said, smiling, ""my situation is critical enough to take allmy attention; believe me, I have considered all my resources, and theyare now exhausted. It is true that the bickerings are getting worseand worse. As Monsieur de Mortsauf and I are always together, I cannotlessen them by diverting his attention in other directions; in fact thepain would be the same to me in any case. I did think of advising himto start a nursery for silk-worms at Clochegourde, where we have manymulberry-trees, remains of the old industry of Touraine. But I reflectedthat he would still be the same tyrant at home, and I should havemany more annoyances through the enterprise. You will learn, my dearobserver, that in youth a man\'s ill qualities are restrained by society,checked in their swing by the play of passions, subdued under the fearof public opinion; later, a middle-aged man, living in solitude, showshis native defects, which are all the more terrible because so longrepressed. Human weaknesses are essentially base; they allow of neitherpeace nor truce; what you yield to them to-day they exact to-morrow, andalways; they fasten on concessions and compel more of them. Power, onthe other hand, is merciful; it conforms to evidence, it is just and itis peaceable. But the passions born of weakness are implacable. Monsieurde Mortsauf takes an absolute pleasure in getting the better of me; andhe who would deceive no one else, deceives me with delight.""One morning as we left the breakfast table, about a month after myarrival, the countess took me by the arm, darted through an iron gatewhich led into the vineyard, and dragged me hastily among the vines.""He will kill me!"" she cried. ""And I want to live--for my children\'ssake. But oh! not a day\'s respite! Always to walk among thorns! tocome near falling every instant! every instant to have to summon all mystrength to keep my balance! No human being can long endure such strainupon the system. If I were certain of the ground I ought to take, if myresistance could be a settled thing, then my mind might concentrate uponit--but no, every day the attacks change character and leave me withoutdefence; my sorrows are not one, they are manifold. Ah! my friend--""she cried, leaning her head upon my shoulder, and not continuing herconfidence. ""What will become of me? Oh, what shall I do?"" she saidpresently, struggling with thoughts she did not express. ""How can Iresist? He will kill me! No, I will kill myself--but that would bea crime! Escape? yes, but my children! Separate from him? how, afterfifteen years of marriage, how could I ever tell my parents that I willnot live with him? for if my father and mother came here he would becalm, polite, intelligent, judicious. Besides, can married women look tofathers or mothers? Do they not belong body and soul to their husbands?I could live tranquil if not happy--I have found strength in my chastesolitude, I admit it; but if I am deprived of this negative happinessI too shall become insane. My resistance is based on powerful reasonswhich are not personal to myself. It is a crime to give birth to poorcreatures condemned to endless suffering. Yet my position raises seriousquestions, so serious that I dare not decide them alone; I cannot bejudge and party both. To-morrow I will go to Tours and consult my newconfessor, the Abbe Birotteau--for my dear and virtuous Abbe de la Bergeis dead,"" she said, interrupting herself. ""Though he was severe, I missand shall always miss his apostolic power. His successor is an angel ofgoodness, who pities but does not reprimand. Still, all courage drawsfresh life from the heart of religion; what soul is not strengthened bythe voice of the Holy Spirit? My God,"" she said, drying her tearsand raising her eyes to heaven, ""for what sin am I thus punished?--Ibelieve, yes, Felix, I believe it, we must pass through a fiery furnacebefore we reach the saints, the just made perfect of the upper spheres.Must I keep silence? Am I forbidden, oh, my God, to cry to the heart ofa friend? Do I love him too well?"" She pressed me to her heart as thoughshe feared to lose me. ""Who will solve my doubts? My conscience does notreproach me. The stars shine from above on men; may not the soul, thehuman star, shed its light upon a friend, if we go to him with purethoughts?""I listened to this dreadful cry in silence, holding her moist handin mine that was still more moist. I pressed it with a force to whichHenriette replied with an equal pressure.""Where are you?"" cried the count, who came towards us, bareheaded.Ever since my return he had insisted on sharing our interviews,--eitherbecause he wanted amusement, or feared the countess would tell me hersorrows and complain to me, or because he was jealous of a pleasure hedid not share.""How he follows me!"" she cried, in a tone of despair. ""Let us go intothe orchard, we shall escape him. We can stoop as we run by the hedge,and he will not see us.""We made the hedge a rampart and reached the enclosure, where we weresoon at a good distance from the count in an alley of almond-trees.""Dear Henriette,"" I then said to her, pressing her arm against my heartand stopping to contemplate her in her sorrow, ""you have guided me withtrue knowledge along the perilous ways of the great world; let me inreturn give you some advice which may help you to end this duel withoutwitnesses, in which you must inevitably be worsted, for you are fightingwith unequal weapons. You must not struggle any longer with a madman--""""Hush!"" she said, dashing aside the tears that rolled from her eyes.""Listen to me, dear,"" I continued. ""After a single hour\'s talk with thecount, which I force myself to endure for love of you, my thoughts arebewildered, my head heavy; he makes me doubtful of my own intellect; thesame ideas repeated over and over again seem to burn themselves onmy brain. Well-defined monomanias are not communicated; but when themadness consists in a distorted way of looking at everything, and whenit lurks under all discussions, then it can and does injure the minds ofthose who live with it. Your patience is sublime, but will it not end indisordering you? For your sake, for that of your children, change yoursystem with the count. Your adorable kindness has made him selfish; youhave treated him as a mother treats the child she spoils; but now, ifyou want to live--and you do want it,"" I said, looking at her, ""usethe control you have over him. You know what it is; he loves you andhe fears you; make him fear you more; oppose his erratic will with yourfirm will. Extend your power over him, confine his madness to a moralsphere just as we lock maniacs in a cell.""""Dear child,"" she said, smiling bitterly, ""a woman without a heartmight do it. But I am a mother; I should make a poor jailer. Yes, I cansuffer, but I cannot make others suffer. Never!"" she said, ""never! noteven to obtain some great and honorable result. Besides, I shouldhave to lie in my heart, disguise my voice, lower my head, degrade mygesture--do not ask of me such falsehoods. I can stand between Monsieurde Mortsauf and his children, I willingly receive his blows that theymay not fall on others; I can do all that, and will do it to conciliateconflicting interests, but I can do no more.""""Let me worship thee, O saint, thrice holy!"" I exclaimed, kneeling ather feet and kissing her robe, with which I wiped my tears. ""But if hekills you?"" I cried.She turned pale and said, lifting her eyes to heaven:""God\'s will be done!""""Do you know that the king said to your father, \'So that devil of aMortsauf is still living\'?""""A jest on the lips of the king,"" she said, ""is a crime when repeatedhere.""In spite of our precautions the count had tracked us; he now arrived,bathed in perspiration, and sat down under a walnut-tree where thecountess had stopped to give me that rebuke. I began to talk about thevintage; the count was silent, taking no notice of the dampness underthe tree. After a few insignificant remarks, interspersed with pausesthat were very significant, he complained of nausea and headache; but hespoke gently, and did not appeal to our pity, or describe his sufferingsin his usual exaggerated way. We paid no attention to him. When wereached the house, he said he felt worse and should go to bed; which hedid, quite naturally and with much less complaint than usual. We tookadvantage of the respite and went down to our dear terrace accompaniedby Madeleine.""Let us get that boat and go upon the river,"" said the countess afterwe had made a few turns. ""We might go and look at the fishing which isgoing on to-day.""We went out by the little gate, found the punt, jumped into it andwere presently paddling up the Loire. Like three children amused withtrifles, we looked at the sedges along the banks and the blue and greendragon-flies; the countess wondered perhaps that she was able toenjoy such peaceful pleasures in the midst of her poignant griefs;but Nature\'s calm, indifferent to our struggles, has a magic gift ofconsolation. The tumults of a love full of restrained desires harmonizewith the wash of the water; the flowers that the hand of man has neverwilted are the voice of his secret dreams; the voluptuous swaying of theboat vaguely responds to the thoughts that are floating in his soul.We felt the languid influence of this double poesy. Words, tuned to thediapason of nature, disclosed mysterious graces; looks were impassionedrays sharing the light shed broadcast by the sun on the glowing meadows.The river was a path along which we flew. Our spirit, no longer keptdown by the measured tread of our footsteps, took possession of theuniverse. The abounding joy of a child at liberty, graceful in itsmotions, enticing in its play, is the living expression of two freedsouls, delighting themselves by becoming ideally the wondrous beingdreamed of by Plato and known to all whose youth has been filled witha blessed love. To describe to you that hour, not in its indescribabledetails but in its essence, I must say to you that we loved each otherin all the creations animate and inanimate which surrounded us; we feltwithout us the happiness our own hearts craved; it so penetrated ourbeing that the countess took off her gloves and let her hands float inthe water as if to cool an inward ardor. Her eyes spoke; but her mouth,opening like a rose to the breeze, gave voice to no desire. You know theharmony of deep tones mingling perfectly with high ones? Ever, when Ihear it now, it recalls to me the harmony of our two souls in this onehour, which never came again.""Where do you fish?"" I asked, ""if you can only do so from the banks youown?""""Near Pont-de-Ruan,"" she replied. ""Ah! we now own the river fromPont-de-Ruan to Clochegourde; Monsieur de Mortsauf has lately boughtforty acres of the meadow lands with the savings of two years and thearrearage of his pension. Does that surprise you?""""Surprise me?"" I cried; ""I would that all the valley were yours."" Sheanswered me with a smile. Presently we came below the bridge to a placewhere the Indre widens and where the fishing was going on.""Well, Martineau?"" she said.""Ah, Madame la comtesse, such bad luck! We have fished up from the millthe last three hours, and have taken nothing.""We landed near them to watch the drawing in of the last net, and allthree of us sat down in the shade of a ""bouillard,"" a sort of poplarwith a white bark, which grows on the banks of the Danube and the Loire(probably on those of other large rivers), and sheds, in the springof the year, a white and silky fluff, the covering of its flower. Thecountess had recovered her august serenity; she half regretted theunveiling of her griefs, and mourned that she had cried aloud like Job,instead of weeping like the Magdalen,--a Magdalen without loves, orgalas, or prodigalities, but not without beauty and fragrance. The netcame in at her feet full of fish; tench, barbels, pike, perch, and anenormous carp, which floundered about on the grass.""Madame brings luck!"" exclaimed the keeper.All the laborers opened their eyes as they looked with admiration at thewoman whose fairy wand seemed to have touched the nets. Just then thehuntsman was seen urging his horse over the meadows at a full gallop.Fear took possession of her. Jacques was not with us, and the mother\'sfirst thought, as Virgil so poetically says, is to press her children toher breast when danger threatens.""Jacques! Where is Jacques? What has happened to my boy?""She did not love me! If she had loved me I should have seen upon herface when confronted with my sufferings that expression of a lioness indespair.""Madame la comtesse, Monsieur le comte is worse.""She breathed more freely and started to run towards Clochegourde,followed by me and by Madeleine.""Follow me slowly,"" she said, looking back; ""don\'t let the dear childoverheat herself. You see how it is; Monsieur de Mortsauf took thatwalk in the sun which put him into a perspiration, and sitting under thewalnut-tree may be the cause of a great misfortune.""The words, said in the midst of her agitation, showed plainly thepurity of her soul. The death of the count a misfortune! She reachedClochegourde with great rapidity, passing through a gap in the wall andcrossing the fields. I returned slowly. Henriette\'s words lighted mymind, but as the lightning falls and blasts the gathered harvest. Onthe river I had fancied I was her chosen one; now I felt bitterly thesincerity of her words. The lover who is not everything is nothing. Iloved with the desire of a love that knows what it seeks; which feeds inadvance on coming transports, and is content with the pleasures ofthe soul because it mingles with them others which the future keepsin store. If Henriette loved, it was certain that she knew neither thepleasures of love nor its tumults. She lived by feelings only, like asaint with God. I was the object on which her thoughts fastened asbees swarm upon the branch of a flowering tree. In my mad jealousy Ireproached myself that I had dared nothing, that I had not tightenedthe bonds of a tenderness which seemed to me at that moment more subtilethan real, by the chains of positive possession.The count\'s illness, caused perhaps by a chill under the walnut-tree,became alarming in a few hours. I went to Tours for a famous doctornamed Origet, but was unable to find him until evening. He spent thatnight and the next day at Clochegourde. We had sent the huntsman inquest of leeches, but the doctor, thinking the case urgent, wished tobleed the count immediately, but had brought no lancet with him. Iat once started for Azay in the midst of a storm, roused a surgeon,Monsieur Deslandes, and compelled him to come with the utmost celerityto Clochegourde. Ten minutes later and the count would have died; thebleeding saved him. But in spite of this preliminary success the doctorpredicted an inflammatory fever of the worst kind. The countess wasovercome by the fear that she was the secret cause of this crisis. Twoweak to thank me for my exertions, she merely gave me a few smiles, theequivalent of the kiss she had once laid upon my hand. Fain would I haveseen in those haggard smiles the remorse of illicit love; but no, theywere only the act of contrition of an innocent repentance, painful tosee in one so pure, the expression of admiring tenderness for me whomshe regarded as noble while reproaching herself for an imaginary wrong.Surely she loved as Laura loved Petrarch, and not as Francesca da Riminiloved Paolo,--a terrible discovery for him who had dreamed the union ofthe two loves.The countess half lay, her body bent forwards, her arms hanging, in asoiled armchair in a room that was like the lair of a wild boar. Thenext evening before the doctor departed he said to the countess, who hadsat up the night before, that she must get a nurse, as the illness wouldbe a long one.""A nurse!"" she said; ""no, no! We will take care of him,"" she added,looking at me; ""we owe it to ourselves to save him.""The doctor gave us both an observing look full of astonishment. Thewords were of a nature to make him suspect an atonement. He promisedto come twice a week, left directions for the treatment with MonsieurDeslandes, and pointed out the threatening symptoms that might obligeus to send for him. I asked the countess to let me sit up the alternatenights and then, not without difficulty, I persuaded her to go to bed onthe third night. When the house was still and the count sleeping I hearda groan from Henriette\'s room. My anxiety was so keen that I went toher. She was kneeling before the crucifix bathed in tears. ""My God!"" shecried; ""if this be the cost of a murmur, I will never complain again.""""You have left him!"" she said on seeing me.""I heard you moaning, and I was frightened.""""Oh, I!"" she said; ""I am well.""Wishing to be certain that Monsieur de Mortsauf was asleep she camedown with me; by the light of the lamp we looked at him. The count wasweakened by the loss of blood and was more drowsy than asleep; his handspicked the counterpane and tried to draw it over him.""They say the dying do that,"" she whispered. ""Ah! if he were to die ofthis illness, that I have caused, never will I marry again, I swear it,""she said, stretching her hand over his head with a solemn gesture.""I have done all I could to save him,"" I said.""Oh, you!"" she said, ""you are good; it is I who am guilty.""She stooped to that discolored brow, wiped the perspiration from it andlaid a kiss there solemnly; but I saw, not without joy, that she did itas an expiation.""Blanche, I am thirsty,"" said the count in a feeble voice.""You see he knows me,"" she said giving him to drink.Her accent, her affectionate manner to him seemed to me to take thefeelings that bound us together and immolate them to the sick man.""Henriette,"" I said, ""go and rest, I entreat you.""""No more Henriette,"" she said, interrupting me with imperious haste.""Go to bed if you would not be ill. Your children, _he himself_ wouldorder you to be careful; it is a case where selfishness becomes avirtue.""""Yes,"" she said.She went away, recommending her husband to my care by a gesture whichwould have seemed like approaching delirium if childlike grace had notbeen mingled with the supplicating forces of repentance. But the scenewas terrible, judged by the habitual state of that pure soul; it alarmedme; I feared the exaltation of her conscience. When the doctorcame again, I revealed to him the nature of my pure Henriette\'sself-reproach. This confidence, made discreetly, removed MonsieurOriget\'s suspicions, and enabled him to quiet the distress of that noblesoul by telling her that in any case the count had to pass through thiscrisis, and that as for the nut-tree, his remaining there had done moregood than harm by developing the disease.For fifty-two days the count hovered between life and death. Henrietteand I each watched twenty-six nights. Undoubtedly, Monsieur de Mortsaufowed his life to our nursing and to the careful exactitude with whichwe carried out the orders of Monsieur Origet. Like all philosophicalphysicians, whose sagacious observation of what passes before themjustifies many a doubt of noble actions when they are only theaccomplishment of a duty, this man, while assisting the countess andme in our rivalry of devotion, could not help watching us, withscrutinizing glances, so afraid was he of being deceived in hisadmiration.""In diseases of this nature,"" he said to me at his third visit, ""deathhas a powerful auxiliary in the moral nature when that is seriouslydisturbed, as it is in this case. The doctor, the family, the nurseshold the patient\'s life in their hands; sometimes a single word, a fearexpressed by a gesture, has the effect of poison.""As he spoke Origet studied my face and expression; but he saw in my eyesthe clear look of an honest soul. In fact during the whole course ofthis distressing illness there never passed through my mind a single oneof the involuntary evil thoughts which do sometimes sear the consciencesof the innocent. To those who study nature in its grandeur as awhole all tends to unity through assimilation. The moral world mustundoubtedly be ruled by an analogous principle. In an pure sphere allis pure. The atmosphere of heaven was around my Henriette; it seemed asthough an evil desire must forever part me from her. Thus she not onlystood for happiness, but for virtue; she _was_ virtue. Finding us alwaysequally careful and attentive, the doctor\'s words and manners took atone of respect and even pity; he seemed to say to himself, ""Hereare the real sufferers; they hide their ills, and forget them."" By afortunate change, which, according to our excellent doctor, is commonenough in men who are completely shattered, Monsieur de Mortsaufwas patient, obedient, complained little, and showed surprisingdocility,--he, who when well never did the simplest thing withoutdiscussion. The secret of this submission to medical care, which heformerly so derided, was an innate dread of death; another contradictionin a man of tried courage. This dread may perhaps explain severalother peculiarities in the character which the cruel years of exile haddeveloped.Shall I admit to you, Natalie, and will you believe me? these fifty daysand the month that followed them were the happiest moments of my life.Love, in the celestial spaces of the soul is like a noble river flowingthrough a valley; the rains, the brooks, the torrents hie to it, thetrees fall upon its surface, so do the flowers, the gravel of itsshores, the rocks of the summits; storms and the loitering tribute ofthe crystal streams alike increase it. Yes, when love comes all comes tolove!The first great danger over, the countess and I grew accustomed toillness. In spite of the confusion which the care of the sick entails,the count\'s room, once so untidy, was now clean and inviting. Soonwe were like two beings flung upon a desert island, for not only doanxieties isolate, but they brush aside as petty the conventions of theworld. The welfare of the sick man obliged us to have points of contactwhich no other circumstances would have authorized. Many a time ourhands, shy or timid formerly, met in some service that we rendered tothe count--was I not there to sustain and help my Henriette? Absorbedin a duty comparable to that of a soldier at the pickets, she forgotto eat; then I served her, sometimes on her lap, a hasty meal whichnecessitated a thousand little attentions. We were like children at agrave. She would order me sharply to prepare whatever might ease thesick man\'s suffering; she employed me in a hundred petty ways. Duringthe time when actual danger obscured, as it does during the battle, thesubtile distinctions which characterize the facts of ordinary life,she necessarily laid aside the reserve which all women, even the mostunconventional, preserve in their looks and words and actions before theworld or their own family. At the first chirping of the birds she wouldcome to relieve my watch, wearing a morning garment which revealed tome once more the dazzling treasures that in my folly I had treated as myown. Always dignified, nay imposing, she could still be familiar.Thus it came to pass that we found ourselves unconsciously intimate,half-married as it were. She showed herself nobly confiding, as sure ofme as she was of herself. I was thus taken deeper and deeper into herheart. The countess became once more my Henriette, Henriette constrainedto love with increasing strength the friend who endeavored to be hersecond soul. Her hand unresistingly met mine at the least solicitation;my eyes were permitted to follow with delight the lines of her beautyduring the long hours when we listened to the count\'s breathing, withoutdriving her from their sight. The meagre pleasures which we allowedourselves--sympathizing looks, words spoken in whispers not to wakethe count, hopes and fears repeated and again repeated, in short, thethousand incidents of the fusion of two hearts long separated--standout in bright array upon the sombre background of the actual scene. Oursouls knew each other to their depths under this test, which many a warmaffection is unable to bear, finding life too heavy or too flimsy in theclose bonds of hourly intercourse.You know what disturbance follows the illness of a master; how theaffairs of life seem to come to a standstill. Though the real care ofthe family and estate fell upon Madame de Mortsauf, the count was usefulin his way; he talked with the farmers, transacted business with hisbailiff, and received the rents; if she was the soul, he was the body.I now made myself her steward so that she could nurse the count withoutneglecting the property. She accepted this as a matter of course, infact without thanking me. It was another sweet communion to share herfamily cares, to transmit her orders. In the evenings we often met inher room to discuss these interests and those of her children. Suchconversations gave one semblance the more to our transitory marriage.With what delight she encouraged me to take a husband\'s place, giving mehis seat at table, sending me to talk with the bailiff,--all in perfectinnocence, yet not without that inward pleasure the most virtuous womanin the world will feel when she finds a course where strict obedience toduty and the satisfaction of her wishes are combined.Nullified, as it were, by illness, the count no longer oppressed hiswife or his household, the countess then became her natural self; shebusied herself with my affairs and showed me a thousand kindnesses. Withwhat joy I discovered in her mind a thought, vaguely conceived perhaps,but exquisitely expressed, namely, to show me the full value of herperson and her qualities and make me see the change that would come overher if she lived understood. This flower, kept in the cold atmosphereof such a home, opened to my gaze, and to mine only; she took as muchdelight in letting me comprehend her as I felt in studying her with thesearching eyes of love. She proved to me in all the trifling thingsof daily life how much I was in her thoughts. When, after my turn ofwatching, I went to bed and slept late, Henriette would keep the houseabsolutely silent near me; Jacques and Madeleine played elsewhere,though never ordered to do so; she invented excuses to serve mybreakfast herself--ah, with what sparkling pleasure in her movements,what swallow-like rapidity, what lynx-eyed perception! and then! whatcarnation on her cheeks, what quiverings in her voice!Can such expansions of the soul be described in words?Often she was wearied out; but if, at such moments of lassitude mywelfare came in question, for me, as for her children, she found freshstrength and sprang up eagerly and joyfully. How she loved to shed hertenderness like sunbeams in the air! Ah, Natalie, some women sharethe privileges of angels here below; they diffuse that light whichSaint-Martin, the mysterious philosopher, declared to be intelligent,melodious, and perfumed. Sure of my discretion, Henriette took pleasurein raising the curtain which hid the future and in showing me two womenin her,--the woman bound hand and foot who had won me in spite of herseverity, and the woman freed, whose sweetness should make my loveeternal! What a difference. Madame de Mortsauf was the skylark ofBengal, transported to our cold Europe, mournful on its perch, silentand dying in the cage of a naturalist; Henriette was the singing bird oforiental poems in groves beside the Ganges, flying from branch to branchlike a living jewel amid the roses of a volkameria that ever blooms. Herbeauty grew more beautiful, her mind recovered strength. The continualsparkle of this happiness was a secret between ourselves, for shedreaded the eye of the Abbe Dominis, the representative of the world;she masked her contentment with playfulness, and covered the proofs ofher tenderness with the banner of gratitude.""We have put your friendship to a severe test, Felix; we may give youthe same rights we give to Jacques, may we not, Monsieur l\'abbe?"" shesaid one day.The stern abbe answered with the smile of a man who can read the humanheart and see its purity; for the countess he always showed the respectmingled with adoration which the angels inspire. Twice during thosefifty days the countess passed beyond the limits in which we held ouraffection. But even these infringements were shrouded in a veil, neverlifted until the final hour when avowal came. One morning, during thefirst days of the count\'s illness, when she repented her harsh treatmentin withdrawing the innocent privileges she had formerly granted me, Iwas expecting her to relieve my watch. Much fatigued, I fell asleep, myhead against the wall. I wakened suddenly at the touch of somethingcool upon my forehead which gave me a sensation as if a rose had restedthere. I opened my eyes and saw the countess, standing a few stepsdistant, who said, ""I have just come."" I rose to leave the room, but asI bade her good-bye I took her hand; it was moist and trembling.""Are you ill?"" I said.""Why do you ask that question?"" she replied.I looked at her blushing and confused. ""I was dreaming,"" I replied.Another time, when Monsieur Origet had announced positively that thecount was convalescent, I was lying with Jacques and Madeleine on thestep of the portico intent on a game of spillikins which we were playingwith bits of straw and hooks made of pins; Monsieur de Mortsauf wasasleep. The doctor, while waiting for his horse to be harnessed, wastalking with the countess in the salon. Monsieur Origet went awaywithout my noticing his departure. After he left, Henriette leanedagainst the window, from which she watched us for some time withoutour seeing her. It was one of those warm evenings when the sky iscopper-colored and the earth sends up among the echoes a myriad minglingnoises. A last ray of sunlight was leaving the roofs, the flowers inthe garden perfumed the air, the bells of the cattle returning to theirstalls sounded in the distance. We were all conforming to the silenceof the evening hour and hushing our voices that we might not wakethe count. Suddenly, I heard the guttural sound of a sob violentlysuppressed; I rushed into the salon and found the countess sitting bythe window with her handkerchief to her face. She heard my step and mademe an imperious gesture, commanding me to leave her. I went up to her,my heart stabbed with fear, and tried to take her handkerchief away byforce. Her face was bathed in tears and she fled into her room, whichshe did not leave again until the hour for evening prayer. When that wasover, I led her to the terrace and asked the cause of her emotion; sheaffected a wild gaiety and explained it by the news Monsieur Origet hadgiven her.""Henriette, Henriette, you knew that news when I saw you weeping.Between you and me a lie is monstrous. Why did you forbid me to dry yourtears? were they mine?""""I was thinking,"" she said, ""that for me this illness has been a haltin pain. Now that I no longer fear for Monsieur de Mortsauf I fear formyself.""She was right. The count\'s recovery was soon attested by the return ofhis fantastic humor. He began by saying that neither the countess, norI, nor the doctor had known how to take care of him; we were ignorantof his constitution and also of his disease; we misunderstood hissufferings and the necessary remedies. Origet, infatuated with his owndoctrines, had mistaken the case, he ought to have attended only tothe pylorus. One day he looked at us maliciously, with an air of havingguessed our thoughts, and said to his wife with a smile, ""Now, my dear,if I had died you would have regretted me, no doubt, but pray admit youwould have been quite resigned.""""Yes, I should have mourned you in pink and black, court mourning,"" sheanswered laughing, to change the tone of his remarks.But it was chiefly about his food, which the doctor insisted onregulating, that scenes of violence and wrangling now took place, unlikeany that had hitherto occurred; for the character of the count was allthe more violent for having slumbered. The countess, fortified by thedoctor\'s orders and the obedience of her servants, stimulated too byme, who thought this struggle a good means to teach her to exerciseauthority over the count, held out against his violence. She showeda calm front to his demented cries, and even grew accustomed to hisinsulting epithets, taking him for what he was, a child. I had thehappiness of at last seeing her take the reins in hand and govern thatunsound mind. The count cried out, but he obeyed; and he obeyed all thebetter when he had made an outcry. But in spite of the evidence of goodresults, Henriette often wept at the spectacle of this emaciated, feebleold man, with a forehead yellower than the falling leaves, his eyes wan,his hands trembling. She blamed herself for too much severity, and couldnot resist the joy she saw in his eyes when, in measuring out his food,she gave him more than the doctor allowed. She was even more gentle andgracious to him than she had been to me; but there were differenceshere which filled my heart with joy. She was not unwearying, and shesometimes called her servants to wait upon the count when his capriceschanged too rapidly, and he complained of not being understood.The countess wished to return thanks to God for the count\'s recovery;she directed a mass to be said, and asked if I would take her to church.I did so, but I left her at the door, and went to see Monsieur andMadame Chessel. On my return she reproached me.""Henriette,"" I said, ""I cannot be false. I will throw myself into thewater to save my enemy from drowning, and give him my coat to keep himwarm; I will forgive him, but I cannot forget the wrong.""She was silent, but she pressed my arm.""You are an angel, and you were sincere in your thanksgiving,"" I said,continuing. ""The mother of the Prince of the Peace was saved from thehands of an angry populace who sought to kill her, and when the queenasked, \'What did you do?\' she answered, \'I prayed for them.\' Women areever thus. I am a man, and necessarily imperfect.""""Don\'t calumniate yourself,"" she said, shaking my arm, ""perhaps you aremore worthy than I.""""Yes,"" I replied, ""for I would give eternity for a day of happiness, andyou--""""I!"" she said haughtily.I was silent and lowered my eyes to escape the lightning of hers.""There is many an I in me,"" she said. ""Of which do you speak? Thosechildren,"" pointing to Jacques and Madeleine, ""are one--Felix,"" shecried in a heartrending voice, ""do you think me selfish? Ought I tosacrifice eternity to reward him who devotes to me his life? The thoughtis dreadful; it wounds every sentiment of religion. Could a woman sofallen rise again? Would her happiness absolve her? These are questionsyou force me to consider.--Yes, I betray at last the secret of myconscience; the thought has traversed my heart; often do I expiate it bypenance; it caused the tears you asked me to account for yesterday--""""Do you not give too great importance to certain things which commonwomen hold at a high price, and--""""Oh!"" she said, interrupting me; ""do you hold them at a lower?""This logic stopped all argument.""Know this,"" she continued. ""I might have the baseness to abandonthat poor old man whose life I am; but, my friend, those other feeblecreatures there before us, Madeleine and Jacques, would remain withtheir father. Do you think, I ask you do you think they would be alivein three months under the insane dominion of that man? If my failure ofduty concerned only myself--"" A noble smile crossed her face. ""But shallI kill my children! My God!"" she exclaimed. ""Why speak of these things?Marry, and let me die!""She said the words in a tone so bitter, so hollow, that they stifled theremonstrances of my passion.""You uttered cries that day beneath the walnut-tree; I have uttered mycries here beneath these alders, that is all,"" I said; ""I will be silenthenceforth.""""Your generosity shames me,"" she said, raising her eyes to heaven.We reached the terrace and found the count sitting in a chair, in thesun. The sight of that sunken face, scarcely brightened by a feeblesmile, extinguished the last flames that came from the ashes. I leanedagainst the balustrade and considered the picture of that poor wreck,between his sickly children and his wife, pale with her vigils, wornout by extreme fatigue, by the fears, perhaps also by the joys of theseterrible months, but whose cheeks now glowed from the emotions she hadjust passed through. At the sight of that suffering family beneath thetrembling leafage through which the gray light of a cloudy autumn skycame dimly, I felt within me a rupture of the bonds which hold the bodyto the spirit. There came upon me then that moral spleen which, theysay, the strongest wrestlers know in the crisis of their combats, aspecies of cold madness which makes a coward of the bravest man, a bigotof an unbeliever, and renders those it grasps indifferent to all things,even to vital sentiments, to honor, to love--for the doubt it bringstakes from us the knowledge of ourselves and disgusts us with lifeitself. Poor, nervous creatures, whom the very richness of yourorganization delivers over to this mysterious, fatal power, who are yourpeers and who your judges? Horrified by the thoughts that rose withinme, and demanding, like the wicked man, ""Where is now thy God?"" I couldnot restrain the tears that rolled down my cheeks.""What is it, dear Felix?"" said Madeleine in her childish voice.Then Henriette put to flight these dark horrors of the mind by a look oftender solicitude which shone into my soul like a sunbeam. Just then theold huntsman brought me a letter from Tours, at sight of which I made asudden cry of surprise, which made Madame de Mortsauf tremble. I saw theking\'s signet and knew it contained my recall. I gave her the letter andshe read it at a glance.""What will become of me?"" she murmured, beholding her desert sunless.We fell into a stupor of thought which oppressed us equally; neverhad we felt more strongly how necessary we were to one another. Thecountess, even when she spoke indifferently of other things, seemed tohave a new voice, as if the instrument had lost some chords and otherswere out of tune. Her movements were apathetic, her eyes without light.I begged her to tell me her thoughts.""Have I any?"" she replied in a dazed way.She drew me into her chamber, made me sit upon the sofa, took a packagefrom the drawer of her dressing-table, and knelt before me, saying:""This hair has fallen from my head during the last year; take it, it isyours; you will some day know how and why.""Slowly I bent to meet her brow, and she did not avoid my lips. I kissedher sacredly, without unworthy passion, without one impure impulse, butsolemnly, with tenderness. Was she willing to make the sacrifice; or didshe merely come, as I did once, to the verge of the precipice? If lovewere leading her to give herself could she have worn that calm, thatholy look; would she have asked, in that pure voice of hers, ""You arenot angry with me, are you?""I left that evening; she wished to accompany me on the road to Frapesle;and we stopped under my walnut-tree. I showed it to her, and told herhow I had first seen her four years earlier from that spot. ""The valleywas so beautiful then!"" I cried.""And now?"" she said quickly.""You are beneath my tree, and the valley is ours!""She bowed her head and that was our farewell; she got into her carriagewith Madeleine, and I into mine alone.On my return to Paris I was absorbed in pressing business which tookall my time and kept me out of society, which for a while forgot me.I corresponded with Madame de Mortsauf, and sent her my journal once aweek. She answered twice a month. It was a life of solitude yet teeming,like those sequestered spots, blooming unknown, which I had sometimesfound in the depths of woods when gathering the flowers for my poems.Oh, you who love! take these obligations on you; accept these dailyduties, like those the Church imposes upon Christians. The rigorousobservances of the Roman faith contain a great idea; they plough thefurrow of duty in the soul by the daily repetition of acts which keepalive the sense of hope and fear. Sentiments flow clearer in furrowedchannels which purify their stream; they refresh the heart, theyfertilize the life from the abundant treasures of a hidden faith, thesource divine in which the single thought of a single love is multipliedindefinitely.My love, an echo of the Middle Ages and of chivalry, was known, I knownot how; possibly the king and the Duc de Lenoncourt had spoken of it.From that upper sphere the romantic yet simple story of a young manpiously adoring a beautiful woman remote from the world, noble in hersolitude, faithful without support to duty, spread, no doubt quickly,through the faubourg St. Germain. In the salons I was the object ofembarrassing notice; for retired life has advantages which ifonce experienced make the burden of a constant social intercourseinsupportable. Certain minds are painfully affected by violentcontrasts, just as eyes accustomed to soft colors are hurt by glaringlight. This was my condition then; you may be surprised at it now, buthave patience; the inconsistencies of the Vandenesse of to-day will beexplained to you.I found society courteous and women most kind. After the marriage of theDuc de Berry the court resumed its former splendor and the glory ofthe French fetes revived. The Allied occupation was over, prosperityreappeared, enjoyments were again possible. Noted personages,illustrious by rank, prominent by fortune, came from all parts of Europeto the capital of the intellect, where the merits and the vices ofother countries were found magnified and whetted by the charms of Frenchintellect.Five months after leaving Clochegourde my good angel wrote me, in themiddle of the winter, a despairing letter, telling me of the seriousillness of her son. He was then out of danger, but there were many fearsfor the future; the doctor said that precautions were necessary forhis lungs--the suggestion of a terrible idea which had put the mother\'sheart in mourning. Hardly had Jacques begun to convalesce, and she couldbreathe again, when Madeleine made them all uneasy. That pretty plant,whose bloom had lately rewarded the mother\'s culture, was now frailand pallid and anemic. The countess, worn-out by Jacques\' long illness,found no courage, she said, to bear this additional blow, and theever present spectacle of these two dear failing creatures made herinsensible to the redoubled torment of her husband\'s temper. Thus thestorms were again raging; tearing up by the roots the hopes that wereplanted deepest in her bosom. She was now at the mercy of the count;weary of the struggle, she allowed him to regain all the ground he hadlost.""When all my strength is employed in caring for my children,"" she wrote,""how is it possible to employ it against Monsieur de Mortsauf; how canI struggle against his aggressions when I am fighting against death?Standing here to-day, alone and much enfeebled, between these two youngimages of mournful fate, I am overpowered with disgust, invincibledisgust for life. What blow can I feel, to what affection can I answer,when I see Jacques motionless on the terrace, scarcely a sign of lifeabout him, except in those dear eyes, large by emaciation, hollow asthose of an old man and, oh, fatal sign, full of precocious intelligencecontrasting with his physical debility. When I look at my prettyMadeleine, once so gay, so caressing, so blooming, now white as death,her very hair and eyes seem to me to have paled; she turns a languishinglook upon me as if bidding me farewell; nothing rouses her, nothingtempts her. In spite of all my efforts I cannot amuse my children; theysmile at me, but their smile is only in answer to my endearments, itdoes not come from them. They weep because they have no strength to playwith me. Suffering has enfeebled their whole being, it has loosened eventhe ties that bound them to me.""Thus you can well believe that Clochegourde is very sad. Monsieur deMortsauf now rules everything--Oh my friend! you, my glory!"" she wrote,farther on, ""you must indeed love me well to love me still; to love mecallous, ungrateful, turned to stone by grief.""']"
85,4,Chapter 4,"['III. THE TWO WOMENIt was at this time, when I was never more deeply moved in my wholebeing, when I lived in that soul to which I strove to send the luminousbreeze of the mornings and the hope of the crimsoned evenings, thatI met, in the salons of the Elysee-Bourbon, one of those illustriousladies who reign as sovereigns in society. Immensely rich, born of afamily whose blood was pure from all misalliance since the Conquest,married to one of the most distinguished old men of the British peerage,it was nevertheless evident that these advantages were mere accessoriesheightening this lady\'s beauty, graces, manners, and wit, all of whichhad a brilliant quality which dazzled before it charmed. She was theidol of the day; reigning the more securely over Parisian societybecause she possessed the quality most necessary to success,--the handof iron in the velvet glove spoken of by Bernadotte.You know the singular characteristics of English people, the distanceand coldness of their own Channel which they put between them andwhoever has not been presented to them in a proper manner. Humanityseems to be an ant-hill on which they tread; they know none of theirspecies except the few they admit into their circle; they ignore eventhe language of the rest; tongues may move and eyes may see in theirpresence but neither sound nor look has reached them; to them, thepeople are as if they were not. The British present an image of theirown island, where law rules everything, where all is automatic inevery station of life, where the exercise of virtue appears to be thenecessary working of a machine which goes by clockwork. Fortificationsof polished steel rise around the Englishwoman behind the golden wiresof her household cage (where the feed-box and the drinking-cup, theperches and the food are exquisite in quality), but they make herirresistibly attractive. No people ever trained married women socarefully to hypocrisy by holding them rigidly between the two extremesof death or social station; for them there is no middle path betweenshame and honor; either the wrong is completed or it does not exist;it is all or nothing,--Hamlet\'s ""To be or not to be."" This alternative,coupled with the scorn to which the customs of her country have trainedher, make an Englishwoman a being apart in the world. She is a helplesscreature, forced to be virtuous yet ready to yield, condemned to livea lie in her heart, yet delightful in outward appearance--for theseEnglish rest everything on appearances. Hence the special charms oftheir women: the enthusiasm for a love which is all their life; theminuteness of their care for their persons; the delicacy of theirpassion, so charmingly rendered in the famous scene of Romeo andJuliet in which, with one stroke, Shakespeare\'s genius depicted hiscountry-women.You, who envy them so many things, what can I tell you that you do notknow of these white sirens, impenetrable apparently but easily fathomed,who believe that love suffices love, and turn enjoyments to satietyby never varying them; whose soul has one note only, their voice onesyllable--an ocean of love in themselves, it is true, and he who hasnever swum there misses part of the poetry of the senses, as he who hasnever seen the sea has lost some strings of his lyre. You know thewhy and wherefore of these words. My relations with the Marchionessof Dudley had a disastrous celebrity. At an age when the senses havedominion over our conduct, and when in my case they had been violentlyrepressed by circumstances, the image of the saint bearing her slowmartyrdom at Clochegourde shone so vividly before my mind that I wasable to resist all seductions. It was the lustre of this fidelity whichattracted Lady Dudley\'s attention. My resistance stimulated her passion.What she chiefly desired, like many Englishwoman, was the spice ofsingularity; she wanted pepper, capsicum, with her heart\'s food, justas Englishmen need condiments to excite their appetite. The dull languorforced into the lives of these women by the constant perfection ofeverything about them, the methodical regularity of their habits, leadsthem to adore the romantic and to welcome difficulty. I was whollyunable to judge of such a character. The more I retreated to a colddistance the more impassioned Lady Dudley became. The struggle, inwhich she gloried, excited the curiosity of several persons, and this initself was a form of happiness which to her mind made ultimate triumphobligatory. Ah! I might have been saved if some good friend hadthen repeated to me her cruel comment on my relations with Madame deMortsauf.""I am wearied to death,"" she said, ""of these turtle-dove sighings.""Without seeking to justify my crime, I ask you to observe, Natalie, thata man has fewer means of resisting a woman than she has of escaping him.Our code of manners forbids the brutality of repressing a woman, whereasrepression with your sex is not only allurement to ours, but is imposedupon you by conventions. With us, on the contrary, some unwritten lawof masculine self-conceit ridicules a man\'s modesty; we leave you themonopoly of that virtue, that you may have the privilege of granting usfavors; but reverse the case, and man succumbs before sarcasm.Though protected by my love, I was not of an age to be wholly insensibleto the triple seductions of pride, devotion, and beauty. When Arabellalaid at my feet the homage of a ball-room where she reigned a queen,when she watched by glance to know if my taste approved of her dress,and when she trembled with pleasure on seeing that she pleased me, I wasaffected by her emotion. Besides, she occupied a social position whereI could not escape her; I could not refuse invitations in the diplomaticcircle; her rank admitted her everywhere, and with the cleverness allwomen display to obtain what pleases them, she often contrived thatthe mistress of the house should place me beside her at dinner. On suchoccasions she spoke in low tones to my ear. ""If I were loved like Madamede Mortsauf,"" she said once, ""I should sacrifice all."" She did submitherself with a laugh in many humble ways; she promised me a discretionequal to any test, and even asked that I would merely suffer her tolove me. ""Your friend always, your mistress when you will,"" she said. Atlast, after an evening when she had made herself so beautiful that shewas certain to have excited my desires, she came to me. The scandalresounded through England, where the aristocracy was horrified likeheaven itself at the fall of its highest angel. Lady Dudley abandonedher place in the British empyrean, gave up her wealth, and endeavored toeclipse by her sacrifices _her_ whose virtue had been the cause of thisgreat disaster. She took delight, like the devil on the pinnacle of thetemple, in showing me all the riches of her passionate kingdom.Read me, I pray you, with indulgence. The matter concerns one of themost interesting problems of human life,--a crisis to which most menare subjected, and which I desire to explain, if only to place a warninglight upon the reef. This beautiful woman, so slender, so fragile, thismilk-white creature, so yielding, so submissive, so gentle, her brow soendearing, the hair that crowns it so fair and fine, this tender woman,whose brilliancy is phosphorescent and fugitive, has, in truth, aniron nature. No horse, no matter how fiery he may be, can conquer hervigorous wrist, or strive against that hand so soft in appearance, butnever tired’]"

86,2,Chapter 2,"['I. THE WAR MEETINGThe Town Hall in Rossville stands on a moderate elevation overlookingthe principal street. It is generally open only when a meeting has beencalled by the Selectmen to transact town business, or occasionally inthe evening when a lecture on temperance or a political address is to bedelivered. Rossville is not large enough to sustain a course of lyceumlectures, and the townspeople are obliged to depend for intellectualnutriment upon such chance occasions as these. The majority of theinhabitants being engaged in agricultural pursuits, the population issomewhat scattered, and the houses, with the exception of a few groupedaround the stores, stand at respectable distances, each encamped on afarm of its own.One Wednesday afternoon, toward the close of September, 1862, a group ofmen and boys might have been seen standing on the steps and in theentry of the Town House. Why they had met will best appear from a largeplacard, which had been posted up on barns and fences and inside thevillage store and postoffice.It ran as follows:     WAR MEETING!The citizens of Rossville are invited to meet at the Town Hall, onWednesday, September 24, at 3 P. M. to decide what measures shall betaken toward raising the town\'s quota of twenty-five men, under therecent call of the President of the United States. All patrioticcitizens, who are in favor of sustaining the free institutionstransmitted to us by our fathers, are urgently invited to be present.The Hon. Solomon Stoddard is expected to address the meeting.Come one, come all.At the appointed hour one hundred and fifty men had assembled in thehall. They stood in groups, discussing the recent call and the generalmanagement of the war with that spirit of independent criticism whichso eminently characterizes the little democracies which make up our NewEngland States.""The whole thing has been mismanaged from the first,"" remarked asapient-looking man with a gaunt, cadaverous face, addressing twolisteners. ""The Administration is corrupt; our generals are eitherincompetent or purposely inefficient. We haven\'t got an officer that canhold a candle to General Lee. Abraham Lincoln has called for six hundredthousand men. What\'ll he do with \'em when he gets \'em? Just nothing atall. They\'ll melt away like snow, and then he\'ll call for more men.Give me a third of six hundred thousand, and I\'ll walk into Richmond inless\'n thirty days.""A quiet smile played over the face of one of the listeners. Witha slight shade of irony in his voice he said, ""If such are yourconvictions, Mr. Holman, I think it a great pity that you are not in theservice. We need those who have clear views of what is required in thepresent emergency. Don\'t you intend to volunteer?""""I!"" exclaimed the other with lofty scorn. ""No, sir; I wash my hands ofthe whole matter. I ain\'t clear about the justice of warring upon ourerring brethren at all. I have no doubt they would be inclined to acceptovertures of peace if accompanied with suitable concessions. Still, ifwar must be waged, I believe I could manage matters infinitely betterthan Lincoln and his cabinet have done.""""Wouldn\'t it be well to give them the benefit of your ideas on thesubject?"" suggested the other quietly.""Ahem!"" said Mr. Holman, a little suspiciously.""What do you mean, Mr. Frost?""""Only this, that if, like you, I had a definite scheme, which I thoughtlikely to terminate the war, I should feel it my duty to communicate itto the proper authorities, that they might take it into consideration.""""It wouldn\'t do any good,"" returned Holman, still a little suspiciousthat he was quietly laughed at. ""They\'re too set in their own ways to bechanged.""At this moment there was a sharp rap on the table, and a voice washeard, saying, ""The meeting will please come to order.""The buzz of voices died away; and all eyes were turned toward thespeaker\'s stand.""It will be necessary to select a chairman to preside over yourdeliberations,"" was next heard. ""Will any one nominate?""""I nominate Doctor Plunkett,"" came from a man in the corner.The motion was seconded, and a show of hands resulted in favor of thenominee.A gentlemanly-looking man with a pleasant face advanced to the speaker\'sstand, and with a bow made a few remarks to this effect:""Fellow citizens: This is new business to me, as you are doubtlessaware. My professional engagements have not often allowed me to takepart in the meetings which from time to time you have held in this hall.On the present occasion, however, I felt it to be my duty, and the dutyof every loyal citizen, to show by his presence how heartily he approvesthe object which has called us together. The same consideration willnot suffer me to decline the unexpected responsibility which you havedevolved upon me. Before proceeding farther, I would suggest that aclerk will be needed to complete the organization.""A young man was nominated and elected without opposition.Doctor Plunkett again addressed the meeting: ""It is hardly necessary,""he said, ""to remind you of the object which has brought us together. Ourforces in the field need replenishing. The Rebellion has assumed moreformidable proportions than we anticipated. It is quite clear that wecannot put it down with one hand. We shall need both. Impressed withthis conviction, President Lincoln has made an extraordinary levy uponthe country. He feels that it is desirable to put down the Rebellionas speedily as possible, and not suffer it to drag through a seriesof years. But he cannot work single-handed. The loyal States must givetheir hearty cooperation. Our State, though inferior in extent andpopulation to some others, has not fallen behind in loyal devotion.Nor, I believe, will Rossville be found wanting in this emergency.Twenty-five men have been called for. How shall we get them? This is thequestion which we are called upon to consider. I had hoped the HonorableSolomon Stoddard would be here to address you; but I regret to learnthat a temporary illness will prevent his doing so. I trust that thosepresent will not be backward in expressing their opinions.""Mr. Holman was already on his feet. His speech consisted of disconnectedremarks on the general conduct of the war, mingled with severedenunciation of the Administration.He had spoken for fifteen minutes in this strain, when the chairmaninterfered----""Your remarks are out of order, Mr. Holman. They are entirely irrelevantto the question.""Holman wiped his cadaverous features with a red silkpocket-handkerchief, and inquired, sarcastically, ""Am I to understandthat freedom of speech is interdicted in this hall?""""Freedom of speech is in order,"" said the chairman calmly, ""providedthe speaker confines himself to the question under discussion. You havespoken fifteen minutes without once touching it.""""I suppose you want me to praise the Administration,"" said Holman,evidently thinking that he had demolished the chairman. He looked aroundto observe what effect his shot had produced.""That would be equally out of order,"" ruled the presiding officer. ""Wehave not assembled to praise or to censure the Administration, but toconsider in what manner we shall go to work to raise our quota.""Holman sat down with the air of a martyr.Mr. Frost rose next. It is unnecessary to report his speech. It wasplain, practical, and to the point. He recommended that the townappropriate a certain sum as bounty money to volunteers. Other towns haddone so, and he thought with good reason. It would undoubtedly draw inrecruits more rapidly.A short, stout, red-faced man, wearing gold spectacles, rose hastily.""Mr. Chairman,"" he commenced, ""I oppose that suggestion. I think itcalculated to work serious mischief. Do our young men need to be hiredto fight for their country? I suppose that is what you call patriotism.For my part, I trust the town will have too much good sense to agree toany such proposition. The consequence of it would be to plunge us intodebt, and increase our taxes to a formidable amount.""It may be remarked that Squire Haynes, the speaker, was the wealthiestman in town, and, of course, would be considerably affected by increasedtaxation. Even now he never paid his annual tax-bill without an inwardgroan, feeling that it was so much deducted from the sum total of hisproperty.Mr. Frost remained standing while Squire Haynes was speaking, and at theclose continued his speech:""Squire Haynes objects that my proposition, if adopted, will makeour taxes heavier. I grant it: but how can we expect to carry on thisgigantic war without personal sacrifices? If they only come in the formof money, we may account ourselves fortunate. I take it for grantedthat there is not a man here present who does not approve the presentwar--who does not feel that we are waging it for good and sufficientreasons.""Here Mr. Holman moved uneasily in his seat, and seemed on the point ofinterrupting the speaker, but for some reason forbore.""Such being the case, we cannot but feel that the burden ought to fallupon the entire community, and not wholly upon any particular portion.The heaviest sacrifices must undoubtedly be made by those who leavetheir homes and peril life and limb on the battlefield. When I proposethat you should lighten that sacrifice so far as it lies in your power,by voting them a bounty, it is because I consider that money willcompensate them for the privations they must encounter and the perilsthey will incur. For that, they must look to the satisfaction that willarise from the feeling that they have responded to their country\'s call,and done something to save from ruin the institutions which our fatherstransmitted as a sacred trust to their descendants. Money cannot pay forloss of life or limb. But some of them leave families behind. It is notright that these families should suffer because the fathers have devotedthemselves to the sacred cause of liberty. When our soldiers go forth,enable them to feel that their wives and children shall not lack for thenecessaries of life. The least that those who are privileged to stay athome can do is to tax their purses for this end.""""Mr. Chairman,"" said Squire Haynes sarcastically, ""I infer that the lastspeaker is intending to enlist.""Mr. Frost\'s face flushed at this insinuation.""Squire Haynes chooses to impute to me interested motives. I need enterinto no defense before an audience to whom I am well known. I willonly inquire whether interested motives have nothing to do with hisopposition to voting bounties to our soldiers?""This was such a palpable hit that Squire Haynes winced under it, and hisred face turned redder as he saw the smiles of those about him.""Impudent puppy!"" he muttered to himself; ""he seems to forget that Ihave a mortgage of eight hundred dollars on his farm. When the timecomes to foreclose it, I will show him no mercy. I\'ll sell him out, rootand branch!""Mr. Frost could not read the thoughts that were passing through the mindof his creditor. They might have given him a feeling of uneasiness, butwould not in the least have influenced his action. He was a man loyal tohis own convictions of duty, and no apprehension of personal loss wouldhave prevented his speaking in accordance with what he felt to be right.The considerations which had been urged were so reasonable that thevoters present, with very little opposition, voted to pay one hundredand fifty dollars to each one who was willing to enlist as one of thetown\'s quota. A list was at once opened, and after the close of themeeting four young men came forward and put down their names, amid theapplause of the assembly.""I wanted to do it before,"" said John Drake, one of the number, to Mr.Frost, ""but I\'ve got a wife and two little children dependent upon mefor support. I couldn\'t possibly support them out of my thirteen dollarsa month, even with the State aid. But your motion has decided me. Icould do better by staying at home, even with that; but that isn\'t thequestion. I want to help my country in this hour of her need; and nowthat my mind is at ease about my family, I shall cheerfully enter theservice.""""And I know of no one who will make a better soldier!"" said Mr. Frostheartily.']"
86,3,Chapter 3,"['II. THE PRIZEA few rods distant from the Town Hall, but on the opposite side of thestreet, stood the Rossville Academy. It had been for some years underthe charge of James Rathburn, A. M., a thorough scholar and a skilfulteacher. A large part of his success was due to his ability in makingthe ordinary lessons of the schoolroom interesting to his scholars.Some forty students attended the academy, mostly from the town ofRossville. Mr. Rathburn, however, received a few boarders into hisfamily.There were three classes in the Latin language; but the majority ofthose who had taken it up stopped short before they had gone beyond theLatin Reader. One class, however, had commenced reading the Aeneid ofVirgil, and was intending to pursue the full course of preparation forcollege; though in regard to one member of the class there was some doubtwhether he would be able to enter college. As this boy is to be our herowe will take a closer look at him.Frank Frost is at this time in his sixteenth year. He is about themedium size, compactly made, and the healthful color in his cheeks isgood evidence that he is not pursuing his studies at the expense of hishealth. He has dark chestnut hair, with a slight wave, and is altogethera fine-looking boy.At a desk behind him sits John Haynes, the son of Squire Haynes,introduced in our last chapter. He is nearly two years older than Frank,and about as opposite to him in personal appearance as can well beimagined. He has a thin face, very black hair is tall of his age, andalready beginning to feel himself a young man. His manner is full ofpretension. He never forgets that his father is the richest man in town,and can afford to give him advantages superior to those possessed by hisschoolfellows. He has a moderate share of ability but is disinclined towork hard. His affectation of Superiority makes him as unpopular amonghis schoolfellows as Frank is popular.These two boys, together with Henry Tufts, constitute the preparatoryclass of Rossville Academy. Henry is mild in his manners, and arespectable student, but possesses no positive character. He comes froma town ten miles distant, and boards with the principal. Frank, thoughthe youngest of the three, excels the other two in scholarship. Butthere is some doubt whether he will be able to go to college. His fatheris in moderate circumstances, deriving a comfortable subsistence from asmall farm, but is able to lay by a very small surplus every year, andthis he feels it necessary to hold in reserve for the liquidation ofthe mortgage held by Squire Haynes. Frank\'s chance of attaining what hecovets-a college education-seems small; but he is resolved at leastto prepare for college, feeling that even this will constitute a veryrespectable education.The reader is introduced to the main schoolroom of the Rossville Academyon the morning of the day of which the war meeting takes place.At nine o\'clock the bell rang, and the scholars took their seats. Afterthe preliminary devotional exercise, Mr. Rathburn, instead of calling upthe first class at once, paused a moment, and spoke as follows:""Scholars, I need not remind you that on the first day of the term,with the design of encouraging you to aim at improvement in Englishcomposition, I offered two prizes-one for the best essay written by aboy over fourteen years of age; the other for the best composition byany one under that age. It gives me pleasure to state that in most ofthose submitted to me I recognize merit, and I should be glad if it werein my power to give three times as many prizes. Those of you, however,who are unsuccessful will feel repaid by the benefit you have yourselvesderived from the efforts you have made for another end.""During this address, John Haynes looked about him with an air ofcomplacency and importance. He felt little doubt that his own essay onthe ""Military Genius of Napoleon"" would win the prize. He did not somuch care for this, except for the credit it would give him. But hisfather, who was ambitious for him, had promised him twenty-fivedollars if he succeeded, and he had already appropriated this sum inimagination. He had determined to invest it in a handsome boat which hehad seen for sale in Boston on his last visit to that city.""After careful consideration,"" continued the teacher, ""I have decidedthat the prize should be adjudged to an essay entitled \'The Duties ofBoys on the Present National Crisis,\' written by Frank Frost.""There was a general clapping of hands at this announcement. Frank wasa general favorite, and even his disappointed rivals felt a degree ofsatisfaction in feeling that he had obtained the prize.There was one exception, however. John Haynes turned pale, and then red,with anger and vexation. He scowled darkly while the rest of the boyswere applauding, and persuaded himself that he was the victim of a greatpiece of injustice.Frank\'s face flushed with pleasure, and his eyes danced with delight. Hehad made a great effort to succeed, and he knew that at home they wouldbe very happy to hear that the prize had been awarded to him.""Frank Frost will come forward,"" said Mr. Rathburn.Frank left his seat, and advanced modestly. Mr. Rathburn placed in hishand a neat edition of Whittier\'s Poem\'s in blue and gold.""Let this serve as an incentive to renewed effort,"" he said.The second prize was awarded to one of the girls. As she has no part inour story, we need say nothing more on this point.At recess, Frank\'s desk was surrounded by his schoolmates, who weredesirous of examining the prize volumes. All expressed hearty good-will,congratulating him on his success, with the exception of John Haynes.""You seem mighty proud of your books, Frank Frost,"" said he with asneer. ""We all know that you\'re old Rathburn\'s favorite. It didn\'t makemuch difference what you wrote, as long as you were sure of the prize.""""For shame, John Haynes!"" exclaimed little Harvey Grover impetuously.""You only say that because you wanted the prize yourself, and you\'redisappointed.""""Disappointed!"" retorted John scornfully. ""I don\'t want any of oldRathburn\'s sixpenny books. I can buy as many as I please. If he\'d given\'em to me, I should have asked him to keep \'em for those who needed \'emmore.""Frank was justly indignant at the unfriendly course which John choseto pursue, but feeling that it proceeded from disappointed rivalry, hewisely said nothing to increase his exasperation. He put the two bookscarefully away in his desk, and settled himself quietly to his day\'slessons.It was not until evening that John and his father met. Both had beenchafed--the first by his disappointment, the second by the failureof his effort to prevent the town\'s voting bounties to volunteers.In particular he was incensed with Mr. Frost, for his imputationof interested motives, although it was only in return for a similarimputation brought against himself.""Well, father, I didn\'t get the prize,"" commenced John, in adiscontented voice.""So much the worse for you,"" said his father coldly. ""You might havegained it if you had made an effort.""""No, I couldn\'t. Rathburn was sure to give it to his favorite.""""And who is his favorite?"" questioned Squire Haynes, not yet siding withhis son.""Frank Frost, to be sure.""""Frank Frost!"" repeated the squire, rapidly wheeling round to his son\'sview of the matter. His dislike of the father was so great that itreadily included the son. ""What makes you think he is the teacher\'sfavorite?""""Oh, Rathburn is always praising him for something or other. All theboys know Frank Frost is his pet. You won\'t catch him praising me, if Iwork ever so hard.""John did not choose to mention that he had not yet tried this method ofsecuring the teacher\'s approval.""Teachers should never have favorites,"" said the squire dogmatically.""It is highly detrimental to a teacher\'s influence, and subversive ofthe principles of justice. Have you got your essay with you, John?""""Yes, sir.""""You may sit down and read it to me, and if I think it deserving, I willtake care that you sha\'n\'t lose by the teacher\'s injustice.""John readily obeyed. He hurried up to his chamber, and, opening hiswriting-desk, took out a sheet of foolscap, three sides of which werewritten over. This he brought down-stairs with him. He began to hopethat he might get the boat after all.The squire, in dressing-gown and slippers, sat in a comfortablearmchair, while John in a consequential manner read his rejectedessay. It was superficial and commonplace, and abundantly marked withpretension, but to the squire\'s warped judgment it seemed to haveremarkable merit.""It does you great credit, John,"" said he emphatically. ""I don\'t knowwhat sort of an essay young Frost wrote, but I venture to say it wasnot as good. If he\'s anything like his father, he is an impertinentjackanapes.""John pricked up his ears, and listened attentively.""He grossly insulted me at the town meeting to-day, and I sha\'n\'t soonforget it. It isn\'t for his interest to insult a man who has the powerto annoy him that I possess.""""Haven\'t you got a mortgage on his farm?""""Yes, and at a proper time I shall remind him of it. But to come back toyour own affairs. What was the prize given to young Frost?""""A blue-and-gold copy of Whittier\'s Poems, in two volumes.""""Plain binding, I suppose.""""Yes, sir.""""Very well. The next time I go to Boston, I will buy you the same thingbound in calf. I don\'t intend that you shall suffer by your teacher\'sinjustice.""""It wasn\'t so much the prize that I cared for,"" said John, who feltlike making the most of his father\'s favorable mood, ""but you know youpromised me twenty-five dollars if I gained it.""""And as you have been defrauded of it, I will give you thirty instead,""said the squire promptly.John\'s eyes sparkled with delight. ""Oh, thank you, sir!"" he said. ""Iwouldn\'t change places with Frank Frost now for all his prize.""""I should think not, indeed,"" said the squire pompously. ""Your positionas the son of a poor farmer wouldn\'t be quite so high as it is now.""As he spoke he glanced complacently at the handsome furniture whichsurrounded him, the choice engravings which hung on the walls, and thefull-length mirror in which his figure was reflected. ""Ten years fromnow Frank Frost will be only a common laborer on his father\'s farm--thatis,"" he added significantly, ""if his father manages to keep it; whileyou, I hope, will be winning distinction at the bar.""Father and son were in a congenial mood that evening, and a commonhatred drew them more closely together than mutual affection had everdone. They were very much alike--both cold, calculating, and selfish.The squire was indeed ambitious for his son, but could hardly be saidto love him, since he was incapable of feeling a hearty love for any oneexcept himself.As for John, it is to be feared that he regarded his father chiefly asone from whom he might expect future favors. His mother had been a good,though not a strong-minded woman, and her influence might have been ofadvantage to her son; but unhappily she had died when John was in histenth year, and since then he had become too much like his father.']"
86,4,Chapter 4,"['III. FRANK AT HOMEMr. Frost\'s farm was situated about three-quarters of a mile from thevillage. It comprised fifty acres, of which twenty were suitable fortillage, the remainder being about equally divided between woodland andpasture.Mr. Frost had for some years before his marriage been a painter, and hadmanaged to save up from his earnings not far from a thousand dollars.Thinking, however, that farming would be more favorable to health, hepurchased his fifty-acre farm for twenty-eight hundred dollars, payableone thousand down, and the rest remaining on mortgage. At the date ofour story he had succeeded in paying up the entire amount within eighthundred dollars, a mortgage for that amount being held by Squire Haynes.He had not been able to accomplish this without strict economy, in whichhis wife had cheerfully aided him.But his family had grown larger and more expensive. Besides Frank, whowas the oldest, there were now three younger children--Alice, twelveyears of age; Maggie, ten; and Charlie, seven.The farmhouse was small but comfortable, and the family had never beentempted to sigh for a more costly or luxurious home. They were happy andcontented, and this made their home attractive.On the evening succeeding that of the war meeting, Frank was seatedin the common sitting-room with his father and mother. There was awell-worn carpet on the floor, a few plain chairs were scattered aboutthe room, and in the corner ticked one of the old-fashioned clocks suchas used to be the pride of our New England households. In the centerof the room stood a round table, on which had been set a largekerosene-lamp, which diffused a cheerful light about the apartment.On a little table, over which hung a small mirror, were several papersand magazines. Economical in most things, Mr. Frost was considered bymany of his neighbors extravagant in this. He subscribed regularlyfor Harper\'s Magazine and Weekly, a weekly agricultural paper, a dailypaper, and a child\'s magazine.""I don\'t see how you can afford to buy so much reading-matter,"" said aneighbor, one day. ""It must cost you a sight of money. As for me, I onlytake a weekly paper, and I think I shall have to give that up soon.""""All my papers and magazines cost me in a year, including postage,is less than twenty dollars,"" said Mr. Frost quietly. ""A very slightadditional economy in dress--say three dollars a year to each of us willpay that. I think my wife would rather make her bonnet wear doubly aslong than give up a single one of our papers. When you think of thecomparative amount of pleasure given by a paper that comes to youfifty-two times in a year, and a little extra extravagance in dress, Ithink you will decide in favor of the paper.""""But when you\'ve read it, you haven\'t anything to show for your money.""""And when clothes are worn out you may say the same of them. But wevalue both for the good they have done, and the pleasure they haveafforded. I have always observed that a family where papers andmagazines are taken is much more intelligent and well informed thanwhere their bodies are clothed at the expense of their minds. Our dailypaper is the heaviest item; but I like to know what is passing in theworld, and, besides, I think I more than defray the expense by theknowledge I obtain of the markets. At what price did you sell yourapples last year?""""At one dollar and seventy-five cents per barrel.""""And I sold forty barrels at two dollars per barrel. I found from mypaper that there was reason to expect an increase in the price, and heldon. By so doing I gained ten dollars, which more than paid the expenseof my paper for the year. So even in a money way I was paid for mysubscription. No, neighbor, though I have good reason to economize, Idon\'t care to economize in that direction. I want my children to grow upintelligent citizens. Let me advise you, instead of stopping your onlypaper, to subscribe for two or three more.""""I don\'t know,"" was the irresolute reply. ""It was pretty lucky about theapples; but it seems a good deal to pay. As for my children, they don\'tget much time to read. They\'ve got to earn their livin\', and that ain\'tdone by settin\' down and readin\'.""""I am not so sure of that,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Education often enables aman to make money.""The reader may have been surprised at the ease with which Mr. Frostexpressed himself in his speech at the war meeting. No other explanationis required than that he was in the habit of reading, every day,well-selected newspapers. ""A man is known by the company he keeps.""""So you gained the prize, Frank?"" said his father approvingly. ""I amvery glad to hear it. It does you great credit. I hope none were enviousof your success.""""Most of the boys seemed glad of it,"" was the reply; ""but John Hayneswas angry because he didn\'t get it himself. He declared that I succeededonly because I was a favorite with Mr. Rathburn.""""I am afraid he has not an amiable disposition. However, we mustremember that his home influences haven\'t been the best. His mother\'sdeath was unfortunate for him.""""I heard at the store that you and Squire Haynes had a discussion at thewar meeting,"" said Frank inquiringly. ""How was it, father?""""It was on the question of voting a bounty to our volunteers. I feltthat such a course would be only just. The squire objected on the groundthat our taxes would be considerably increased.""""And how did the town vote?""""They sustained my proposition, much to the squire\'s indignation. Hedoesn\'t seem to feel that any sacrifices ought to be expected of him.""""What is the prospect of obtaining the men, father?""""Four have already enlisted, but twenty-one are still required. I fearthere will be some difficulty in obtaining the full number. In a farmingtown like ours the young men are apt to go off to other places as soonas they are old enough; so that the lot must fall upon some who havefamilies.""Frank sat for some minutes gazing thoughtfully into the wood-fire thatcrackled in the fireplace.""I wish I was old enough to go, father,"" he said, at length.""I wish you were,"" said his father earnestly. ""Not that it wouldn\'tbe hard to send you out into the midst of perils; but our duty to ourcountry ought to be paramount to our personal preferences.""""There\'s another reason,"" he said, after awhile, ""why I wish you wereolder. You could take my place on the farm, and leave me free to enlist.I should have no hesitation in going. I have not forgotten that mygrandfather fought at Bunker Hill.""""I know, father,"" said Frank, nodding; ""and that\'s his musket that hangsup in your room, isn\'t it?""""Yes; it was his faithful companion for three years. I often think withpride of his services. I have been trying to think all day whetherI couldn\'t make some arrangement to have the farm carried on inmy absence; but it is very hard to obtain a person in whom I couldconfide.""""If I were as good a manager as some,"" said Mrs. Frost, with a smile,""I would offer to be your farmer; but I am afraid that, though myintentions would be the best, things would go on badly under myadministration.""""You have enough to do in the house, Mary,"" said her husband. ""I shouldnot wish you to undertake the additional responsibility, even if youwere thoroughly competent. I am afraid I shall have to give up the ideaof going.""Mr. Frost took up the evening paper. Frank continued to lookthoughtfully into the fire, as if revolving something in his mind.Finally he rose, and lighting a candle went up to bed. But he did notgo to sleep for some time. A plan had occurred to him, and he wasconsidering its feasibility.""I think I could do it,"" he said, at last, turning over and composinghimself to sleep. ""I\'ll speak to father the first thing to-morrowmorning.""']"
86,5,Chapter 5,"['IV. FRANK MAKES A PROPOSITIONWhen Frank woke the next morning the sun was shining into his window.He rubbed his eyes and tried to think what it was that occupied his mindthe night before. It came to him in a moment, and jumping out of bed, hedressed himself with unusual expedition.Hurrying down-stairs, he found his mother in the kitchen, busily engagedin getting breakfast.""Where\'s father?"" he asked.""He hasn\'t come in from the barn yet, Frank,"" his mother answered. ""Youcan have your breakfast now, if you are in a hurry to get to studying.""""Never mind, just now, mother,"" returned Frank. ""I want to speak tofather about something.""Taking his cap from the nail in the entry where it usually hung, Frankwent out to the barn. He found that his father was nearly throughmilking.""Is breakfast ready?"" asked Mr. Frost, looking up. ""Tell your mother sheneedn\'t wait for me.""""It isn\'t ready yet,"" said Frank. ""I came out because I want to speak toyou about something very particular.""""Very well, Frank, Go on.""""But if you don\'t think it a good plan, or think that I am foolish inspeaking of it, don\'t say anything to anybody.""Mr. Frost looked at Frank in some little curiosity.""Perhaps,"" he said, smiling, ""like our neighbor Holman, you have formeda plan for bringing the war to a close.""Frank laughed. ""I am not quite so presumptuous,"" he said. ""You remembersaying last night, that if I were old enough to take charge of the farm,you would have no hesitation in volunteering?""""Yes.""""Don\'t you think I am old enough?"" asked Frank eagerly.""Why, you are only fifteen, Frank,"" returned his father, in surprise.""I know it, but I am strong enough to do considerable work.""""It isn\'t so much that which is required. A man could easily be foundto do the hardest of the work. But somebody is needed who understandsfarming, and is qualified to give directions. How much do you know ofthat?""""Not much at present,"" answered Frank modestly, ""but I think I couldlearn easily. Besides, there\'s Mr. Maynard, who is a good farmer, couldadvise me whenever I was in doubt, and you could write home directionsin your letters.""""That is true,"" said Mr. Frost thoughtfully. ""I will promise to give itcareful consideration. But have you thought that you will be obliged togive up attending school.""""Yes, father.""""And, of course, that will put you back; your class-mates will get inadvance of you.""""I have thought of that, father, and I shall be very sorry for it. But Ithink that is one reason why I desire the plan.""""I don\'t understand you, Frank,"" said his father, a little puzzled.""You see, father, it would require a sacrifice on my part, and I shouldfeel glad to think I had an opportunity of making a sacrifice for thesake of my country.""""That\'s the right spirit, Frank,"" said his father approvingly. ""That\'sthe way my grandfather felt and acted, and it\'s the way I like to see myson feel. So it would be a great sacrifice to me to leave you all.""""And to us to be parted from you, father,"" said Frank.""I have no doubt of it, my dear boy,"" said his father kindly. ""We havealways been a happy and united family, and, please God, we always shallbe. But this plan of yours requires consideration. I will talk it overwith your mother and Mr. Maynard, and will then come to a decision.""""I was afraid you would laugh at me,"" said Frank.""No,"" said his father, ""it was a noble thought, and does you credit. Ishall feel that, whatever course I may think it wisest to adopt.""The sound of a bell from the house reached them. This meant breakfast.Mr. Frost had finished milking, and with a well-filled pail in eitherhand, went toward the house.""Move the milking:-stool, Frank,"" he said, looking behind him, ""or thecow will kick it over.""Five minutes later they were at breakfast.""I have some news for you, Mary,"" said Mr. Frost, as he helped his wifeto a sausage.""Indeed?"" said she, looking up inquiringly.""Some one has offered to take charge of the farm for me, in case I wishto go out as a soldier.""""Who is it?"" asked Mrs. Frost, with strong interest.""A gentleman with whom you are well--I may say intimately acquainted,""was the smiling response.""It isn\'t Mr. Maynard?""""No. It is some one that lives nearer than he.""""How can that be? He is our nearest neighbor.""""Then you can\'t guess?""""No. I am quite mystified.""""Suppose I should say that it is your oldest son?""""What, Frank?"" exclaimed Mrs. Frost, turning from her husband to herson, whose flushed face indicated how anxious he was about his mother\'sfavorable opinion.""You have hit it.""""You were not in earnest, Frank?"" said Mrs. Frost inquiringly.""Ask father.""""I think he was. He certainly appeared to be.""""But what does Frank know about farming?""""I asked him that question myself. He admitted that he didn\'t know muchat present, but thought that, with Mr. Maynard\'s advice, he might getalong.""Mrs. Frost was silent a moment. ""It will be a great undertaking,"" shesaid, at last; ""but if you think you can trust Frank, I will do allI can to help him. I can\'t bear to think of having you go, yet I amconscious that this is a feeling which I have no right to indulge at theexpense of my country.""""Yes,"" said her husband seriously. ""I feel that I owe my country aservice which I have no right to delegate to another, as long as I amable to discharge it myself. I shall reflect seriously upon Frank\'sproposition.""There was no more said at this time. Both Frank and his parents feltthat it was a serious matter, and not to be hastily decided.After breakfast Frank went up-stairs, and before studying his Latinlesson, read over thoughtfully the following passage in his prize essayon ""The Duties of American Boys at the Present Crisis:""""Now that so large a number of our citizens have been withdrawn fromtheir families and their ordinary business to engage in putting downthis Rebellion, it becomes the duty of the boys to take their places asfar as they are able to do so. A boy cannot wholly supply the place of aman, but he can do so in part. And where he is not called on to do this,he can so conduct himself that his friends who are absent may feel atease about him. He ought to feel willing to give up some pleasures, ifby so doing he can help to supply the places of those who are gone.If he does this voluntarily, and in the right spirit, he is just aspatriotic as if he were a soldier in the field.""""I didn\'t think,"" thought Frank, ""when I wrote this, how soon my wordswould come back to me. It isn\'t much to write the words. The thing isto stand by them. If father should decide to go, I will do my best, andthen, when the Rebellion is over, I shall feel that I did something,even if It wasn\'t much, toward putting it down.""Frank put his essay carefully away in a bureau drawer in which he kepthis clothes, and, spreading open his Latin lexicon, proceeded to preparehis lesson in the third book of Virgil\'s Aeneid.']"
86,6,Chapter 6,"['V. MR. RATHBURN MAKES A SPEECHFrank\'s seat in the schoolroom was directly in front of that occupied byJohn Haynes. Until the announcement of the prize John and he had been onfriendly terms. They belonged to the same class in Latin, and Frank hadoften helped his classmate through a difficult passage which he had notthe patience to construe for himself. Now, however, a coolness grew upbetween them, originating with John. He felt envious of Frank\'s success;and this feeling brought with it a certain bitterness which foundgratification in anything which he had reason to suppose would annoyFrank.On the morning succeeding the distribution of the prizes, Frank arrivedat the schoolhouse a few minutes before the bell rang. John, with half adozen other boys, stood near the door.John took off his hat with mock deference. ""Make way for the great prizeessayist, gentlemen!"" he said. ""The modern Macaulay is approaching.""Frank colored with annoyance. John did not fail to notice this withpleasure. He was sorry, however, that none of the other boys seemedinclined to join in the demonstration. In fact, they liked Frank muchthe better of the two.""That isn\'t quite fair, John,"" said Frank, in a low voice.""I am always glad to pay my homage to distinguished talent,"" Johnproceeded, in the same tone. ""I feel how presumptuous I was in venturingto compete with a gentleman of such genius!""""Do you mean to insult me?"" asked Frank, growing angry.""Oh, dear, no! I am only expressing my high opinion of your talents!""""Let him alone, John!"" said Dick Jones, ""It isn\'t his fault that theteacher awarded the prize to him instead of you.""""I hope you don\'t think I care for that!"" said John, snapping hisfingers. ""He\'s welcome to his rubbishing books; they don\'t amount tomuch, anyway. I don\'t believe they cost more than two dollars at themost. If you\'d like to see what I got for my essay, I\'ll show you.""John pulled out his portemonnaie, and unrolled three new and crispbank-notes of ten dollars each.""I think that\'s pretty good pay,"" he said, looking about himtriumphantly. ""I don\'t care how many prizes Rathburn chooses to give hisfavorite. I rather think I can get along without them.""John\'s face was turned toward the door, otherwise he would have observedthe approach of the teacher, and spoken with more caution. But it wastoo late. The words had been spoken above his ordinary voice, and weredistinctly heard by the teacher. He looked sharply at John Haynes, whoseglance fell before his, but without a word passed into the schoolroom.""See if you don\'t get a blowing-up, John,"" said Dick Jones.""What do I care!"" said John, but in a tone too subdued to be heard byany one else. ""It won\'t do Rathburn any harm to hear the truth for oncein his life.""""Well, I\'m glad I\'m not in your place, that\'s all!"" replied Dick.""You\'re easily frightened!"" rejoined John, with a sneer.Nevertheless, as he entered the schoolroom, and walked with assumedbravado to his seat in the back part of the room, he did not feel quiteso comfortable as he strove to appear. As he glanced stealthily at theface of the teacher, who looked unusually stern and grave, he could nothelp thinking, ""I wonder whether he will say anything about it.""Mr. Rathburn commenced in the usual manner; but after the devotionalexercises were over, he paused, and, after a brief silence, during whichthose who had heard John\'s words listened with earnest attention, spokeas follows:""As I approached the schoolroom this morning I chanced to catch somewords which I presume were not intended for my ear. If I rememberrightly they were, \'I don\'t care how many prizes Rathburn gives hisfavorite!\' There were several that heard them, so that I can beeasily corrected if I have made any mistake. Now I will not affectto misunderstand the charge conveyed by these words. I am accused ofassigning the prizes, or at least, one of them, yesterday, not withstrict regard to the merit of the essays presented, but under theinfluence of partiality. If this is the real feeling of the speaker, Ican only say that I am sorry he should have so low an opinion of me.I do not believe the scholars generally entertain any such suspicion.Though I may err in judgment, I think that most of you will not chargeme with anything more serious. If you ask me whether a teacher hasfavorites, I say that he cannot help having them. He cannot help makinga difference between the studious on the one hand, and the indolent andneglectful on the other. But in a matter like this I ask you to believeme when I say that no consideration except that of merit is permitted toweigh. The boy who made this charge is one of my most advanced scholars,and has no reason to believe that he would be treated with unfairness.I do not choose to say any more on this subject, except that I havedecided to offer two similar prizes for the two best compositionssubmitted within the next four weeks. I shall assign them to the best ofmy judgment, without regard to the scholarship of the writer.""Mr. Rathburn spoke in a quiet, dignified manner, which convinced allwho heard him of his fairness. I say all, because even John Haynes waspersuaded against his own will, though he did not choose to acknowledgeit. He had a dogged obstinacy which would not allow him to retract whathe had once said. There was an unpleasant sneer on his face while theteacher was speaking, which he did not attempt to conceal.""The class in Virgil,"" called Mr. Rathburn.This class consisted of Frank Frost, John Haynes, and Henry Tufts. Johnrose slowly from his seat, and advanced to the usual place, taking careto stand as far from Frank as possible.""You may commence, John,"" said the teacher.It was unfortunate for John that he had been occupied, first, bythoughts of his rejected essay, and afterward by thoughts of the boatwhich he proposed to buy with the thirty dollars of which he had becomepossessed, so that he had found very little time to devote to his Latin.Had he been on good terms with Frank, he would have asked him to readover the lesson, which, as he was naturally quick, would have enabledhim to get off passably. But, of course, under the circumstances, thiswas not to be thought of. So he stumbled through two or three sentences,in an embarrassed manner. Mr. Rathburn at first helped him along.Finding, however, that he knew little or nothing of the lesson, hequietly requested Frank to read, saying, ""You don\'t seem so wellprepared as usual, John.""Frank translated fluently and well, his recitation forming a veryfavorable contrast to the slipshod attempt of John. This John, in aspirit of unreasonableness, magnified into a grave offense, and a desireto ""show off"" at his expense.""Trying to shine at my expense,"" he muttered. ""Well, let him! Two orthree years hence, when I am in college, perhaps things may be a littledifferent.""Frank noticed his repellent look, and it made him feel uncomfortable. Hewas a warm-hearted boy, and wanted to be on good terms with everybody.Still, he could not help feeling that in the present instance he hadnothing to reproach himself with.John went back to his seat feeling an increased irritation againstFrank. He could not help seeing that he was more popular with hisschoolmates than himself, and, of course, this, too, he considered ajust cause of offense against him.While he was considering in what way he could slight Frank, the thoughtof the boat he was about to purchase entered his mind. He brightened upat once, for this suggested something. He knew how much boys like goingout upon the water. At present there was no boat on the pond. His wouldhold six or eight boys readily. He would invite some of the oldest boysto accompany him on his first trip, carefully omitting Frank Frost. Theslight would be still more pointed because Frank was his classmate.When the bell rang for recess he lost no time in carrying out the schemehe had thought of.""Dick,"" he called out to Dick Jones, ""I am expecting my boat up fromBoston next Tuesday, and I mean to go out in her Wednesday afternoon.Wouldn\'t you like to go with me?""""With all the pleasure in life,"" said Dick, ""and thank you for theinvitation.""""How many will she hold?""""Eight or ten, I expect. Bob Ingalls, would you like to go, too?""The invitation was eagerly accepted. John next approached Henry Tufts,who was speaking with Frank Frost.Without even looking at the latter, he asked Henry if he would like togo.""Very much,"" was the reply.""Then I will expect you,"" he said. He turned on his heel and walked offwithout taking any notice of Frank.Frank blushed in spite of himself.""Don\'t he mean to invite you?"" asked Henry, in surprise.""It appears not,"" said Frank.""It\'s mean in him, then,"" exclaimed Henry; ""I declare, I\'ve a great mindnot to go.""""I hope you will go,"" said Frank hastily. ""You will enjoy it. Promise meyou will go.""""Would you really prefer to have me?""""I should be very sorry if you didn\'t.""""Then I\'ll go; but I think he\'s mean in not asking you, for all that.""']"
86,7,Chapter 7,"['VI. MR. FROST MAKES UP HIS MIND""Well, Frank,"" said his father at supper-time, ""I\'ve been speaking toMr. Maynard this afternoon about your plan.""""What did he say?"" asked Frank, dropping his knife and fork in hiseagerness.""After he had thought a little, he spoke of it favorably. He said that,being too old to go himself, he should be glad to do anything in hispower to facilitate my going, if I thought it my duty to do so.""""Didn\'t he think Frank rather young for such an undertaking?"" asked Mrs.Frost doubtfully.""Yes, he did; but still he thought with proper advice and competentassistance he might get along. For the first, he can depend upon Mr.Maynard and myself; as for the second, Mr. Maynard suggested a good man,who is seeking a situation as farm laborer.""""Is it anybody in this town?"" asked Frank.""No, it is a man from Brandon, named Jacob Carter. Mr. Maynard says heis honest, industrious, and used to working on a farm. I shall write tohim this evening.""""Then you have decided to go!"" exclaimed Frank and his mother inconcert.""It will depend in part upon the answer I receive from this man Carter.I shall feel if he agrees to come, that I can go with less anxiety.""""How we shall miss you!"" said his wife, in a subdued tone.""And I shall miss you quite as much. It will be a considerable sacrificefor all of us. But when my country has need of me, you will feel thatI cannot honorably stay at home. As for Frank, he may regard me as hissubstitute.""""My substitute!"" repeated Frank, in a questioning tone.""Yes, since but for you, taking charge of the farm in my absence, Ishould not feel that I could go.""Frank looked pleased. It made him feel that he was really of someimportance. Boys, unless they are incorrigibly idle, are glad to beplaced in posts of responsibility. Frank, though very modest, feltwithin himself unused powers and undeveloped capacities, which he knewmust be called out by the unusual circumstances in which he would beplaced. The thought, too, that he would be serving his country, even athome, filled him with satisfaction.After a pause, Mr. Frost said: ""There is one point on which I still havesome doubts. As you are all equally interested with myself, I think itproper to ask your opinion, and shall abide by your decision.""Frank and his mother listened with earnest attention.""You are aware that the town has decided to give a bounty of one hundredand fifty dollars to such as may volunteer toward filling the quota.You may remember, also, that although the town passed the vote almostunanimously, it was my proposition, and supported by a speech of mine.""""Squire Haynes opposed it, I think you said, father.""""Yes, and intimated that I urged the matter from interested motives. Hesaid he presumed I intended to enlist.""""As if that sum would pay a man for leaving his home and incurring theterrible risks of war!"" exclaimed Mrs. Frost, looking indignant.""Very likely he did not believe it himself; but he was irritated withme, and it is his habit to impute unworthy motives to those with whomhe differs. Aside from this, however, I shall feel some delicacy inavailing myself of a bounty which I was instrumental in persuading thetown to vote. Though I feel that I should be perfectly justified in sodoing, I confess that I am anxious not to put myself in such a positionas to hazard any loss of good opinion on the part of my friends intown.""""Then don\'t take it,"" said Mrs. Frost promptly.""That\'s what I say, too, father,"" chimed in Frank.""Don\'t decide too hastily,"" said Mr. Frost. ""Remember that in ourcircumstances this amount of money would be very useful. Although Frankwill do as well as any boy of his age, I do not expect him to make thefarm as profitable as I should do, partly on account of my experiencebeing greater, and partly because I should be able to accomplish morework than he. One hundred and fifty dollars would procure many littlecomforts which otherwise you may have to do without.""""I know that,"" said Mrs. Frost quickly. ""But do you think I shouldenjoy them, if there were reports circulated, however unjustly, to yourprejudice? Besides, I shall know that the comforts at the camp must befewer than you would enjoy at home. We shall not wish to fare so muchbetter than you.""""Do you think with your mother, Frank?"" asked Mr. Frost.""I think mother is right,"" said Frank, proud of having his opinionasked. He was secretly determined, in spite of what his father had said,to see if he could not make the farm as profitable as it would be underhis father\'s management.Mr. Frost seemed relieved by his wife\'s expression of opinion. ""Then,""said he, ""I will accept your decision as final. I felt that it should beyou, and not myself, who should decide it. Now my mind will be at ease,so far as that goes.""""You will not enlist at once, father?"" asked Frank.""Not for three or four weeks. I shall wish to give you some specialinstructions before I go, so that your task may be easier.""""Hadn\'t I better leave school at once?""""You may finish this week out. However, I may as well begin myinstructions without delay. I believe you have never learned to milk.""""No, sir.""""Probably Carter will undertake that. Still, it will be desirable thatyou should know how, in case he gets sick. You may come out with meafter supper and take your first lesson.""Frank ran for his hat with alacrity. This seemed like beginning inearnest. He accompanied his father to the barn, and looked with newinterest at the four cows constituting his father\'s stock.""I think we will begin with this one,"" said his father, pointing to ared-and-white heifer. ""She is better-natured than the others, and, as Idare say your fingers will bungle a little at first, that is a point tobe considered.""If any of my boy readers has ever undertaken the task of milking for thefirst time, he will appreciate Frank\'s difficulties. When he had seenhis father milking, it seemed to him extremely easy. The milk poured outin rich streams, almost without an effort. But under his inexperiencedfingers none came. He tugged away manfully, but with no result.""I guess the cow\'s dry,"" said he at last, looking up in his father\'sface.Mr. Frost in reply drew out a copious stream.""I did the same as you,"" said Frank, mystified, ""and none came.""""You didn\'t take hold right,"" said his father, ""and you pressed at thewrong time. Let me show you.""Before the first lesson was over Frank had advanced a little in the artof milking, and it may as well be said here that in the course of a weekor so he became a fair proficient, so that his father even allowed himto try Vixen, a cow who had received this name from the uncertainty ofher temper. She had more than once upset the pail with a spiteful kickwhen it was nearly full. One morning she upset not only the pail, butFrank, who looked foolish enough as he got up covered with milk.Frank also commenced reading the Plowman, a weekly agricultural paperwhich his father had taken for years. Until now he had confined hisreadings in it to the selected story on the fourth page. Now, with anobject in view, he read carefully other parts of the paper. He did thisnot merely in the first flush of enthusiasm, but with the steady purposeof qualifying himself to take his father\'s place.""Frank is an uncommon boy,"" said Mr. Frost to his wife, not withoutfeelings of pride, one night, when our hero had retired to bed. ""I wouldtrust him with the farm sooner than many who are half a dozen yearsolder.""']"
86,8,Chapter 8,"['VII. LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON""Well, father, I\'ve got some news for you,"" said John Haynes, as heentered his father\'s presence, two or three days later.""What is it, John?"" inquired the squire, laying down a copy of the NewYork Herald, which he had been reading.""Who do you think has enlisted?""""I do not choose to guess,"" said his father coldly. ""If you feeldisposed to tell me, you may do so.""John looked somewhat offended at his father\'s tone, but he was anxiousto tell the news. ""Frost\'s going to enlist,"" he said shortly.""Indeed!"" said the squire, with interest. ""How did you hear?""""I heard him say so himself, just now, in the store.""""I expected it,"" said Squire Haynes, with a sneer. ""I understood hismotives perfectly in urging the town to pay an enormous bounty tovolunteers. He meant to line his own pockets at the public expense.""""He says that he doesn\'t mean to accept the bounty,"" continued John, ina tone which indicated a doubt whether Mr. Frost was in earnest.""Did you hear him say that?"" asked Squire Haynes abruptly.""Yes, I heard him say so to Mr. Morse.""""Perhaps he means it, and perhaps he doesn\'t. If he don\'t take it, it isbecause he is afraid of public opinion. What\'s he going to do about thefarm, while he is gone?""""That is the strangest part of it,"" said John. ""I don\'t believe youcould guess who is to be left in charge of it.""""I don\'t choose to guess. If you know, speak out.""John bit his lip resentfully.""It\'s that conceited jackanapes of his--Frank Frost.""""Do you mean that he is going to leave that boy to carry on the farm?""demanded Squire Haynes, in surprise.""Yes.""""Well, all I can say is that he\'s more of a fool than I took him to be.""""Oh, he thinks everything of Frank,"" said John bitterly. ""He\'ll benominating him for representative next.""The squire winced a little. He had been ambitious to represent the townin the legislature, and after considerable wire-pulling had succeededin obtaining the nomination the year previous. But it is one thing tobe nominated and another to be elected. So the squire had found, to hiscost. He had barely obtained fifty votes, while his opponent had beenelected by a vote of a hundred and fifty. All allusions, therefore,recalling his mortifying defeat were disagreeable to him.""On the whole, I don\'t know but I\'m satisfied,"" he said, recurring tothe intelligence John had brought. ""So far as I am concerned, I am gladhe has made choice of this boy.""""You don\'t think he is competent?"" asked John, in surprise.""For that very reason I am glad he has been selected,"" said the squireemphatically. ""I take it for granted that the farm will be mismanaged,and become a bill of expense, instead of a source of revenue. It\'spretty certain that Frost won\'t be able to pay the mortgage when itcomes due. I can bid off the farm for a small sum additional and make acapital bargain. It will make a very good place for you to settle downupon, John.""""Me!"" said John disdainfully. ""You don\'t expect me to become a ploddingfarmer, I trust. I\'ve got talent for something better than that, Ishould hope.""""No,"" said the squire, ""I have other news for you. Still, you could hirea farmer to carry it on for you, and live out there in the summer.""""Well, perhaps that would do,"" said John, thinking that it would soundwell for him, even if he lived in the city, to have a place in thecountry. ""When does the mortgage come due, father?""""I don\'t remember the exact date. I\'ll look and see.""The squire drew from a closet a box hooped with iron, and evidently madefor security. This was his strong-box, and in this he kept his bonds,mortgages, and other securities.He selected a document tied with red ribbon, and examined it briefly.""I shall have the right to foreclose the mortgage on the first of nextJuly,"" he said.""I hope you will do it then. I should like to see them Frosts humbled.""""THEM Frosts! Don\'t you know anything more about English grammar, John?""""Those Frosts, then. Of course, I know; but a feller can\'t always bewatching his words.""""I desire you never again to use the low word \'feller,\'"" said thesquire, who, as the reader will see, was more particular aboutgrammatical accuracy than about some other things which might benaturally supposed to be of higher importance.""Well,"" said John sulkily, ""anything you choose.""""As to the mortgage,"" proceeded Squire Haynes, ""I have no idea they willbe able to lift it. I feel certain that Frost won\'t himself have themoney at command, and I sha\'n\'t give him any grace, or consent to arenewal. He may be pretty sure of that.""""Perhaps he\'ll find somebody to lend him the money.""""I think not. There are those who would be willing, but I questionwhether there is any such who could raise the money at a moment\'swarning. By the way, you need not mention my purpose in this matter toany one. If it should leak out, Mr. Frost might hear of it, and preparefor it.""""You may trust me for that, father,"" said John, very decidedly; ""Iwant to see Frank Frost\'s proud spirit humbled. Perhaps he\'ll feel likeputting on airs after that.""From the conversation which has just been chronicled it will beperceived that John was a worthy son of his father; and, though wantingin affection and cordial good feeling, that both were prepared to joinhands in devising mischief to poor Frank and his family. Let us hopethat the intentions of the wicked may be frustrated.']"
86,9,Chapter 9,"['VIII. DISCOURAGED AND ENCOURAGEDIn a small village like Rossville news flies fast. Even the distinctionsof social life do not hinder an interest being felt in the affairs ofeach individual. Hence it was that Mr. Frost\'s determination to enlistbecame speedily known, and various were the comments made upon his planof leaving Frank in charge of the farm. That they were not all favorablemay be readily believed. Country people are apt to criticize theproceedings of their neighbors with a greater degree of freedom than iscommon elsewhere.As Frank was on his way to school on Saturday morning, his name wascalled by Mrs. Roxana Mason, who stood in the doorway of a small yellowhouse fronting on the main street.""Good morning, Mrs. Mason,"" said Frank politely, advancing to the gatein answer to her call.""Is it true what I\'ve heard about your father\'s going to the war, FrankFrost?"" she commenced.""Yes, Mrs. Mason; he feels it his duty to go.""""And what\'s to become of the farm? Anybody hired it?""""I am going to take charge of it,"" said Frank modestly.""You!"" exclaimed Mrs. Roxana, lifting both hands in amazement; ""why,you\'re nothing but a baby!""""I\'m a baby of fifteen,"" said Frank good-humoredly, though his couragewas a little dampened by her tone.""What do you know about farming?"" inquired the lady, in a contemptuousmanner. ""Your father must be crazy!""""I shall do my best, Mrs. Mason,"" said Frank quietly, but withheightened color. ""My father is willing to trust me; and as I shall haveMr. Maynard to look to for advice, I think I can get along.""""The idea of putting a boy like you over a farm!"" returned Mrs. Roxana,in an uncompromising tone. ""I did think your father had more sense.It\'s the most shiftless thing I ever knew him to do. How does your poormother feel about it?""""She doesn\'t seem as much disturbed about it as you do, Mrs. Mason,""said Frank, rather impatiently; for he felt that Mrs. Mason had no rightto interfere in his father\'s arrangements.""Well, well, we\'ll see!"" said Mrs. Roxana, shaking her headsignificantly. ""If you\'ll look in your Bible, you\'ll read about \'thehaughty spirit that goes before a fall.\' I\'m sure I wish you wellenough. I hope that things\'ll turn out better\'n they\'re like to. Tellyour mother I\'ll come over before long and talk with her about it.""Frank inwardly hoped that Mrs. Roxana wouldn\'t put herself to anytrouble to call, but politeness taught him to be silent.Leaving Mrs. Mason\'s gate, he kept on his way to school, but had hardlygone half a dozen rods before he met an old lady, whose benevolent faceindicated a very different disposition from that of the lady he had justparted with.""Good morning, Mrs. Chester,"" said Frank cordially, recognizing one ofhis mother\'s oldest friends.""Good morning, my dear boy,"" was the reply. ""I hear your father is goingto the war.""""Yes,"" said Frank, a little nervously, not knowing but Mrs. Chesterwould view the matter in the same way as Mrs. Mason, though he felt sureshe would express herself less disagreeably.""And I hear that you are going to try to make his place good at home.""""I don\'t expect to make his place good, Mrs. Chester,"" said Frankmodestly, ""but I shall do as well as I can.""""I have no doubt of it, my dear boy,"" said the old lady kindly. ""You cando a great deal, too. You can help your mother by looking out for yourbrothers and sisters, as well as supplying your father\'s place on thefarm.""""I am glad you think I can make myself useful,"" said Frank, feelingrelieved. ""Mrs. Mason has just been telling me that I am not fit for thecharge, and that discouraged me a little.""""It\'s a great responsibility, no doubt, to come on one so young,"" saidthe old lady, ""but it\'s of God\'s appointment. He will strengthen yourhands, if you will only ask Him. If you humbly seek His guidance andassistance, you need not fear to fail.""""Yes,"" said Frank soberly, ""that\'s what I mean to do.""""Then you will feel that you are in the path of duty. You\'ll be servingyour country just as much as if you went yourself.""""That\'s just the way I feel, Mrs. Chester,"" exclaimed Frank eagerly. ""Iwant to do something for my country.""""You remind me of my oldest brother,"" said the old lady thoughtfully.""He was left pretty much as you are. It was about the middle of theRevolutionary war, and the army needed recruits. My father hesitated,for he had a small family depending on him for support. I was only twoyears old at the time, and there were three of us. Finally my brotherJames, who was just about your age, told my father that he would do allhe could to support the family, and father concluded to go. Wedidn\'t have a farm, for father was a carpenter. My brother worked forneighboring farmers, receiving his pay in corn and vegetables, andpicked up what odd jobs he could. Then mother was able to do something;so we managed after a fashion. There were times when we were broughtpretty close to the wall, but God carried us through. And by and byfather came safely home, and I don\'t think he ever regretted having leftus. After awhile the good news of peace came, and he felt that he hadbeen abundantly repaid for all the sacrifices he had made in the goodcause.""Frank listened to this narrative with great interest. It yielded himno little encouragement to know that another boy, placed in similarcircumstances, had succeeded, and he just felt that he would have verymuch less to contend against than the brother of whom Mrs. Chester spoke.""Thank you for telling me about your brother Mrs. Chester,"" he said. ""Itmakes me feel more as if things would turn out well. Won\'t you come oversoon and see us? Mother is always glad to see you.""""Thank you, Frank; I shall certainly do so. I hope I shall not make youlate to school.""""Oh, no; I started half an hour early this morning.""Frank had hardly left Mrs. Chester when he heard a quick step behindhim. Turning round, he perceived that it was Mr. Rathburn, his teacher.""I hurried to come up with you, Frank,"" he said, smiling. ""I understandthat I am to lose you from school.""""Yes, sir,"" answered Frank. ""I am very sorry to leave, for I am verymuch interested in my studies; but I suppose, sir, you have heard whatcalls me away.""""Your father has made up his mind to enlist.""""Yes, sir.""""And you are to superintend the farm in his absence?""""Yes, sir. I hope you do not think me presumptuous in undertaking such aresponsibility?""He looked up eagerly into Mr. Rathburn\'s face, for he had a greatrespect for his judgment. But he saw nothing to discourage him. On thecontrary, he read cordial sympathy and approval.""Far from it,"" answered the teacher, with emphasis. ""I think youdeserving of great commendation, especially if, as I have heard, theplan originated with you, and was by you suggested to your father.""""Yes, sir.""The teacher held out his hand kindly. ""It was only what I should haveexpected of you,"" he said. ""I have not forgotten your essay. I am gladto see that you not only have right ideas of duty, but have, what israrer, the courage and self-denial to put them in practice.""These words gave Frank much pleasure, and his face lighted up.""Shall you feel obliged to give up your studies entirely?"" asked histeacher.""I think I shall be able to study some in the evening.""""If I can be of any assistance to you in any way, don\'t hesitate toapply. If you should find any stumbling-blocks in your lessons, I may beable to help you over them.""By this time they had come within sight of the schoolhouse.""There comes the young farmer,"" said John Haynes, in a tone which wasonly subdued lest the teacher should hear him, for he had no dispositionto incur another public rebuke.A few minutes later, when Frank was quietly seated at his desk, a paperwas thrown from behind, lighting upon his Virgil, which lay open beforehim. There appeared to be writing upon it, and with some curiosity heopened and read the following:""What\'s the price of turnips?""It was quite unnecessary to inquire into the authorship. He feltconfident it was written by John Haynes. The latter, of course, intendedit as an insult, but Frank did not feel much disturbed. As long as hisconduct was approved by such persons as his teacher and Mrs. Chester, hefelt he could safely disregard the taunts and criticisms of others. Hetherefore quietly let the paper drop to the floor, and kept on with hislesson.John Haynes perceived that he had failed in his benevolent purposeof disturbing Frank\'s tranquillity, and this, I am sorry to say, onlyincreased the dislike he felt for him. Nothing is so unreasonable asanger, nothing so hard to appease. John even felt disposed to regard asan insult the disposition which Frank had made of his insulting query.""The young clodhopper\'s on his dignity,"" he muttered to himself. ""Well,wait a few months, and see if he won\'t sing a different tune.""Just then John\'s class was called up, and his dislike to Frank was notdiminished by the superiority of his recitation. The latter, undisturbedby John\'s feelings, did not give a thought to him, but reflected with atouch of pain that this must be his last Latin recitation in school fora long time to come.']"
86,10,Chapter 10,"['IX. THE LAST EVENING AT HOMEThree weeks passed quickly. October had already reached its middlepoint. The glory of the Indian summer was close at hand. Too quicklythe days fled for the little family at the farm, for they knew that eachbrought nearer the parting of which they could not bear to think.Jacob Carter, who had been sent for to do the heavy work on the farm,had arrived. He was a man of forty, stout and able to work, but hadenjoyed few opportunities of cultivating his mind. Though a faithfullaborer, he was destitute of the energy and ambition which might erethis have placed him in charge of a farm of his own. In New England fewarrive at his age without achieving some position more desirable andindependent than that of farm laborer. However, he looked pleasant andgood-natured, and Mr. Frost accounted himself fortunate in securing hisservices.The harvest had been got in, and during the winter months there wouldnot be so much to do as before. Jacob, therefore, ""hired out"" for asmaller compensation, to be increased when the spring work came in.Frank had not been idle. He had accompanied his father about the farm,and received as much practical instruction in the art of farming asthe time would admit. He was naturally a quick learner, and now feltimpelled by a double motive to prepare himself as well as possible toassume his new responsibilities. His first motive was, of course, tomake up his father\'s loss to the family, as far as it was possible forhim to do so, but he was also desirous of showing Mrs. Roxana Mason andother ill-boding prophets that they had underrated his abilities.The time came when Mr. Frost felt that he must leave his family. He hadenlisted from preference in an old regiment, already in Virginia, somemembers of which had gone from Rossville. A number of recruits were tobe forwarded to the camp on a certain day, and that day was now close athand.Let me introduce the reader to the farmhouse on the last evening formany months when they would be able to be together. They were allassembled about the fireplace. Mr. Frost sat in an armchair, holdingCharlie in his lap--the privileged place of the youngest. Alice,with the air of a young woman, sat demurely by her father\'s side on acricket, while Maggie stood beside him, with one hand resting on hisknee. Frank sat quietly beside his mother, as if already occupying theplace which he was in future to hold as her counselor and protector.Frank and his mother looked sober. They had not realized fully untilthis evening what it would be to part with the husband and father--howconstantly they would miss him at the family meal and in the eveningcircle. Then there was the dreadful uncertainty of war. He might neverreturn, or, if spared for that, it might be with broken constitution orthe loss of a limb.""If it hadn\'t been for me,"" Frank could not help thinking, ""father wouldnot now be going away. He would have stayed at home, and I could stillgo to school. It would have made a great difference to us, and the lossof one man could not affect the general result.""A moment after his conscience rebuked him for harboring so selfish athought.""The country needs him more even than we do,"" he said to himself. ""Itwill be a hard trial to have him go, but it is our duty.""""Will my little Charlie miss me when I am gone?"" asked Mr. Frost of thechubby-faced boy who sat with great, round eyes peering into the fire,as if he were deeply engaged in thought.""Won\'t you take me with you, papa?"" asked Charlie.""What could you do if you were out there, my little boy?"" asked thefather, smiling.""I\'d shoot great big rebel with my gun,"" said Charlie, waxing valiant.""Your gun\'s only a wooden one,"" said Maggie, with an air of superiorknowledge. ""You couldn\'t kill a rebel with that.""""I\'d kill \'em some,"" persisted Charlie earnestly, evidently believingthat a wooden gun differed from others not in kind, but in degree.""But suppose the rebels should fire at you,"" said Frank, amused. ""Whatwould you do then, Charlie?""Charlie looked into the fire thoughtfully for a moment, as if thiscontingency had not presented itself to his mind until now. Suddenlyhis face brightened up, and he answered. ""I\'d run away just as fast as Icould.""All laughed at this, and Frank said: ""But that wouldn\'t be acting like abrave soldier, Charlie. You ought to stay and make the enemy run.""""I wouldn\'t want to stay and be shooted,"" said Charlie ingenuously.""There are many older than Charlie,"" said Mr. Frost, smiling, ""whowould doubtless sympathize entirely with him in his objection to beingshooted, though they might not be quite so ready to make confession ashe has shown himself. I suppose you have heard the couplet:          ""\'He who fights and runs away               May live to fight another day.\'""""Pray don\'t speak about shooting,"" said Mrs. Frost, with a shudder. ""Itmakes me feel nervous.""""And to-night we should only admit pleasant thoughts,"" said her husband.""Who is going to write me letters when I am gone?""""I\'ll write to you, father,"" said Alice.""And so will I,"" said Maggie.""I, too,"" chimed in Charlie.""Then, if you have so many correspondents already engaged, you willhardly want to hear from Frank and myself,"" said his wife, smiling.""The more the better. I suspect I shall find letters more welcome thananything else. You must also send me papers regularly. I shall have manyhours that will pass heavily unless I have something to read.""""I\'ll mail you Harper\'s Weekly regularly, shall I, father?"" asked Frank.""Yes, I shall be glad enough to see it. Then, there is one good thingabout papers--after enjoying them myself, I can pass them round toothers. There are many privations that I must make up my mind to, but Ishall endeavor to make camp-life as pleasant as possible to myself andothers.""""I wish you were going out as an officer,"" said Mrs. Frost. ""You wouldhave more indulgences.""""Very probably I should. But I don\'t feel inclined to wish myself betteroff than others. I am: willing to serve my country in any capacity inwhich I can be of use. Thank Heaven, I am pretty strong and healthy, andbetter fitted than many to encounter the fatigues and exposures whichare the lot of the private.""""How early must you start to-morrow, father?"" inquired Frank.""By daylight. I must be in Boston by nine o\'clock, and you know it is afive-mile ride to the depot. I shall want you to carry me over.""""Will there be room for me?"" asked Mrs. Frost. ""I want to see the lastof you.""""I hope you won\'t do that for a long time to come,"" said Mr. Frost,smiling.""You know what I mean, Henry.""""Oh, yes, there will be room. At any rate, we will make room for you.And now it seems to me it is time for these little folks to go to bed.Charlie finds it hard work to keep his eyes open.""""Oh, papa, papa, not yet, not yet,"" pleaded the children; and with thethought that it might be many a long day before he saw their sweet youngfaces again, the father suffered them to have their way.After the children had gone to bed Frank and his father and mother satup for a long time. Each felt that there was much to be said, but noone of them felt like saying much then. Thoughts of the approachingseparation swallowed up all others. The thought kept recurring thatto-morrow would see them many miles apart, and that many a longto-morrow must pass before they would again be gathered around the fire.""Frank,"" said his father, at length, ""I have deposited in the BrandonBank four hundred dollars, about half of which I have realized fromcrops sold this season. This you will draw upon as you have need, forgrocery bills, to pay Jacob, etc. For present purposes I will hand youfifty dollars, which I advise you to put under your mother\'s care.""As he finished speaking, Mr. Frost drew from his pocketbook a roll ofbills and handed them to Frank.Frank opened his portemonnaie and deposited the money therein.He had never before so large a sum of money in his possession, andalthough he knew it was not to be spent for his own benefit--at least,no considerable part of it--he felt a sense of importance and evenwealth in being the custodian of so much money. He felt that hisfather had confidence in him, and that he was in truth going to be hisrepresentative.""A part of the money which I have in the bank,"" continued his father,""has been saved up toward the payment of the mortgage on the farm.""""When does it come due, father?""""On the first of July of next year.""""But you won\'t be prepared to meet it at that time?""""No, but undoubtedly Squire Haynes will be willing to renew it. I alwayspay the interest promptly, and he knows it is secured by the farm, andtherefore a safe investment. By the way, I had nearly forgotten to saythat there will be some interest due on the first of January. Of course,you are authorized to pay it just as if you were myself.""""How much will it be?""""Twenty-four dollars--that is, six months\' interest at six per cent. oneight hundred dollars.""""I wish the farm were free from encumbrance,"" said Frank.""So do I; and if Providence favors me it shall be before many years arepast. But in farming one can\'t expect to lay by money quite as fast asin some other employments.""The old clock in the corner here struck eleven.""We mustn\'t keep you up too late the last night, Henry,"" said Mrs.Frost. ""You will need a good night\'s sleep to carry you throughto-morrow.""Neither of the three closed their eyes early that night. Thoughts ofthe morrow were naturally in their minds. At last all was still.Sleep--God\'s beneficent messenger--wrapped their senses in oblivion, andthe cares and anxieties of the morrow were for a time forgotten.']"
86,11,Chapter 11,"['X. LITTLE POMPThere was a hurried good-by at the depot.""Kiss the children for me, Mary,"" said her husband.""You will write very soon?"" pleaded Mrs. Frost.""At the very first opportunity.""""All aboard!"" shouted the conductor.With a shrill scream the locomotive started.Frank and his mother stood on the platform watching the receding traintill it was quite out of sight, and then in silence our young heroassisted his mother into the carryall and turned the horse\'s headhomeward.It was one of those quiet October mornings, when the air is soft andbalmy as if a June day had found its way by mistake into the heart ofautumn. The road wound partly through the woods. The leaves were stillgreen and abundant. Only one or two showed signs of the coming change,which in the course of a few weeks must leave them bare and leafless.""What a beautiful day!"" said Frank, speaking the words almostunconsciously.""Beautiful indeed!"" responded his mother. ""On such a day as this theworld seems too lovely for war and warlike passions to be permitted toenter it. When men might be so happy, why need they stain their handswith each other\'s blood?""Frank was unprepared for an answer. He knew that it was his father\'sdeparture which led his mother to speak thus. He wished to divert hermind, if possible.Circumstances favored his design.They had accomplished perhaps three-quarters of the distance home when,as they were passing a small one-story building by the roadside, ashriek of pain was heard, and a little black boy came running out of thehouse, screaming in affright: ""Mammy\'s done killed herself. She\'s mos\'dead!""He ran out to the road and looked up at Mrs. Frost, as if to imploreassistance.""That\'s Chloe\'s child,"" said Mrs. Frost. ""Stop the horse, Frank; I\'llget out and see what has happened.""Chloe, as Frank very well knew, was a colored woman, who until a fewmonths since had been a slave in Virginia. Finally she had seized afavorable opportunity, and taking the only child which the cruel slavesystem had left her, for the rest had been sold South, succeeded inmaking her way into Pennsylvania. Chance had directed her to Rossville,where she had been permitted to occupy, rent free, an old shanty whichfor some years previous had been uninhabited. Here she had supportedherself by taking in washing and ironing. This had been her special workon the plantation where she had been born and brought up, and she wastherefore quite proficient in it. She found no difficulty in obtainingwork enough to satisfy the moderate wants of herself and little Pomp.The latter was a bright little fellow, as black as the ace of spades,and possessing to the full the mercurial temperament of the Southernnegro. Full of fun and drollery, he attracted plenty of attention whenhe came into the village, and earned many a penny from the boys by hisplantation songs and dances.Now, however, he appeared in a mood entirely different, and it was easyto see that he was much frightened.""What\'s the matter, Pomp?"" asked Frank, as he brought his horse to astandstill.""Mammy done killed herself,"" he repeated, wringing his hands in terror.A moan from the interior of the house seemed to make it clear thatsomething had happened.Mrs. Frost pushed the door open and entered.Chloe had sunk down on the floor and was rocking back and forth, holdingher right foot in both hands, with an expression of acute pain on hersable face. Beside her was a small pail, bottom upward.Mrs. Frost was at no loss to conjecture the nature of the accident whichhad befallen her. The pail had contained hot water, and its accidentaloverturn had scalded poor Chloe.""Are you much hurt, Chloe?"" asked Mrs. Frost sympathizingly.""Oh, missus, I\'s most dead,"" was the reply, accompanied by a groan.""\'Spect I sha\'n\'t live till mornin\'. Dunno what\'ll become of poor Pompwhen I\'se gone.""Little Pomp squeezed his knuckles into his eyes and responded with anunearthly howl.""Don\'t be too much frightened, Chloe,"" said Mrs. Frost soothingly.""You\'ll get over it sooner than you think. How did the pail happen toturn over?""""Must have been de debbel, missus. I was kerryin\' it just as keerful,when all at once it upsot.""This explanation, though not very luminous to her visitor, appeared toexcite a fierce spirit of resentment against the pail in the mind oflittle Pomp.He suddenly rushed forward impetuously and kicked the pail with all theforce he could muster.But, alas for poor Pomp! His feet were unprotected by shoes, and thesudden blow hurt him much more than the pail. The consequence was a howlof the most distressing nature.Frank had started forward to rescue Pomp from the consequences of hisprecipitancy, but too late. He picked up the little fellow and, carryinghim out, strove to soothe him.Meanwhile, Mrs. Frost examined Chloe\'s injuries. They were not so greatas she had anticipated. She learned on inquiry that the water had notbeen scalding hot. There was little doubt that with proper care shewould recover from her injuries in a week or ten days. But in themeantime it would not do to use the foot.""What shall I do, missus?"" groaned Chloe. ""I ain\'t got nothin\' baked up.\'Pears like me and Pomp must starve.""""Not so bad as that, Chloe,"" said Mrs. Frost, with a reassuring smile.""After we have you on the bed we will take Pomp home with us, and givehim enough food to last you both a couple of days. At the end of thattime, or sooner, if you get out, you can send him up again.""Chloe expressed her gratitude warmly, and Mrs. Frost, calling in Frank\'sassistance, helped the poor woman to a comfortable position on thebed, which fortunately was in the corner of the same room. Had itbeen upstairs, the removal would have been attended with considerabledifficulty as well as pain to Chloe.Pomp, the acuteness of whose pain had subsided, looked on with wonderingeyes while Frank and Mrs. Frost ""toted"" his mother onto the bed, as heexpressed it.Chloe accepted, with wondering gratitude, the personal attentions ofMrs. Frost, who bound up the injured foot with a softness of touch whichbrought no pain to the sufferer.""You ain\'t too proud, missus, to tend to a poor black woman,"" she said.""Down Souf dey used to tell us dat everybody looked down on de poornigger and lef\' \'em to starve an\' die if dey grow sick.""""They told you a great many things that were not true, Chloe,"" said Mrs.Frost quietly. ""The color of the skin ought to make no difference wherewe have it in our power to render kind offices.""""Do you believe niggers go to de same heaven wid w\'ite folks, missus?""asked Chloe, after a pause.""Why should they not? They were made by the same God.""""I dunno, missus,"" said Chloe. ""I hopes you is right.""""Do you think you can spare Pomp a little while to go home with us?""""Yes, missus. Here you, Pomp,"" she called, ""you go home wid dis goodlady, and she\'ll gib you something for your poor sick mudder. Do youhear?""""I\'se goin\' to ride?"" said Pomp inquiringly.""Yes,"" said Frank good-naturedly.""Hi, hi, dat\'s prime!"" ejaculated Pomp, turning a somersault in his joy.""Scramble in, then, and we\'ll start.""Pomp needed no second invitation. He jumped into the carriage, and wasmore leisurely followed by Frank and his mother.It was probably the first time that Pomp had ever been in a coveredcarriage, and consequently the novelty of his situation put him in highspirits.He was anxious to drive, and Frank, to gratify him, placed the reinsin his hands. His eyes sparkling with delight, and his expanded mouthshowing a full set of ivories, Pomp shook the reins in glee, shoutingout, ""Hi, go along there, you ol\' debble!""""Pomp, you mustn\'t use that word,"" said Mrs. Frost reprovingly.""What word, missus?"" demanded Pomp innocently.""The last word you used,"" she answered.""Don\'t \'member what word you mean, missus,"" said Pomp. ""Hi, you debble!""""That\'s the word?""""Not say \'debble\'?"" said Pomp wonderingly. ""Why not, missus?""""It isn\'t a good word.""""Mammy says \'debble.\' She calls me little debble when I run away, anddon\'t tote in de wood.""""I shall tell her not to use it. It isn\'t a good word for anybody touse.""""Hope you\'ll tell her so, missus,"" said Pomp, grinning and showing histeeth. ""Wheneber she calls me little debble she pulls off her shoe andhits me. Hurts like de debble. Mebbe she won\'t hit me if you tell hernot to say \'debble.\'""Mrs. Frost could hardly forbear laughing. She managed, however, topreserve a serious countenance while she said, ""You must take care tobehave well, and then she won\'t have to punish you.""It is somewhat doubtful whether Pomp heard this last remark. He espied apig walking by the side of the road, and was seized with a desire to runover it. Giving the reins a sudden twitch, he brought the carriage roundso that it was very near upsetting in a gully.Frank snatched the reins in time to prevent this catastrophe.""What did you do that for, Pomp?"" he said quickly.""Wanted to scare de pig,"" exclaimed Pomp, laughing. ""Wanted to hear himsqueal.""""And so you nearly tipped us over.""""Didn\'t mean to do dat, Mass\' Frank. \'Pears like I didn\'t think.""Mrs. Frost was too much alarmed by this narrow escape to consent toPomp\'s driving again, and for the moment felt as if she should like tousurp his mother\'s privilege of spanking him. But the little imp lookedso unconscious of having done anything wrong that her vexation soonpassed away.In half an hour Pomp was on his way back, laden with a basketful ofprovisions for his sick mother and himself.']"
86,12,Chapter 12,"['XI. PUNISHING A BULLYIt was fortunate for Mrs. Frost that she was so soon called upon tothink for others. It gave her less time to grieve over her husband\'sabsence, which was naturally a severe trial to her. As for Frank, thoughthe harvest was gathered in, there were plenty of small jobs to occupyhis attention. He divided with Jacob the care of the cows, and was upbetimes in the morning to do his share of the milking. Then the pigs andchickens must be fed every day, and this Frank took entirely into hisown charge. Wood, also, must be prepared for the daily wants of thehouse, and this labor he shared with Jacob.In the afternoon, however, Frank usually had two or three hours at hisown disposal, and this, in accordance with a previous determination, heresolved to devote to keeping up his studies. He did not expect tomake the same progress that he would have done if he had been ableto continue at school, but it was something to feel that he was notremaining stationary.Frank resolved to say nothing to his classmates about his privatestudies. They would think he was falling far behind, and at some futuretime he would surprise them.Still, there were times when he felt the need of a teacher. He wouldoccasionally encounter difficulties which he found himself unable tosurmount without assistance. At such times he thought of Mr Rathburn\'skind offer. But his old teacher lived nearly a mile distant, and he feltaverse to troubling him, knowing that his duties in school were arduous.Occasionally he met some of his schoolmates. As nearly all of them werefriendly and well-disposed to him, this gave him pleasure, and broughtback sometimes the wish that he was as free as they. But this wish wasalmost instantly checked by the thought that he had made a sacrifice forhis country\'s sake.A few days after the incident narrated in the last chapter, Frank wasout in the woods not far from Chloe\'s cottage, collecting brushwood,to be afterward carried home, when his attention was called to analtercation, one of the parties in which he readily recognized as littlePomp. To explain how it came about, we shall have to go back a little.Pomp was returning from Mrs. Frost\'s, swinging a tin kettle containingprovisions for his mother and himself, when all at once he met JohnHaynes, who was coming from the opposite direction.Now, John was something of a bully, and liked to exercise authority overthe boys who were small enough to render the attempt a safe one. On thepresent occasion he felt in a hectoring mood.""I\'ll have some fun out of the little nigger,"" he said to himself, as heespied Pomp.Pomp approached, swinging his pail as before, and whistling a plantationmelody.""What have you got there, Pomp?"" asked John.""I\'se got a pail,"" said Pomp independently. ""Don\'t yer know a pail whenyou see him?""""I know an impudent little nigger when I see him,"" retorted John, notoverpleased with the answer. ""Come here directly, and let me see whatyou\'ve got in your pail.""""I ain\'t got noffin for you,"" said Pomp defiantly.""We\'ll see about that,"" said John. ""Now, do you mean to come here ornot? I\'m going to count three, and I\'ll give you that time to decide.One--two--three!""Pomp apparently had no intention of complying with John\'s request.He had halted about three rods from him, and stood swinging his pail,meanwhile watching John warily.""I see you want me to come after you,"" said John angrily.He ran toward Pomp, but the little contraband dodged him adroitly, andgot on the other side of a tree.Opposition only stimulated John to new efforts. He had become excited inthe pursuit, and had made up his mind to capture Pomp, who dodged inand out among the trees with such quickness and dexterity that Johnwas foiled for a considerable time. The ardor of his pursuit and itsunexpected difficulty excited his anger. He lost sight of the fact thatPomp was under no obligation to comply with his demand. But this isgenerally the way with tyrants, who are seldom careful to keep withinthe bounds of justice and reason.""Just let me catch you, you little rascal, and I will give you the worstlicking you ever had,"" John exclaimed, with passion.""Wait till you catch me,"" returned Pomp, slipping, eel-like, from hisgrasp.But Pomp, in dodging, had now come to an open space, where he was ata disadvantage. John was close upon him, when suddenly he stoodstock-still, bending his back so as to obtain a firm footing. Theconsequence was that his too ardent pursuer tumbled over him, andstretched his length upon the ground.Unfortunately for Pomp, John grasped his leg in falling, and held itby so firm a grip that he was unable to get free. In the moment of hisdownfall John attained his object.""Now I\'ve got you,"" he said, white with passion, ""and I\'m going to teachyou a lesson.""Clinging to Pomp with one hand, he drew a stout string from hispocket with the other, and secured the hands of the little contraband,notwithstanding his efforts to escape.""Le\' me go, you debble,"" he said, using a word which had grown familiarto him on the plantation.There was a cruel light in John\'s eyes which augured little good to poorPomp. Suddenly, as if a new idea had struck him, he loosened the cord,and taking the boy carried him, in spite of his kicking and screaming,to a small tree, around which he clasped his hands, which he againconfined with cords.He then sought out a stout stick, and divested it of twigs.Pomp watched his preparations with terror. Too well he knew what theymeant. More than once he had seen those of his own color whipped on theplantation. Unconsciously, he glided into the language which he wouldhave used there.""Don\'t whip me, Massa John,"" he whimpered in terror. ""For the lub ofHeaven, lef me be. I ain\'t done noffin\' to you.""""You\'d better have thought of that before,"" said John, his eyes blazinganew with vengeful light. ""If I whip you, you little black rascal, it\'sonly because you richly deserve it.""""I\'ll nebber do so again,"" pleaded Pomp, rolling his eyes in terror.Though what it was he promised not to do the poor little fellow wouldhave found it hard to tell.It would have been as easy to soften the heart of a nether millstone asthat of John Haynes.By the time he had completed his preparations, and whirled his stick inthe air preparatory to bringing it down with full force on Pomp\'s back,rapid steps were heard, and a voice asked, ""What are you doing there,John Haynes?""John looked round, and saw standing near him Frank Frost, whoseattention had been excited by what he had heard of Pomp\'s cries.""Save me, save me, Mass\' Frank,"" pleaded poor little Pomp.""What has he tied you up there for, Pomp?""""It\'s none of your business, Frank Frost,"" said John passionately.""I think it\'s some of my business,"" said Frank coolly, ""when I find youplaying the part of a Southern overseer. You are not in Richmond, JohnHaynes, and you\'ll get into trouble if you undertake to act as if youwere.""""If you say much more, I\'ll flog you too!"" screamed John, beside himselfwith excitement and rage.Frank had not a particle of cowardice in his composition. He was notfond of fighting, but he felt that circumstances made it necessary forhim to do so now. He did not easily lose his temper, and this at presentgave him the advantage over John.""You are too excited to know what you are talking about,"" he saidcoolly. ""Pomp, why has he tied you up?""Pomp explained that John had tried to get his pail from him. He closedby imploring ""Mass\' Frank"" to prevent John from whipping him.""He shall not whip you, Pomp,"" said Frank quietly. As he spoke hestepped to the tree and faced John intrepidly.John, in a moment of less passion, would not have ventured to attack aboy so near his own size. Like all bullies, he was essentially a coward,but now his rage got the better of his prudence.""I\'ll flog you both!"" he exclaimed hoarsely, and sprang forward withupraised stick.Frank was about half a head shorter than John, and was more than a yearyounger, but he was stout and compactly built; besides, he was cool andcollected, and this is always an advantage.Before John realized what had happened, his stick had flown from hishand, and he was forcibly pushed back, so that he narrowly escapedfalling to the ground.""Gib it to him, Mass\' Frank!"" shouted little Pomp. ""Gib it to him!""This increased John\'s exasperation. By this time he was almost foamingat the mouth.""I\'ll kill you, Frank Frost,"" he exclaimed, this time rushing at himwithout a stick.Frank had been in the habit of wrestling for sport with the boys of hisown size. In this way he had acquired a certain amount of dexterity in""tripping up."" John, on the contrary, was unpractised. His quick temperwas so easily roused that other boys had declined engaging in friendlycontests with him, knowing that in most cases they would degenerate intoa fight.John rushed forward, and attempted to throw Frank by the strength of hisarms alone. Frank eluded his grasp, and, getting one of his legs aroundJohn\'s, with a quick movement tripped him up. He fell heavily upon hisback.""This is all foolish, John,"" said Frank, bending over his fallen foe.""What are you fighting for? The privilege of savagely whipping a poorlittle fellow less than half your age?""""I care more about whipping you, a cursed sight!"" said John, takingadvantage of Frank\'s withdrawing his pressure to spring to his feet.""You first, and him afterward!""Again he threw himself upon Frank; but again coolness and practiceprevailed against blind fury and untaught strength, and again he layprostrate.By this time Pomp had freed himself from the string that fettered hiswrists, and danced in glee round John Haynes, in whose discomfiture hefelt great delight.""You\'d better pick up your pail and run home,"" said Frank. He wasgenerously desirous of saving John from further humiliation. ""Will yougo away quietly if I will let you up, John?"" he asked.""No, d---- you!"" returned John, writhing, his face almost livid withpassion.""I am sorry,"" said Frank, ""for in that case I must continue to hold youdown.""""What is the trouble, boys?"" came from an unexpected quarter.It was Mr. Maynard, who, chancing to pass along the road, had beenattracted by the noise of the struggle.Frank explained in a few words.""Let him up, Frank,"" said the old man. ""I\'ll see that he does no furtherharm.""John rose to his feet, and looked scowlingly from one to the other, asif undecided whether he had not better attack both.""You\'ve disgraced yourself, John Haynes,"" said the old farmerscornfully. ""So you would turn negro-whipper, would you? Your talentsare misapplied here at the North. Brutality isn\'t respectable here, mylad. You\'d better find your way within the rebel lines, and then perhapsyou can gratify your propensity for whipping the helpless.""""Some day I\'ll be revenged on you for this,"" said John, turningwrathfully upon Frank. ""Perhaps you think I don\'t mean it, but the daywill come when you\'ll remember what I say.""""I wish you no harm, John,"" said Frank composedly, ""but I sha\'n\'t standby and see you beat a boy like Pomp.""""No,"" said the farmer sternly; ""and if ever I hear of your doing it,I\'ll horsewhip you till you beg for mercy. Now go home, and carry yourdisgrace with you.""Mr. Maynard spoke contemptuously, but with decision, and pointed up theroad.With smothered wrath John obeyed his order, because he saw that it wouldnot be safe to refuse.""I\'ll come up with him yet,"" he muttered to himself, as he walkedquietly toward home. ""If he doesn\'t rue this day, my name isn\'t JohnHaynes.""John did not see fit to make known the circumstances of his quarrel withFrank, feeling, justly, that neither his design nor the result wouldreflect any credit upon himself. But his wrath was none the less deepbecause he brooded over it in secret. He would have renewed his attemptupon Pomp, but there was something in Mr. Maynard\'s eye which assuredhim that his threat would be carried out. Frank, solicitous for thelittle fellow\'s safety, kept vigilant watch over him for some days, butno violence was attempted. He hoped John had forgotten his threats.']"
86,13,Chapter 13,"['XII. A LETTER FROM THE CAMPThe little family at the Frost farm looked forward with anxiouseagerness to the first letter from the absent father.Ten days had elapsed when Frank was seen hurrying up the road withsomething in his hand.Alice saw him first, and ran in, exclaiming, ""Mother, I do believe Frankhas got a letter from father. He is running up the road.""Mrs. Frost at once dropped her work, no less interested than herdaughter, and was at the door just as Frank, flushed with running,reached the gate.""What\'ll you give me for a letter?"" he asked triumphantly.""Give it to me quick,"" said Mrs. Frost. ""I am anxious to learn whetheryour father is well.""""I guess he is, or he wouldn\'t have written such a long letter.""""How do you know it\'s long?"" asked Alice. ""You haven\'t read it.""""I judge from the weight. There are two stamps on the envelope. I wastempted to open it, but, being directed to mother, I didn\'t venture.""Mrs. Frost sat down, and the children gathered round her, while she readthe following letter:                    ""CAMP --------, Virginia.""DEAR MARY: When I look about me, and consider the novelty andstrangeness of my surroundings, I can hardly realize that it is only aweek since I sat in our quiet sitting-room at the farm, with you andour own dear ones around me. I will try to help your imagination to apicture of my present home.""But first let me speak of my journey hither.""It was tedious enough, traveling all day by rail. Of course, littleliberty was allowed us. Military discipline is rigid, and must bemaintained. Of its necessity we had a convincing proof at a smallstation between Hartford and New Haven. One of our number, who, Iaccidentally learned, is a Canadian, and had only been tempted to enlistby the bounty, selected a seat by the door of the car. I had noticed forsome time that he looked nervous and restless, as if he had something onhis mind.""At one of our stopping-places--a small, obscure station--he creptout of the door, and, as he thought, unobserved, dodged behind a shed,thinking, no doubt, that the train would go off without him. Butan officer had his eye upon him, and a minute afterward he wasignominiously brought back and put under guard. I am glad to say thathis case inspired no sympathy. To enlist, obtain a bounty, and thenattempt to evade the service for which the bounty was given, isdespicable in the extreme. I am glad to know that no others of ourcompany had the least desire to follow this man\'s example.""We passed through New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, but I cangive you little idea of either of these cities. The time we passed ineach was mostly during the hours of darkness, when there was littleopportunity of seeing anything.""In Washington I was fortunate enough to see our worthy President. Wewere marching down Pennsylvania Avenue at the time. On the opposite sideof the street we descried a very tall man, of slender figure, walkingthoughtfully along, not appearing to notice what was passing around him.""The officer in command turned and said: \'Boys, look sharp. That isAbraham Lincoln, across the way.\'""Of course, we all looked eagerly toward the man of whom we had heard somuch.""I could not help thinking how great a responsibility rests upon thisman--to how great an extent the welfare and destinies of our belovedcountry depend upon his patriotic course.""As I noticed his features, which, plain as they are, bear theunmistakable marks of a shrewd benevolence, and evince also, as I think,acute and original powers of mind, I felt reassured. I could not helpsaying to myself: \'This man is at least honest, and if he does not carryus in safety through this tremendous crisis, it will not be for the lackof an honest determination to do his duty.\'""And now let me attempt to give you a picture of our present situation,with some account of the way we live.""Our camp may appropriately be called \'Hut Village.\' Imagine severalavenues lined with square log huts, surmounted by tent-coverings. Thelogs are placed transversely, and are clipped at the ends, so as to fiteach other more compactly. In this way the interstices are made muchnarrower than they would otherwise be. These, moreover, are filled inwith mud, which, as you have probably heard, is a staple production ofVirginia. This is a good protection against the cold, though it does notgive our dwellings a very elegant appearance.""Around most of our huts shallow trenches are dug, to carry off thewater, thus diminishing the dampness. Most of the huts are not floored,but mine, fortunately, is an exception to the general rule. My comradessucceeded in obtaining some boards somewhere, and we are a little inadvance of our neighbors in this respect.""Six of us are lodged in a tent. It is pretty close packing, butwe don\'t stand upon ceremony here. My messmates seem to be pleasantfellows. I have been most attracted to Frank Grover; a bright youngfellow of eighteen. He tells me that he is an only son, and his motheris a widow.""\'Wasn\'t your mother unwilling to have you come out here?\' I asked himone day.""\'No,\' he answered, \'not unwilling. She was only sorry for thenecessity. When I told her that I felt it to be my duty, she told me atonce to go. She said she would never stand between me and my country.\'""\'You must think of her often,\' I said.""\'All the time,\' he answered seriously, a thoughtful expressionstealing over his young face. \'I write to her twice a week regular, andsometimes oftener. For her sake I hope my life may be spared to return.\'""\'I hope so, too,\' I answered warmly. Then after a minute\'s silence, Iadded from some impulse: \'Will you let me call you Frank? I have a boyat home, not many years younger than you. His name is Frank also--itwill seem to remind me of him.\'""\'I wish you would,\' he answered, his face lighting up with evidentpleasure. \'Everybody calls me Frank at home, and I am tired of beingcalled Grover.\'""So our compact was made. I shall feel a warm interest in this braveboy, and I fervently hope that the chances of war will leave himunscathed.""I must give you a description of Hiram Marden, another of our smallcompany, a very different kind of person from Frank Grover. But it takesall sorts of characters to make an army, as well as a world, and Mardenis one of the oddities. Imagine a tall young fellow, with a thin face,lantern jaws, and long hair \'slicked\' down on either side. Though hemay be patriotic, he was led into the army from a different cause. Hecherished an attachment for a village beauty, who did not return hislove. He makes no concealment of his rebuff, but appears to enjoydiscoursing in a sentimental way upon his disappointment. He wears suchan air of meek resignation when he speaks of his cruel fair one that theeffect is quite irresistible, and I find it difficult to accord himthat sympathy which his unhappy fate demands. Fortunately for him, histroubles, deep-seated as they are, appear to have very little effectupon his appetite. He sits down to his rations with a look of subduedsorrow upon his face, and sighs frequently between the mouthfuls. Inspite of this, however, he seldom leaves anything upon his tin plate,which speaks well for his appetite, since Uncle Sam is a generousprovider, and few of us do full justice to our allowance.""You may wonder how I enjoy soldier\'s fare. I certainly do longsometimes for the good pumpkin and apple pies which I used to have athome, and confess that a little apple sauce would make my hardtacka little more savory. I begin to appreciate your good qualities as ahousekeeper, Mary, more than ever. Pies can be got of the sutler, butthey are such poor things that I would rather do without than eat them,and I am quite sure they would try my digestion sorely.""There is one very homely esculent which we crave in the camp--I meanthe onion. It is an excellent preventive of scurvy, a disease to whichour mode of living particularly exposes us. We eat as many as we canget, and should be glad of more. Tell Frank he may plant a whole acre ofthem. They will require considerable care, but even in a pecuniary waythey will pay. The price has considerably advanced since the war began,on account of the large army demand, and will doubtless increase more.""As to our military exercises, drill, etc., we have enough to occupyour time well. I see the advantage of enlisting in a veteran regiment.I find myself improving very rapidly. Besides my public company drill,I am getting my young comrade, Frank Grover, who has been in the servicesix months, to give me some private lessons. With the help of these, Ihope to pass muster creditably before my first month is out.""And now, my dear Mary, I must draw my letter to a close. In the armywe are obliged to write under difficulties. I am writing this on myknapsack for a desk, and that is not quite so easy as a table. Theconstrained position in which I am forced to sit has tired me, and Ithink I will go out and \'limber\' myself a little. Frank, who has justfinished a letter to his mother, will no doubt join me. Two of mycomrades are sitting close by, playing euchre. When I joined them Ifound they were in the habit of playing for small stakes, but I havesucceeded in inducing them to give up a practice which might notunlikely lead to bad results.""In closing, I need not tell you how much and how often I think of youall. I have never before been separated from you, and there are timeswhen my longing to be with you again is very strong. You must make upfor your absence by frequent and long letters. Tell me all that is goingon. Even trifles will serve to amuse us here.""Tell Frank to send me Harper\'s Weekly regularly. Two or three times aweek I should like to have a daily paper forwarded. Every newspaper thatfinds its way into camp goes the rounds, and its contents are eagerlydevoured.""I will write you again very soon. The letters I write and receive fromhome will be one of my principal sources of pleasure. God bless you all,is the prayer of your affectionate husband and father,""HENRY FROST.""It is hardly necessary to say that this letter was read with eagerinterest. That evening all the children, including little Charlie, werebusy writing letters to the absent father. I have not room to print themall, but as this was Charlie\'s first epistolary effort, it may interestsome of my youthful readers to see it. The mistakes in spelling will beexcused on the score of Charlie\'s literary inexperience. This is the wayit commenced:""DEER FARTHER: I am sorry you hav to live in a log hous stuck up withmud. I shud think the mud wood cum off on your close. I am wel and so isMaggie. Frank is agoin to make me a sled--a real good one. I shal cal itthe egle. I hope we shal soon hav sum sno. It will be my berth day nextweek. I shal be seven years old. I hope you cum back soon. Good nite.""from CHARLIE.""Charlie was so proud of his letter that he insisted on having itenclosed in a separate envelope and mailed by itself--a request whichwas complied with by his mother.']"
86,14,Chapter 14,"['XIII. MISCHIEF ON FOOTAs may be supposed, John Haynes was deeply incensed with Frank Frost forthe manner in which he had foiled him in his attack upon Pomp. He feltthat in this whole matter he had appeared by no means to advantage.After all his boasting, he had been defeated by a boy younger andsmaller than himself. The old grudge which he had against Frank for thesuccess gained over him at school increased and added poignancy to hismortification. He felt that he should never be satisfied until he had""come up"" with Frank in some way. The prospect of seeing him ejectedfrom the farm was pleasant, but it was too far off. John did not feellike waiting so long for the gratification of his revengeful feelings.He resolved in the meantime to devise some method of injuring orannoying Frank.He could not at once think of anything feasible. Several schemes flittedacross his mind, but all were open to some objection. John did not careto attempt anything which would expose him, if discovered, to a legalpunishment. I am afraid this weighed more with him than the wrong orinjustice of his schemes.At last it occurred to him that Mr. Frost kept a couple of pigs. To letthem out secretly at night would be annoying to Frank, as they wouldprobably stray quite a distance, and thus a tedious pursuit would bemade necessary. Perhaps they might never be found, in which case Johnfelt that he should not grieve much.Upon this scheme John finally settled as the one promising the mostamusement to himself and annoyance to his enemy, as he chose to regardFrank. He felt quite averse, however, to doing the work himself. In thefirst place, it must be done by night, and he could not absent himselffrom the house at a late hour without his father\'s knowledge. Again, heknew there was a risk of being caught, and it would not sound very wellif noised abroad that the son of Squire Haynes had gone out by night andlet loose a neighbor\'s pigs.He cast about in his mind for a confederate, and after awhile settledupon a boy named Dick Bumstead.This Dick had the reputation of being a scape-grace and a ne\'er-do-well.He was about the age of John Haynes, but had not attended school fora couple of years, and, less from want of natural capacity than fromindolence, knew scarcely more than a boy of ten. His father was ashoemaker, and had felt obliged to keep his son at home to assist himin the shop. He did not prove a very efficient assistant, however, beinginclined to shirk duty whenever he could.It was upon this boy that John Haynes fixed as most likely to help himin his plot. On his way home from school the next afternoon, he noticedDick loitering along a little in advance.""Hold on, Dick,"" he called out, in a friendly voice, at the same timequickening his pace.Dick turned in some surprise, for John Haynes had a foolish pride, whichhad hitherto kept him very distant toward those whom he regarded asstanding lower than himself in the social scale.""How are you, John?"" he responded, putting up the knife with which hehad been whittling.""All right. What are you up to nowadays?""""Working in the shop,"" said Dick, shrugging his shoulders. ""I wishpeople didn\'t wear shoes, for my part. I\'ve helped make my share.Pegging isn\'t a very interesting operation.""""No,"" said John, with remarkable affability. ""I shouldn\'t think there\'dbe much fun in it.""""Fun! I guess not. For my part, I\'d be willing to go barefoot, if otherpeople would, for the sake of getting rid of pegging.""""I suppose you have some time to yourself, though, don\'t you?""""Precious little. I ought to be in the shop now. Father sent me down tothe store for some awls, and he\'ll be fretting because I don\'t get back.I broke my awl on purpose,"" said Dick, laughing, ""so as to get a chanceto run out a little while.""""I suppose your father gives you some of the money that you earn,doesn\'t he?\' inquired John.""A few cents now and then; that\'s all. He says everything is so highnowadays that it takes all we can both of us earn to buy food andclothes. So if a fellow wants a few cents now and then to buy a cigar,he can\'t have \'em.""John was glad to hear this. He felt that he could the more readilyinduce Dick to assist him in his plans.""Dick!"" he said abruptly, looking round to see that no one was withinhearing-distance, ""wouldn\'t you like to earn a two-dollar bill?""""For myself?"" inquired Dick.""Certainly.""""Is there much work in it?"" asked indolent Dick cautiously.""No, and what little there is will be fun.""""Then I\'m in for it. That is, I think I am. What is it?""""You\'ll promise not to tell?"" said John.""Honor bright.""""It\'s only a little practical joke that I want to play upon one of theboys.""""On who?"" asked Dick, unmindful of his grammar.""On Frank Frost.""""Frank\'s a pretty good fellow. It isn\'t going to hurt him any, is it?""""Oh, no, of course not.""""Because I wouldn\'t want to do that. He\'s always treated me well.""""Of course he has. It\'s only a little joke, you know.""""Oh, well, if it\'s a joke, just count me in. Fire away, and let me knowwhat you want done.""""You know that Frank, or his father, keeps pigs?""""Yes.""""I want you to go some night--the sooner the better--and let them out,so that when morning comes the pigs will be minus, and Master Frank willhave a fine chase after them.""""Seems to me,"" said Dick, ""that won\'t be much of a joke.""""Then I guess you never saw a pig-chase. Pigs are so contrary that ifyou want them to go in one direction they are sure to go in another.The way they gallop over the ground, with their little tails wrigglingbehind them, is a caution.""""But it would be a great trouble to Frank to get them back.""""Oh, well, you could help him, and so get still more fun out of it, henot knowing, of course, that you had anything to do with letting themout.""""And that would take me out of the shop for a couple of hours,"" saidDick, brightening at the thought.""Of course,"" said John; ""so you would get a double advantage. Come, whatdo you say?""""Well, I don\'t know,"" said Dick, wavering. ""You\'d pay me the money downon the nail, wouldn\'t you?""""Yes,"" said John. ""I\'ll show you the bill now.""He took from his pocketbook a two-dollar greenback, and displayed it toDick.""You could buy cigars enough with this to last you some time,"" he saidinsinuatingly.""So I could. I declare, I\'ve a good mind to take up your offer.""""You\'d better. It\'s a good one.""""But why don\'t you do it yourself?"" asked Dick, with sudden wonder.""Because father\'s very strict,"" said John glibly, ""and if I should leavethe house at night, he\'d be sure to find it out.""""That\'s where I have the advantage. I sleep downstairs, and can easilyslip out of the window, without anybody\'s being the wiser.""""Just the thing. Then you agree?""""Yes, I might as well. Are you particular about the night?""""No, take your choice about that. Only the sooner the better.""The two boys separated, John feeling quite elated with his success.']"
86,15,Chapter 15,"['XIV. A RAID UPON THE PIG-PENThe more Dick thought of the enterprise which he had undertaken, themore he disliked it. He relished fun as much as any one, but he couldnot conceal from himself that he would be subjecting Frank to a greatdeal of trouble and annoyance. As he had told John, Frank had alwaystreated him well, and this thought made the scheme disagreeable to him.Still, John had promised him two dollars for his co-operation, and this,in his circumstances, was an important consideration. Unfortunately,Dick had contracted a fondness for smoking--a habit which his scantysupply of pocket-money rarely enabled him to indulge. This windfallwould keep him in cigars for some time. It was this reflection whichfinally turned the wavering scale of Dick\'s irresolution, and determinedhim to embrace John\'s offer.The moon was now at the full, and the nights were bright and beautiful.Dick decided that it would be best to defer the accomplishment of hispurpose till later in the month, when darker nights would serve as ascreen, and render detection more difficult.By and by a night came which he thought suitable. A few stars wereout, but they gave only a faint glimmer of light, not more than wasnecessary.Dick went to bed at nine o\'clock, as usual. By an effort he succeeded inkeeping awake, feeling that if he once yielded to drowsiness, he shouldprobably sleep on till morning. At half-past nine all in the house wereabed. It was not till eleven, however, that Dick felt it safe to leavethe house. He dressed himself expeditiously and in silence, occasionallylistening to see if he could detect any sound in the room above, wherehis parents slept. Finally he raised the window softly, and jumped out.He crept out to the road, and swiftly bent his steps toward Mr. Frost\'shouse.As this was not more than a third of a mile distant, a very few minutessufficed to bring him to his destination. Dick\'s feelings were not themost comfortable. Though he repeatedly assured himself that it was onlyfun he was engaged in, he felt very much like a burglar about to enter ahouse.Arrived before the farmhouse, he looked cautiously up to the windows,but could see no light burning.""The coast is clear,"" he thought. ""I wish it were all over, and I wereon my way home.""Dick had not reconnoitered thoroughly. There was a light burning in awindow at the other end of the house.The pig-pen was a small, rough, unpainted building, with a yard openingfrom it. Around the yard was a stone wall, which prevented the pigs frommaking their escape. They were now, as Dick could with difficulty see,stretched out upon the floor of the pen, asleep.Dick proceeded to remove a portion of the stones forming the wall. Itwas not very easy or agreeable work, the stones being large and heavy.At length he effected a gap which he thought would be large enough forthe pigs to pass through. He next considered whether it would be betterto disturb the slumbers of the pigs by poking them with a hoe, or waitand let them find out the avenue of escape in the morning. He finallydecided to stir them up. He accordingly went round to the door and,seizing a hoe, commenced punching one of the pigs vigorously.The pig whose slumbers were thus rudely disturbed awoke with a loudgrunt, and probably would have looked astonished and indignant if naturehad given him the power of expressing such emotions.""Get out, there, you lazy beast,"" exclaimed Dick.The pig, as was perhaps only natural under the circumstances, seemedreluctant to get up, and was by no means backward in grunting hisdiscontent. Dick was earnestly engaged in overcoming his repugnance tolocomotion, when he was startled by hearing the door of the building,which he had carefully closed, open slowly. Looking up hastily, the hoestill in his hand, his dismayed glance fell upon Frank Frost, enteringwith a lantern.A half-exclamation of surprise and dismay escaped him. This called theattention of Frank, who till that moment was unsuspicious of Dick\'spresence.""Dick Bumstead!"" he exclaimed, as soon as he recognized the intruder.""What brings you here at this time of night?""""A mean errand, Frank,"" returned Dick, with a wholesome feeling ofshame. He had made up his mind to a confession.""You didn\'t come here to--to----"" Here Frank stopped short.""No, not to steal. I ain\'t quite so mean as that comes to. I come to letout your pigs, so that in the morning you would have a long chase afterthem.""""But what could put such a thing into your head, Dick?"" asked Frank, ingreat surprise.""I thought it would be a good joke.""""It wouldn\'t have been much of a joke to me,"" said Frank.""No; and to tell the truth it wouldn\'t have been to me. The fact is,and I don\'t mind telling it, that I should never have thought of such athing if somebody else hadn\'t put it into my head.""""Somebody else?""""Yes; I\'d a little rather not tell who that somebody is, for I don\'tbelieve he would like to have you know.""""Why didn\'t he come himself?"" asked Frank. ""It seems to me he\'s beenmaking a catspaw of you.""""A catspaw?""""Yes, haven\'t you read the story? A monkey wanted to draw some chestnutsout of the hot ashes, but, feeling a decided objection to burning hisown paws in the operation, drew a cat to the fire and thrust her pawin.""""I don\'t know but it\'s been so in my case,"" said Dick. ""I didn\'t want todo it, and that\'s a fact. I felt as mean as could be when I first cameinto your yard to-night. But he offered me two dollars to do it, andit\'s so seldom I see money that it tempted me.""Frank looked puzzled. ""I don\'t see,"" he said thoughtfully, ""how anybodyshould think it worth while to pay two dollars for such a piece ofmischief.""""Perhaps he don\'t like you, and wanted to plague you,"" suggested Dick.The thought at once flashed upon Frank that John Haynes must beimplicated. He was the only boy who was likely to have two dollarsto invest in this way, and the suggestion offered by Dick of personalenmity was sufficient to supply a motive for his action.""I believe I know who it is, now, Dick,"" he said quietly. ""However, Iwon\'t ask you to tell me. There is one boy in the village who thinkshe has cause of complaint against me, though I have never intentionallyinjured him.""""What shall you do about it, Frank?"" asked Dick, a little awkwardly, forhe did not want his own agency made public.""Nothing,"" answered Frank. ""I would rather take no notice of it.""""At any rate, I hope you won\'t think hard of me,"" said Dick. ""You havealways treated me well, and I didn\'t want to trouble you. But the moneytempted me. I meant to buy cigars with it.""""You don\'t smoke, Dick?""""Yes, when I get a chance.""""I wouldn\'t if I were you. It isn\'t good for boys like you and me. It isan expensive habit, and injurious, too.""""I don\'t know but you are right, Frank,"" said Dick candidly.""I know I am. You can leave off now, Dick, better than when you areolder.""At this moment a voice was heard from the house, calling ""Frank!""""I came out for some herbs,"" said Frank hurriedly. ""Jacob isn\'t verywell, and mother is going to make him some herb tea. I won\'t mentionthat I have seen you.""""All right. Thank you, Frank.""A minute later Frank went into the house, leaving Dick by himself.""Now,"" thought Dick, ""I must try to remedy the mischief I have done. I\'mafraid I\'ve got a job before me.""He went round to the gap in the wall, and began to lay it again as wellas he could. In lifting the heavy stones he began to realize how mucheasier it is to make mischief than to repair damages afterward. Hepulled and tugged, but it took him a good half-hour, and by that time hefelt very tired.""My clothes must be precious dirty,"" he said to himself. ""At any rate,my hands are. I wonder where the pump is. But then it won\'t do to pump;it\'ll make too much noise. Oh, here\'s some water in the trough.""Dick succeeded in getting some of the dirt off his hands, which he driedon his handkerchief. Then with a feeling of relief, he took the roadtoward home.Although he may be said to have failed most signally in his design, hefelt considerably better than if he had succeeded.""Frank\'s a good fellow,"" he said to himself. ""Some boys would have beenmad, and made a great fuss. But he didn\'t seem angry at all, not evenwith John Haynes, and did all he could to screen me. Well I\'m glad Ididn\'t succeed.""Dick reached home without any further mischance, and succeeded incrawling in at the window without making any sound loud enough to wakeup his parents.The next day John, who had been informed of his intention to make theattempt the evening previous, contrived to meet him.""Well, Dick,"" he said eagerly, ""what success last night?""""None at all,"" answered Dick.""Didn\'t you try?""""Yes.""""What prevented your succeeding, then?""""Frank came out to get some herbs to make tea for the hired man, and socaught me.""""You didn\'t tell him who put you up to it?"" said John apprehensively.""No,"" said Dick coolly; ""I don\'t do such things.""""That\'s good,"" said John, relieved. ""Was he mad?""""No, he didn\'t make any fuss. He asked what made me do it, and I toldhim somebody else put it into my head.""""You did! I thought you said you didn\'t.""""I didn\'t tell who that somebody was, but Frank said he could guess.""""He can\'t prove it,"" said John hastily.""I don\'t think he\'ll try,"" said Dick. ""The fact is, John, Frank\'s a goodfellow, and if you want to get anybody to do him any mischief hereafter,you\'d better not apply to me.""""I don\'t know as he\'s any better than other boys,"" said John, sneering.He did not enjoy hearing Frank\'s praises.""He\'s better than either of us, I\'m sure of that,"" said Dick decidedly.""Speak for yourself, Dick Bumstead,"" said John haughtily. ""I wouldn\'tlower myself by a comparison with him. He\'s only a laborer, and willgrow up a clodhopper.""""He\'s my friend, John Haynes,"" said Dick stoutly, ""and if you\'ve gotanything else to say against him, you\'ll oblige me by going fartheroff.""John left in high dudgeon.That day, to his father\'s surprise, Dick worked with steady industry,and did not make a single attempt to shirk.']"
86,16,Chapter 16,"['XV. POMP BEHAVES BADLYThe village of Rossville was distant about five miles from the long lineof railway which binds together with iron bands the cities of NewYork and Boston. Only when the wind was strongly that way could themonotonous noise of the railway-train be heard, as the iron monster,with its heavy burden, sped swiftly on its way.Lately a covered wagon had commenced running twice a day betweenRossville and the railway-station at Wellington. It was started at sevenin the morning, in time to meet the early trains, and again at four,in order to receive any passengers who might have left the city in theafternoon.Occupying a central position in the village stood the tavern--atwo-story building, with a long piazza running along the front. Herean extended seat was provided, on which, when the weather was not tooinclement, the floating population of the village, who had plenty ofleisure, and others when their work was over for the day, liked tocongregate, and in neighborly chat discuss the affairs of the village,or the nation, speculating perchance upon the varying phases of thegreat civil contest, which, though raging hundreds of miles away,came home to the hearts and hearths of quiet Rossville and every othervillage and hamlet in the land.The driver of the carriage which made its daily journeys to and fro fromthe station had received from his parents the rather uncommon name ofAjax, not probably from any supposed resemblance to the ancient Grecianhero, of whom it is doubtful whether his worthy progenitor had everheard. He had been at one time a driver on a horse-car in New York,but had managed to find his way from the busy hum of the city to quietRossville, where he was just in time for an employment similar to theone he had given up.One day, early in November, a young man of slight figure, apparentlynot far from twenty-five years of age, descended from the cars at theWellington station and, crossing the track, passed through the smallstation-house to the rear platform.""Can you tell me,"" he inquired of a bystander, ""whether there is anyconveyance between this place and Rossville?""""Yes, sir,"" was the reply. ""That\'s the regular carriage, and here\'s thedriver. Ajax, here\'s a passenger for you.""""I have a trunk on the other side,"" said the young man, addressing thedriver. ""If you wild go round with me, we will bring it here.""""All right, sir,"" said Ajax, in a businesslike way.The trunk was brought round and placed on the rack behind the wagon.It was a large black trunk, securely bound with brass bands, and showedmarks of service, as if it had been considerably used. Two small stripsof paper pasted on the side bore the custom-house marks of Havre andLiverpool. On one end was a large card, on which, written in large, boldletters, was the name of the proprietor, Henry Morton.In five minutes the ""express"" got under way. The road wound partlythrough the woods. In some places the boughs, bending over from oppositesides, nearly met. At present the branches were nearly destitute ofleaves, and the landscape looked bleak. But in the summer nothing couldbe more charming.From his seat, beside Ajax, Henry Morton regarded attentively theprominent features of the landscape. His survey was interrupted by aquestion from the driver.""Are you calc\'latin\' to make a long stay in our village?"" inquired Ajax,with Yankee freedom.""I am not quite certain. It is possible that I may.""""There isn\'t much goin\' on in winter.""""No, I suppose not.""After a few minutes\' pause, he inquired, ""Can you tell me if there is agentleman living in the village named Haynes?""""I expect you mean Squire Haynes,"" said Ajax.""Very probably he goes by that name. He was formerly a lawyer.""""Yes, that\'s the man. Do you know him?""""I have heard of him,"" said the young man, non-committally.""Then you ain\'t going to stop there?""An expression of repugnance swept over the young man\'s face, as hehastily answered in the negative.By this time they had come to a turn in the road. This brought them inview of Chloe\'s cottage. Little Pomp was on all fours, hunting for nutsamong the fallen leaves under the shagbark-tree.Under the influence of some freakish impulse, Pomp suddenly jumped tohis feet and, whirling his arms aloft, uttered a wild whoop. Startledby the unexpected apparition, the horses gave a sudden start, and nearlysucceeded in overturning the wagon.""Massy on us!"" exclaimed an old lady on the back seat, suddenly flingingher arms round young Morton\'s neck, in the height of her consternation.""All right, marm,"" said Ajax reassuringly, after a brief but successfulconflict with the horses. ""We sha\'n\'t go over this time. I should liketo give that little black imp a good shaking.""""Oh, I\'ve lost my ban\'box, with my best bunnit,"" hastily exclaimed theold lady. ""Le\' me get out and find it. It was a present from my darter,Cynthy Ann, and I wouldn\'t lose it for a kingdom.""In truth, when prompted by her apprehension to cling to the young man infront for protection, Mrs. Payson had inadvertently dropped the bandboxout of the window, where it met with an unhappy disaster. The horse,quite unconscious of the damage he was doing, had backed the wagon insuch a manner that one of the wheels passed directly over it.When Ajax picked up the mutilated casket, which, with the jewel itcontained, had suffered such irreparable injury, and restored it to itsowner, great was the lamentation. Rachel weeping for her children couldhardly have exhibited more poignant sorrow.""Oh, it\'s sp\'ilt!"" groaned the old lady. ""I can never wear it arterthis. And it cost four dollars and sixty-two cents and a half withoutthe ribbon. Oh, deary me!""Then, suddenly waxing indignant with the author of the mischief, she puther head out of the window, and, espying Pomp on the other side of thestone wall, looking half-repentant and half-struck with the fun of thething, she shook her fist at him, exclaiming, ""Oh, you little sarpint,ef I only had you here, I\'d w\'ip you till you couldn\'t stan\'.""Pomp was so far from being terrified by this menace that he burst into aloud guffaw. This, of course, added fuel to the flame of the old lady\'swrath, and filled her with thoughts of immediate vengeance. Her sympathywith the oppressed black race was at that moment very small.""Jest lend me your w\'ip, driver,"" said she, ""an\' I\'ll l\'arn that sassyimp to make fun of his elders.""Ajax, whose sense of humor was tickled by the old lady\'s peculiarities,quietly took her at her word, and coming round to the side opened thedoor of the carriage.""There, ma\'am,"" said he, extending the whip. ""Don\'t spare him. Hedeserves a flogging.""Mrs. Payson, her eyes flashing from beneath her glasses with a vengefullight, seized the proffered whip with alacrity, and jumped out of thewagon with a lightness which could hardly have been anticipated of oneof her age.""Now, look out,"" she said, brandishing the whip in a menacing way. ""I\'llgit pay for that bunnit in one way, ef I don\'t in another.""Pomp maintained his position on the other side of the wall. He waitedtill the old lady was fairly over, and then commenced running. Theold lady pursued with vindictive animosity, cracking the whip in asuggestive manner. Pomp doubled and turned in a most provoking way.Finally he had recourse to a piece of strategy. He had flung himself,doubled up in a ball, at the old lady\'s feet, and she, unable to checkher speed, fell over him, clutching at the ground with her outstretchedhands, from which the whip had fallen.""Hi, hi!"" shrieked Pomp, with a yell of inconceivable delight, as hewatched the signal downfall of his adversary. Springing quickly to hisfeet, he ran swiftly away.""Good for you, you old debble!"" he cried from a safe distance.Henry Morton, though he found it difficult to restrain his laughter,turned to Ajax and said, ""I think it\'s time we interfered. If you\'llovertake the little black boy and give him a shaking up, just to keephim out of mischief hereafter, I\'ll go and help the old lady.""Ajax started on his errand. Pomp, now really alarmed, strove to escapefrom this more formidable adversary, but in vain. He was destined toreceive a summary castigation.Meanwhile, the young man approached Mrs. Payson.""I hope you\'re not much hurt, madam,"" said he respectfully.""I expect about every bone in my body\'s broke,"" she groaned.Raising her to her feet, it became manifest that the damage was limitedto a pair of hands begrimed by contact with the earth. Nevertheless, theold lady persisted that ""something or \'nother was broke. She didn\'t feelquite right inside.""""I shouldn\'t keer so much,"" she added, ""ef I\'d caught that aggravatin\'boy. I\'d go fifty miles to see him hung. He\'ll die on the gallows, jestas sure\'s I stan\' here.""At this moment a shrill cry was heard, which could proceed from no onebut Pomp.""Golly, Mass\' Jack, don\'t hit so hard. Couldn\'t help it, sure.""""You\'ll have to help it the next time, you little rascal!"" respondedAjax.""Le\' me go. I hope to be killed if I ever do it ag\'in,"" pleaded Pomp,dancing about in pain.""I hope you gin it to him,"" said the old lady, as the driver reappeared.Ajax smiled grimly. ""I touched him up a little,"" he said.""Oh, my poor bunnit!"" groaned Mrs. Payson, once more, as her eyes fellupon the crushed article. ""What will Cynthy Ann say?""""Perhaps a milliner can restore it for you,"" suggested Henry Morton,with an attempt at consolation.The old lady shook her head disconsolately. ""It\'s all jammed out ofshape,"" she said dismally, ""an\' the flowers is all mashed up. Looks asef an elephant had trodden on to it.""""As you are the only one of us that has suffered,"" said the young manpolitely, ""I think it only fair that your loss should be lightened. Willyou accept this toward making it good?""He drew from his portemonnaie a five-dollar greenback, as he spoke, andoffered it to Mrs. Payson.""Are you in airnest?"" inquired the old lady dubiously.""Quite so.""""You ain\'t robbin\' yourself, be you?"" asked Mrs. Payson, with a look ofsubdued eagerness lighting up her wrinkled face.""Oh, no; I can spare it perfectly well.""""Then I\'ll take it,"" she responded, in evident gratification, ""an\'I\'m sure I\'m much obleeged to you. I\'m free to confess that you\'re agentleman sech as I don\'t often meet with. I wouldn\'t take it on noaccount, only the loss is considerable for me, and Cynthy Ann, she wouldhave been disapp\'inted if so be as I hadn\'t worn the bunnit. I\'d like toknow who it is that I\'m so much obligated to.""Henry Morton drew a card from his card-case and handed it with a bow toMrs. Payson.""What\'s that?"" asked the old lady.""My card.""""Le\'s see, where\'s my specs?"" said Mrs. Payson, fumbling in her pocket.""Oh, I\'ve got \'em on. So your name\'s Herod. What made \'em call youthat?""""Henry, madam--Henry Morton.""""Well, so \'tis, I declare. You ain\'t related to Nahum Morton, of Gilead,be you; he that was put into the State\'s prison for breakin\' open theGilead Bank?""An amused smile overspread the young man\'s face.""I never had any relatives sent to the State\'s prison,"" he answered;""though I think it quite possible that some of them may have deservedit.""""Jest so,"" assented the old lady. ""There\'s a good deal of iniquity thatnever comes to light. I once know\'d a woman that killed her husbandwith the tongs, and nobody ever surmised it; though everybody thoughtit strange that he should disappear so suddint. Well, this woman on herdeath-bed owned up to the tongs in a crazy fit that she had. But themost cur\'us part of it,"" the old lady added rather illogically, ""was,that the man was livin\' all the while, and it was all his wife\'s fancythat she\'d struck him with the tongs.""By this time the ""express"" had rumbled into the main street ofRossville, and the old lady had hardly completed her strikingillustration of the truth, that murder will out, before they had drawnup in front of the tavern.""Ain\'t you a-goin\' to carry me to my darter\'s house?"" she inquired withsolicitude. ""I can\'t walk noway.""""Yes, ma\'am,"" answered Ajax, ""directly, just as soon as this gentleman\'sgot out, and they\'ve taken the mail.""He tossed the mail-bag to a small boy who stood on the piazza in waitingto receive it, and then, whipping up his horses, speedily conveyed Mrs.Payson to her destination.""He\'s a very nice, obleeging young man,"" said the old lady, referringto Henry Morton. ""I wonder ef his mother was a Bent. There\'s old MicajahBent\'s third daughter, Roxana Jane, married a Morton, or it might havebeen a Moulton. Ever see him afore?""""No, ma\'am. Here you are.""""So I be! and there\'s Reuben at the gate. How are ye all? Jest take thiscarpetbag, will ye, and I\'ll give you a cent some time or \'nother.""Reuben did not appear much elated by this promise. It had been made toomany times without fulfilment.The old lady having reached her destination, we take leave of herfor the present, promising to resume her acquaintance in subsequentchapters.']"
86,17,Chapter 17,"['XVI. FRANK MAKES A FRIENDHenry Morton rose with the sun. This was not so early as may besupposed, for already November had touched its middle point, and thetardy sun did not make its appearance till nearly seven o\'clock. As hepassed through the hall he noticed that breakfast was not quite ready.""A little walk will sharpen my appetite,"" he thought. He put on his hat,and, passing through the stable-yard at the rear, climbed over a fenceand ascended a hill which he had observed from his chamber window.The sloping sides, which had not yet wholly lost their appearance ofverdure, were dotted with trees, mostly apple-trees.""It must be delightful in summer,"" said the young man, as he lookedthoughtfully about him.The hill was by no means high, and five minutes\' walk brought him to thesummit. From this spot he had a fine view of the village which lay athis feet embowered in trees. A narrow river wound like a silver threadthrough the landscape. Groups of trees on either bank bent over as ifto see themselves reflected in the rapid stream. At one point a dam hadbeen built across from bank to bank, above which the river widened anddeepened, affording an excellent skating-ground for the boys in the colddays of December and January. A whirring noise was heard. The grist-millhad just commenced its work for the day. Down below the dam the shallowwater eddied and whirled, breaking in fleecy foam over protuberant rockswhich lay in the river-bed.The old village church with its modest proportions occupied a knollbetween the hill and the river. It was girdled about with firsintermingled with elms. Near-by was a small triangular common, thicklyplanted with trees, each facing a separate street. Houses clustered hereand there. Comfortable buildings they were, but built evidently ratherfor use than show. The architect had not yet come to the assistance ofthe village carpenter.Seen in the cheering light of the rising sun, Henry Morton could nothelp feeling that a beautiful picture was spread out before him.""After all,"" he said thoughtfully, ""we needn\'t go abroad for beauty,when we can find so much of it at our own doors. Yet, perhaps the morewe see of the beautiful, the better we are fitted to appreciate it inthe wonderful variety of its numberless forms.""He slowly descended the hill, but in a different direction. This broughthim to the road that connected the village with North Rossville, twomiles distant.Coming from a different direction, a boy reached the stile about thesame time with himself, and both clambered over together.""It is a beautiful morning,"" said the young man courteously.""Yes, sir,"" was the respectful answer. ""Have you been up looking at theview?""""Yes--and to get an appetite for breakfast. And you?""Frank Frost--for it was he--laughed. ""Oh, I am here on quite a differenterrand,"" he said. ""I used to come here earlier in the season to drivethe cows to pasture. I come this morning to carry some milk to aneighbor who takes it of us. She usually sends for it, but her son isjust now sick with the measles.""""Yet I think you cannot fail to enjoy the pleasant morning, even if youare here for other purposes.""""I do enjoy it very much,"" said Frank. ""When I read of beautiful sceneryin other countries, I always wish that I could visit them, and see formyself.""""Perhaps you will some day.""Frank smiled, and shook his head incredulously. ""I am afraid there isnot much chance of it,"" he said.""So I thought when I was of your age,"" returned Henry Morton.""Then you have traveled?"" said Frank, looking interested.""Yes. I have visited most of the countries of Europe.""""Have you been in Rome?"" inquired Frank.""Yes. Are you interested in Rome?""""Who could help it, sir? I should like to see the Capitol, and the ViaSacra, and the Tarpeian Rock, and the Forum--and, in fact, Rome must befull of objects of interest. Who knows but I might tread where Cicero,and Virgil, and Caesar had trodden before me?""Henry Morton looked at the boy who stood beside him with increasedinterest. ""I see you are quite a scholar,"" he said. ""Where did you learnabout all these men and places?""""I have partly prepared for college,"" answered Frank; ""but my fatherwent to the war some weeks since, and I am staying at home to takecharge of the farm, and supply his place as well as I can.""""It must have been quite a sacrifice to you to give up your studies?""said his companion.""Yes, sir, it was a great sacrifice; but we must all of us sacrificesomething in these times. Even the boys can do something for theircountry.""""What is your name?"" asked Henry Morton, more and more pleased with hischance acquaintance. ""I should like to become better acquainted withyou.""Frank blushed, and his expressive face showed that he was gratified bythe compliment.""My name is Frank Frost,"" he answered, ""and I live about half a milefrom here.""""And I am Henry Morton. I am stopping temporarily at the hotel. Shallyou be at leisure this evening, Frank?""""Yes, sir.""""Then I should be glad to receive a call from you. I have noacquaintances, and perhaps we may help each other to make the eveningpass pleasantly. I have some pictures collected abroad, which I thinkyou might like to look at.""""I shall be delighted to come,"" said Frank, his eyes sparkling withpleasure.By this time they had reached the church, which was distant but a fewrods from the hotel. They had just turned the corner of the road, whenthe clang of a bell was heard.""I suppose that is my breakfast-bell,"" said the young man. ""It finds mewith a good appetite. Good morning, Frank. I will expect you, then, thisevening.""Frank returned home, feeling quite pleased with his invitation.""I wish,"" thought he, ""that I might see considerable of Mr. Morton. Icould learn a great deal from him, he has seen so much.""His road led him past the house of Squire Haynes. John was saunteringabout the yard with his hands in his pockets.""Good morning, John,"" said Frank, in a pleasant voice.John did not seem inclined to respond to this politeness. On seeingFrank he scowled, and without deigning to make a reply turned his backand went into the house. He had not forgotten the last occasion on whichthey had met in the woods, when Frank defeated his cruel designs uponpoor Pomp. There was not much likelihood that he would forget it verysoon.""I can\'t understand John,"" thought Frank. ""The other boys will get madand get over it before the next day; John broods over it for weeks.I really believe he hates me. But, of course, I couldn\'t act anydifferently. I wasn\'t going to stand by and see Pomp beaten. I should dojust the same again.""The day wore away, and in the evening Frank presented himself at thehotel, and inquired for Mr. Morton. He was ushered upstairs, and told toknock at the door of a room in the second story.His knock was answered by the young man in person, who shook his handwith a pleasant smile, and invited him in.""I am glad to see you, Frank,"" he said, very cordially.""And I am much obliged to you for inviting me, Mr. Morton.""They sat down together beside the table, and conversed on a variety oftopics. Frank had numberless questions to ask about foreign scenes andcountries, all of which were answered with the utmost readiness. HenryMorton brought out a large portfolio containing various pictures, someon note-paper, representing scenes in different parts of Europe.The evening wore away only too rapidly for Frank. He had seldompassed two hours so pleasantly. At half-past nine, he rose, and saidhalf-regretfully, ""I wish you were going to live in the village thiswinter, Mr. Morton.""The young man smiled. ""Such is my intention, Frank,"" he said quietly.""Shall you stay?"" said Frank joyfully. ""I suppose you will board here?""""I should prefer a quieter boarding-place. Can you recommend one?""Frank hesitated.""Where,"" continued Mr. Morton, ""I could enjoy the companionship of anintelligent young gentleman of your age?""""If we lived nearer the village,"" Frank began, and stopped abruptly.""Half a mile would be no objection to me. As I don\'t think you will findit unpleasant, Frank, I will authorize you to offer your mother fivedollars a week for a room and a seat at her table.""""I am quite sure she would be willing, Mr. Morton, but I am afraid weshould not live well enough to suit you. And I don\'t think you ought topay so much as five dollars a week.""""Leave that to me, Frank. My main object is to obtain a pleasant home;and that I am sure I should find at your house.""""Thank you, sir,"" said Frank; ""I will mention it to my mother, and letyou know in the course of to-morrow.""']"
86,18,Chapter 18,"['XVII. A SHADE OF MYSTERYFrank found little difficulty in persuading his mother to accept youngMorton\'s proposition. From her son\'s description she felt little doubtthat he would be a pleasant addition to the family circle, while hisfund of information would make him instructive as well as agreeable.There was another consideration besides which determined her to takehim. Five dollars a week would go a great way in housekeeping, or,rather, as their income from other sources would probably be sufficientfor this, she could lay aside the entire amount toward paying themortgage held by Squire Haynes. This plan occurred simultaneously toFrank and his mother.""I should certainly feel myself to blame if I neglected so good anopportunity of helping your father,"" said Mrs. Frost.""Suppose we don\'t tell him, mother,"" suggested Frank; ""but when he getshome surprise him with the amount of our savings.""""No,"" said Mrs. Frost, after a moment\'s thought, ""your father will beall the better for all the good news we can send him. It will make hislife more tolerable.""Frank harnessed his horse to a light wagon and drove down to the tavern.Henry Morton was sitting on the piazza, as the day was unusually-warm,with a book in his hand.""Well,"" he said, looking up with a smile, ""I hope you have come for me.""""That is my errand, Mr. Morton,"" answered Frank. ""If your trunk isalready packed, we will take it along with us.""""It is quite ready. If you will come up and help me downstairs with it,I will settle with the landlord and leave at once.""This was speedily arranged, and the young man soon occupied a seatbeside Frank.Arrived at the farmhouse, Frank introduced the new boarder to hismother.""I hope we shall be able to make you comfortable,"" said Mrs. Frost, in ahospitable tone.""I entertain no doubt of it,"" he said politely. ""I am easy to suit, andI foresee that Frank and I will become intimate friends.""""He was very urgent to have you come. I am not quite sure whether itwould have been safe for me to refuse.""""I hope he will be as urgent to have me stay. That will be a stillhigher compliment.""""Here is the room you are to occupy, Mr. Morton,"" said Mrs. Frost,opening a door at the head of the front stairs.It was a large square room, occupying the front eastern corner of thehouse. The furniture was neat and comfortable, though not pretentious.""I like this,"" said the young man, surveying his new quarters with anair of satisfaction. ""The sun will find me out in the morning.""""Yes, it will remain with you through the forenoon. I think you willfind the room warm and comfortable. But whenever you get tired of it youwill be welcome downstairs.""""That is an invitation of which I shall be only too glad to availmyself. Now, Frank, if you will be kind enough to help me upstairs withmy trunk.""The trunk was carried up between them, and placed in a closet.""I will send for a variety of articles from the city to make my roomlook social and cheerful,"" said Mr. Morton. ""I have some books andengravings in Boston, which I think will contribute to make it so.""A day or two later, two large boxes arrived, one containing pictures,the other books. Of the latter there were perhaps a hundred and fifty,choice and well selected.Frank looked at them with avidity.""You shall be welcome to use them as freely as you like,"" said theowner--an offer which Frank gratefully accepted.The engravings were tastefully framed in black walnut. One representedone of Raphael\'s Madonnas. Another was a fine photograph, representinga palace in Venice. Several others portrayed foreign scenes. Among themwas a street scene in Rome. An entire family were sitting in differentpostures on the portico of a fine building, the man with his swarthyfeatures half-concealed under a slouch hat, the woman holding a childin her lap, while another, a boy with large black eyes, leaned his headupon her knees.""That represents a Roman family at home,"" explained Henry Morton.""At home!""""Yes, it is the only home they have. They sleep wherever night findsthem, sheltering themselves from the weather as well as they can.""""But how do they get through the winter? should think they wouldfreeze.""""Nature has bestowed upon Italy a mild climate, so that, although theymay find the exposure at this season disagreeable, they are in no dangerof freezing.""There was another engraving which Frank looked at curiously. Itrepresented a wagon laden with casks of wine, and drawn by an ox anda donkey yoked together. Underneath was a descriptive phrase, ""Caro divino.""""You don\'t see such teams in this country,"" said Mr. Morton, smiling.""In Italy they are common enough. In the background you notice a priestwith a shovel-hat, sitting sideways on a donkey. Such a sight is muchmore common there than that of a man on horseback. Indeed, this stubbornanimal is found very useful in ascending and descending mountains, beingmuch surer-footed than the horse. I have ridden down steep descentsalong the verge of a precipice where it would have been madness toventure on horseback, but I felt the strongest confidence in the donkeyI bestrode.""Frank noticed a few Latin books in the collection. ""Do you read Latin,Mr. Morton?"" he inquired.""Yes, with tolerable ease. If I can be of any assistance to you incarrying on your Latin studies, it will afford me pleasure to do so.""""I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Morton. I tried to go on with it bymyself, but every now and then I came to a difficult sentence which Icould not make out.""""I think we can overcome the difficulties between us. At any rate, wewill try. Have no hesitation in applying to me.""Before closing this chapter, I think it necessary to narrate a littleincident which served to heighten the interest with which Frank regardedhis new friend, though it involved the latter in a shadow of mystery.Mrs. Frost did not keep what in New England is denominated ""help."" Beingin good health, she performed the greater part of her household tasksunassisted. When washing and house-cleaning days came, however, sheobtained outside assistance. For this purpose she engaged Chloe to cometwice a week, on Monday and Saturday, not only because in this way shecould help the woman to earn a living, but also because she found her avaluable and efficient assistant.Henry Morton became a member of the little household at the farm onThursday, and two days later Chloe came as usual to ""clean house.""The young man was standing in the front yard as Chloe, with a whiteturban on her head, for she had not yet laid aside her Southern mode ofdress, came from the street by a little path which led to the back door.Her attention was naturally drawn to the young man. No sooner did sheobtain a full view of him, than she stopped short and exclaimed withevery appearance of surprise, ""Why, Mass\' Richard, who\'d\'a\' thought tosee you here. You look just like you used to do, dat\'s a fac\'. It doesmy old eyes good to see you.""Henry Morton turned suddenly.""What, Chloe!"" he exclaimed in equal surprise. ""What brings you up here?I thought you were miles away, in Virginia.""""So I was, Mass\' Richard. But Lor\' bless you, when de Linkum sogerscome, I couldn\'t stay no longer. I took and runned away.""""And here you are, then.""""Yes, Mass\' Richard, here I is, for sure.""""How do you like the North, Chloe?""""Don\'t like it as well as de Souf. It\'s too cold,"" and Chloe shivered.""But you would rather be here than there?""""Yes, Mass\' Richard. Here I own myself. Don\'t have no oberseer to crackhis whip at me now. I\'se a free woman now, and so\'s my little Pomp.""The young man smiled at the innocent mistake.""Pomp is your little boy, I suppose, Chloe.""""Yes, Mass\' Richard.""""Is he a good boy?""""He\'s as sassy as de debble,"" said Chloe emphatically. ""I don\'t knowwhat\'s goin\' to \'come of dat boy. He\'s most worried my life out.""""Oh, he\'ll grow better as he grows older. Don\'t trouble yourself abouthim. But, Chloe, there\'s one favor I am going to ask of you.""""Yes, Mass\' Richard.""""Don\'t call me by my real name. For some reasons, which I can\'t atpresent explain, I prefer to be known as Henry Morton, for some monthsto come. Do you think you can remember to call me by that name?""""Yes, Mass\'--Henry,"" said Chloe, looking perplexed.Henry Morton turned round to meet the surprised looks of Frank and hismother.""My friends,"" he said, ""I hope you will not feel distrustful of me, whenI freely acknowledge to you that imperative reasons compel me for a timeto appear under a name not my own. Chloe and I are old acquaintances,but I must request her to keep secret for a time her past knowledgeconcerning me. I think,"" he added with a smile, ""that she would havenothing to say that would damage me. Some time you shall know all. Areyou satisfied?""""Quite so,"" said Mrs. Frost. ""I have no doubt you have good andsufficient reason.""""I will endeavor to justify your confidence,"" said Henry Morton, anexpression of pleasure lighting up his face.']"
86,19,Chapter 19,"['XVIII. THANKSGIVING AT THE FARMThe chill November days drew to a close. The shrill winds whistledthrough the branches of the trees, and stirred the leaves which layin brown heaps upon the ground. But at the end of the month cameThanksgiving--the farmer\'s Harvest Home. The fruits of the field were inabundance but in many a home there were vacant chairs, never more, alas!to be filled. But he who dies in a noble cause leaves sweet and fragrantmemories behind, which shall ever after make it pleasant to think ofhim.Thanksgiving morning dawned foggy and cold. Yet there is something inthe name that warms the heart and makes the dullest day seem bright. Thesunshine of the heart more than compensates for the absence of sunshinewithout.Frank had not been idle.The night before he helped Jacob kill a turkey and a pair of chickens,and seated on a box in the barn they had picked them clean inpreparation for the morrow.Within the house, too, might be heard the notes of busy preparation.Alice, sitting in a low chair, was busily engaged in chopping meatfor mince pies. Maggie sat near her paring pumpkins, for a genuine NewEngland Thanksgiving cannot be properly celebrated without pumpkin pies.Even little Charlie found work to do in slicing apples.By evening a long row of pies might be seen upon the kitchen dresser.Brown and flaky they looked, fit for the table of a prince. So thechildren thought as they surveyed the attractive array, and felt thatThanksgiving, come as often as it might, could never be unwelcome.Through the forenoon of Thanksgiving day the preparations continued.Frank and Mr. Morton went to the village church, where an appropriateservice was held by Reverend Mr. Apthorp. There were but few ofthe village matrons present. They were mostly detained at home byhousewifely cares, which on that day could not well be delegated toother hands.""Mr. Morton,"" said Frank, as they walked leisurely home, ""did you noticehow Squire Haynes stared at you this morning?""Mr. Morton looked interested. ""Did he?"" he asked. ""I did not notice.""""Yes, he turned halfround, and looked at you with a puzzled expression,as if he thought he had seen you somewhere before, but could not recallwho you were.""""Perhaps I reminded him of some one he has known in past years,"" saidthe young man quietly. ""We sometimes find strange resemblances in utterstrangers.""""I think he must have felt quite interested,"" pursued Frank, ""for hestopped me after church, and inquired who you were.""""Indeed!"" said Henry Morton quietly. ""And what did you tell him?""""I told him your name, and mentioned that you were boarding with us.""""What then? Did he make any further inquiries?""""He asked where you came from.""""He seemed quite curious about me. I ought to feel flattered. And whatdid you reply?""""I told him I did not know--that I only knew that part of your lifehad been passed in Europe. I heard him say under his breath, \'It issingular.\'""""Frank,"" said Mr. Morton, after a moment\'s thought, ""I wish to haveSquire Haynes learn as little of me as possible. If, therefore, heshould ask you how I am employed, you say that I have come here forthe benefit of my health. This is one of my motives, though not theprincipal one.""""I will remember,"" said Frank. ""I don\'t think he will say much to me,however. He has a grudge against father, and his son does not like me.I am sorry that father is compelled to have some business relations withthe squire.""""Indeed!""""Yes, he holds a mortgage on our farm for eight hundred dollars. It wasoriginally more, but it has been reduced to this. He will have the rightto foreclose on the first of July.""""Shall you have the money ready for him at that time?""""No; we may have half enough, perhaps. I am sometimes troubled when Ithink of it. Father feels confident, however, that the squire will notbe hard upon us, but will renew the mortgage.""Henry Morton looked very thoughtful, but said nothing.They had now reached the farmhouse.Dinner was already on the table. In the center, on a large dish, wasthe turkey, done to a turn. It was flanked by the chickens on a smallerdish. These were supported by various vegetables, such as the seasonsupplied. A dish of cranberry sauce stood at one end of the table, andat the opposite end a dish of apple sauce.""Do you think you can carve the turkey, Mr. Morton?"" asked Mrs. Frost.""I will at least make the attempt.""""I want the wish-bone, Mr. Morton,"" said Maggie.""No, I want it,"" said Charlie.""You shall both have one,"" said the mother. ""Luckily each of thechickens is provided with one.""""I know what I am going to wish,"" said Charlie, nodding his head withdecision.""Well, Charlie, what is it?"" asked Frank.""I shall wish that papa may come home safe.""""And so will I,"" said Maggie.""I wish he might sit down with us to-day,"" said Mrs. Frost, with alittle sigh. ""He has never before been absent from us on Thanksgivingday.""""Was he well when you last heard from him?""""Yes, but hourly expecting orders to march to join the army in Maryland.I am afraid he won\'t get as good a Thanksgiving dinner as this.""""Two years ago,"" said Mr. Morton, ""I ate my Thanksgiving dinner inAmsterdam.""""Do they have Thanksgiving there, Mr. Morton?"" inquired Alice.""No, they know nothing of our good New England festival. I was obligedto order a special dinner for myself. I don\'t think you would haverecognized plum pudding under the name which they gave it.""""What was it?"" asked Frank curiously.""Blom buden was the name given on the bill.""""I can spell better than that,"" said Charlie.""We shall have to send you out among the Dutchmen as a schoolmasterplenipotentiary,"" said Frank, laughing. ""I hope the \'blom buden\' wasgood in spite of the way it was spelt.""""Yes, it was very good.""""I don\'t believe it beat mother\'s,"" said Charlie.""At your present rate of progress, Charlie, you won\'t leave room forany,"" said Frank.""I wish I had two stomachs,"" said Charlie, looking regretfully at theinviting delicacies which tempted him with what the French call theembarrassment of riches.""Well done, Charlie!"" laughed his mother.Dinner was at length over. Havoc and desolation reigned upon the oncewell-filled table.In the evening, as they all sat together round the table, Maggie climbedon Mr. Morton\'s knee and petitioned for a story.""What shall it be about?"" he asked.""Oh, anything.""""Let me think a moment,"" said the young man.He bent his eyes thoughtfully upon the wood-fire that crackled in thewide-open fireplace, and soon signified that he was ready to begin.All the children gathered around him, and even Mrs. Frost, sittingquietly at her knitting, edged her chair a little nearer, that she, too,might listen to Mr. Morton\'s story. As this was of some length, we shalldevote to it a separate chapter.']"
86,20,Chapter 20,"['XIX. THE WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION""My story,"" commenced Mr. Morton, ""is rather a remarkable one in somerespects; and I cannot vouch for its being true. I shall call it \'TheWonderful Transformation.\'""Thomas Tubbs was a prosperous little tailor, and for forty years hadbeen a resident of the town of Webbington, where he had been born andbrought up. I have called him little, and you will agree with me when Isay that, even in high-heeled boots, which he always wore, he measuredonly four feet and a half in height.""In spite, however, of his undersize, Thomas had succeeded in winningthe hand of a woman fifteen inches taller than himself. If this extraheight had been divided equally between them, possibly they might haveattracted less observation. As it was, when they walked to church, thetop of the little tailor\'s beaver just about reached the shoulders ofMrs. Tubbs. Nevertheless, they managed to live very happily together,for the most part, though now and then, when Thomas was a littlerefractory, his better half would snatch him up bodily, and, carryinghim to the cellar, lock him up there. Such little incidents only servedto spice their domestic life, and were usually followed by a warmreconciliation.""The happy pair had six children, all of whom took after their mother,and promised to be tall; the oldest boy, twelve years of age, beingalready taller than his father, or, rather, he would have been but forthe tall hat and high-heeled boots.""Mr. Tubbs was a tailor, as I have said. One day there came into hisshop a man attired with extreme shabbiness. Thomas eyed him askance.""\'Mr. Tubbs,\' said the stranger, \'as you perceive, I am out at theelbows. I would like to get you to make me up a suit of clothes.\'""\'Ahem!\' coughed Thomas, and glanced upward at a notice affixed to thedoor, \'Terms, Cash.\'""The stranger\'s eye followed the direction of Mr. Tubbs\'. He smiled.""\'I frankly confess,\' he said, \'that I shall not be able to payimmediately, but, if I live, I will pay you within six months.\'""\'How am I to feel sure of that?\' asked the tailor, hesitating.""\'I pledge my word,\' was the reply. \'You see, Mr. Tubbs, I have beensick for some time past, and that, of course, has used up my money. Now,thank Providence, I am well again, and ready to go to work. But I needclothes, as you see, before I have the ability to pay for them.\'""\'What\'s your name?\' asked Thomas.""\'Oswald Rudenheimer,\' was the reply.""\'A foreigner?\'""\'As you may suppose. Now, Mr. Tubbs, what do you say? Do you think youcan trust me?\'""Thomas examined the face of his visitor. He looked honest, and thelittle tailor had a good deal of confidence in the excellence of humannature.""\'I may be foolish,\' he said at last, \'but I\'ll do it.\'""\'A thousand thanks!\' said the stranger. \'You sha\'n\'t repent of it.\'""The cloth was selected, and Thomas set to work. In three days the suitwas finished, and Thomas sat in his shop waiting for his customer. Atlast he came, but what a change! He was splendidly dressed. The littletailor hardly recognized him.""\'Mr. Tubbs,\' said he, \'you\'re an honest man and a good fellow. Youtrusted me when I appeared penniless, but I deceived you. I am reallyone of the genii, of whom, perhaps, you have read, and lineallydescended from those who guarded Solomon\'s seal. Instead of making youwait for your pay, I will recompense you on the spot, either in moneyor----\'""\'Or what? asked the astonished tailor.""\'Or I will grant the first wish that may be formed in your mind. Nowchoose.\'""Thomas did not take long to choose. His charge would amount to buta few dollars, while he might wish for a million. He signified hisdecision.""\'Perhaps you have chosen wisely,\' said his visitor. \'But mind that youare careful about your wish. You may wish for something you don\'t want.\'""\'No fear of that,\' said the tailor cheerfully.""\'At any rate, I will come this way six months hence, and should youthen wish to be released from the consequences of your wish, and toreceive instead the money stipulated as the price of the suit, I willgive you the chance.\'""Of course, Thomas did not object, though he considered it rather afoolish proposition.""His visitor disappeared, and the tailor was left alone. He laid asidehis work. How could a man be expected to work who had only to wish, andhe could come into possession of more than he could earn in a hundred oreven a thousand years?""\'I might as well enjoy myself a little,\' thought Mr. Tubbs. \'Let mesee. I think there is a show in the village to-day. I\'ll go to it.\'""He accordingly slipped on his hat and went out, somewhat to thesurprise of his wife, who concluded that her husband must be going outon business.""Thomas Tubbs wended his way to the marketplace. He pressed in amongthe people, a crowd of whom had already assembled to witness the show.I cannot tell you what the show was. I am only concerned in telling youwhat Thomas Tubbs saw and did; and, to tell the plain truth, he didn\'tsee anything at all. He was wedged in among people a foot or two tallerthan himself. Now, it is not pleasant to hear all about you laughingheartily and not even catch a glimpse of what amuses them so much.Thomas Tubbs was human, and as curious as most people. Just as asix-footer squeezed in front of him he could not help framing, in hisvexation, this wish:""\'Oh, dear! I wish I were ten feet high!\'""Luckless Thomas Tubbs! Never had he framed a more unfortunate wish. Onthe instant he shot up from an altitude of four feet six to ten feet.Fortunately his clothes expanded proportionally. So, instead of beingbelow the medium height, he was raised more than four feet above it.""Of course, his immediate neighbors became aware of the giganticpresence, though they did not at all recognize its identity with thelittle tailor, Thomas Tubbs.""At once there was a shout of terror. The crowd scattered in alldirections, forgetting the spectacle at which, the moment before, theyhad been laughing heartily, and the little tailor, no longer little, wasleft alone in the market-place.""\'Good heavens!\' he exclaimed in bewilderment, stretching out hisbrawny arm, nearly five feet in length, and staring at it in ludicrousastonishment, \'who\'d have thought that I should ever be so tall?\'""To tell the truth, the little man--I mean Mr. Tubbs--at first ratherenjoyed his new magnitude. He had experienced mortification so long onaccount of his diminutive stature, that he felt a little exhilaratedat the idea of being able to look down on those to whom he had hithertofelt compelled to look up. It was rather awkward to have people afraidof him. As he turned to leave the square, for the exhibitor of the showhad run off in the general panic, he could see people looking at himfrom third-story windows, and pointing at him with outstretched fingersand mouths agape.""\'Really,\' thought Thomas Tubbs, \'I never expected to be such an objectof interest. I think I\'ll go home.\'""His house was a mile off, but so large were his strides that fiveminutes carried him to it.""Now Mrs. Tubbs was busy putting the dinner on the table, and wonderingwhy her husband did not make his appearance. She was fully determinedto give him a scolding in case his delay was so great as to cause thedinner to cool. All at once she heard a bustle at the door. Looking intothe entry, she saw a huge man endeavoring to make his entrance intothe house. As the portal was only seven feet in height, it was notaccomplished without a great deal of twisting and squirming.""Mrs. Tubbs turned pale.""\'What are you trying to do, you monster?\' she faltered.""\'I have come home to dinner, Mary,\' was the meek reply.""\'Come home to dinner!\' exclaimed Mrs. Tubbs, aghast. \'Who in the nameof wonder are you, you overgrown brute?\'""\'Who am I? asked the giant, smiling feebly, for he began to feel alittle queer at this reception from the wife with whom he had lived forfifteen years. \'Ha! ha! don\'t you know your own husband--your Tommy?\'""\'My husband!\' exclaimed Mrs. Tubbs, astonished at the fellow\'simpudence. \'You, don\'t mean to say that you are my husband?\'""\'Of course I am,\' said Thomas.""\'Then,\' said Mrs. Tubbs, \'I would have you know that my husband is arespectable little man, not half your size.\'""\'Oh, dear!\' thought Thomas. \'Well, here\'s a kettle of fish; my ownwife won\'t own me!\'""\'So I was,\' he said aloud. \'I was only four feet six; but I\'ve--I\'vegrown.\'""\'Grown!\' Mrs. Tubbs laughed hysterically. \'That\'s a likely story,when it\'s only an hour since my husband went into the street as short asever. I only wish he\'d come in, I do, to expose your imposition.\'""\'But I have grown, Mary,\' said Tubbs piteously. \'I was out in thecrowd, and I couldn\'t see what was going on, and so I wished I was tenfeet high; and, before I knew it, I was as tall as I am now.\'""\'No doubt,\' said Mrs. Tubbs incredulously, \'As to that, all I\'ve gotto say is, that you\'d better wish yourself back again, as I sha\'n\'t ownyou as my husband till you do!\'""\'Really,\' thought Mr. Tubbs, \'this is dreadful! What can I do!\'""Just then one of his children ran into the room.""\'Johnny, come to me,\' said his father imploringly. \'Come to yourfather.\'""\'My father!\' said Johnny, shying out of the room. \'You ain\'t myfather. My father isn\'t as tall as a tree.\'""\'You see how absurd your claim is,\' said Mrs. Tubbs. \'You\'ll oblige meby leaving the house directly.\'""\'Leave the house--my house!\' said Tubbs.""\'If you don\'t, I\'ll call in the neighbors,\' said the courageous woman.""\'I don\'t believe they\'d dare to come,\' said Tubbs, smiling queerly atthe recollection of what a sensation his appearance had made.""\'Won\'t you go?\'""\'At least you\'ll let me have some dinner. I am \'most famished.\'""\'Dinner!"" said Mrs. Tubbs, hesitating. \'I don\'t think there\'s enoughin the house. However, you can sit down to the table.\'""Tubbs attempted to sit down on a chair, but his weight was so greatthat it was crushed beneath him. Finally, he was compelled to sit onthe floor, and even then his stature was such that his head rose to theheight of six feet.""What an enormous appetite he had, too! The viands on the table seemednothing. He at first supplied his plate with the usual quantity; but asthe extent of his appetite became revealed to him, he was forced to makeaway with everything on the table. Even then he was hungry.""\'Well, I declare,\' thought Mrs. Tubbs, in amazement, \'it does take animmense quantity to keep him alive!\'""Tubbs rose from the table, and, in doing so, hit his head a smart whackagainst the ceiling. Before leaving the house he turned to make a lastappeal to his wife, who, he could not help seeing, was anxious to havehim go.""\'Won\'t you own me, Mary?\' he asked. \'It isn\'t my fault that I am sobig.\'""\'Own you!\' exclaimed his wife. \'I wouldn\'t own you for a mint ofmoney. You\'d eat me out of house and home in less than a week.\'""\'I don\'t know but I should,\' said Mr. Tubbs mournfully. \'I don\'t seewhat gives me such an appetite. I\'m hungry now.\'""\'Hungry, after you\'ve eaten enough for six!\' exclaimed his wife,aghast. \'Well, I never!\'""\'Then you won\'t let me stay, Mary?\'""\'No, no.\'""With slow and sad strides Thomas Tubbs left the house. The world seemeddark enough to the poor fellow. Not only was he disowned by his wife andchildren, but he could not tell how he should ever earn enough to keephim alive, with the frightful appetite which he now possessed. \'I don\'tknow,\' he thought, \'but the best way is to drown myself at once.\' So hewalked to the river, but found it was not deep enough to drown him.""As he emerged from the river uncomfortably wet, he saw a man timidlyapproaching him. It proved to be the manager of the show.""\'Hello!\' said he hesitatingly.""\'Hello!\' returned Tubbs disconsolately.""\'Would you like to enter into a business engagement with me?\'""\'Of what sort?\' asked Tubbs, brightening up.""\'To be exhibited,\' was the reply. \'You\'re the largest man living inthe world. We could make a pretty penny together.\'""Tubbs was glad enough to accept this proposition, which came to himlike a plank to a drowning man. Accordingly an agreement was made that,after deducting expenses, he should share profits with the manager.""It proved to be a great success. From all quarters people flocked tosee the great prodigy, the wonder of the world, as he was described inhuge posters. Scientific men wrote learned papers in which they stroveto explain his extraordinary height, and, as might be expected, no twoassigned the same cause.""At the end of six months Tubbs had five thousand dollars as his shareof the profits. But after all he was far from happy. He missedthe society of his wife and children, and shed many tears over hisseparation from them.""At the end of six months his singular customer again made hisappearance.""\'It seems to me you\'ve altered some since I last saw you,\' he said,with a smile.""\'Yes,\' said Tubbs dolefully.""\'You don\'t like the change, I judge?\'""\'No,\' said Tubbs. \'It separates me from my wife and children, and thatmakes me unhappy.\'""\'Would you like to be changed back again!\'""\'Gladly,\' was the reply.""Presto! the wonderful giant was changed back into the little tailor. Nosooner was this effected than he returned post-haste to Webbington. Hiswife received him with open arms.""\'Oh, Thomas,\' she exclaimed, \'how could you leave us so? On the day ofyour disappearance a huge brute of a man came here and pretended to beyou, but I soon sent him away.\'""Thomas wisely said nothing, but displayed his five thousand dollars.There was great joy in the little dwelling. Thomas Tubbs at once took alarger shop, and grew every year in wealth and public esteem. Theonly way in which he did not grow was in stature; but his six months\'experience as a giant had cured him of any wish of that sort. The last Iheard of him was his election to the legislature.""""That\'s a bully story,"" said Charlie, using a word which he had heardfrom older boys. ""I wish I was a great tall giant.""""What would you do if you were, Charlie?""""I\'d go and fight the rebels,"" said Charlie manfully.']"
86,21,Chapter 21,"['XX. POMP\'S EDUCATION COMMENCESIn the season of leisure from farm work which followed, Frank foundconsiderable time for study. The kind sympathy and ready assistancegiven by Mr. Morton made his task a very agreeable one, and his progressfor a time was as rapid as if he had remained at school.He also assumed the office of teacher, having undertaken to give alittle elementary instruction to Pomp. Here his task was beset withdifficulties. Pomp was naturally bright, but incorrigibly idle.His activity was all misdirected and led him into a wide variety ofmischief. He had been sent to school, but his mischievous propensitieshad so infected the boys sitting near him that the teacher had beencompelled to request his removal.Three times in the week, during the afternoon, Pomp came over to thefarm for instruction. On the first of these occasions we will look inupon him and his teacher.Pomp is sitting on a cricket by the kitchen fire. He has a primer openbefore him at the alphabet. His round eyes are fixed upon the page aslong as Frank is looking at him, but he requires constant watching. Histeacher sits near-by, with a Latin dictionary resting upon a light standbefore him, and a copy of Virgil\'s Aeneid in his hand.""Well, Pomp, do you think you know your lesson?"" he asks.""Dunno, Mass\' Frank; I reckon so.""""You may bring your book to me, and I will try you.""Pomp rose from his stool and sidled up to Frank with no great alacrity.""What\'s that letter, Pomp?"" asked the young teacher, pointing out theinitial letter of the alphabet.Pomp answered correctly.""And what is the next?""Pomp shifted from one foot to the other, and stared vacantly out of thewindow, but said nothing.""Don\'t you know?""""\'Pears like I don\'t \'member him, Mass\' Frank.""Here Frank had recourse to a system of mnemonics frequently resorted toby teachers in their extremity.""What\'s the name of the little insect that stings people sometimes,Pomp?""""Wasp, Mass\' Frank,"" was the confident reply.""No, I don\'t mean that. I mean the bee.""""Yes, Mass\' Frank.""""Well, this is B.""Pomp looked at it attentively, and, after a pause, inquired, ""Where\'shim wings, Mass\' Frank?""Frank bit his lips to keep from laughing. ""I don\'t mean that this is abee that makes honey,"" he explained, ""only it has the same name. Now doyou think you can remember how it is called?"" ""Bumblebee!"" repeated Pomptriumphantly.Pomp\'s error was corrected, and the lesson proceeded.""What is the next letter?"" asked Frank, indicating it with the point ofhis knife-blade.""X,"" answered the pupil readily.""No, Pomp,"" was the dismayed reply. ""It is very different from X.""""Dat\'s him name at school,"" said Pomp positively.""No, Pomp, you are mistaken. That is X, away down there.""""Perhaps him change his name,"" suggested Pomp.""No. The letters never change their names. I don\'t think you know yourlesson, Pomp. just listen to me while I tell you the names of some ofthe letters, and try to remember them.""When this was done, Pomp was directed to sit down on the cricket, andstudy his lesson for twenty Minutes, at the end of which he might againrecite.Pomp sat down, and for five minutes seemed absorbed in his book. Then,unfortunately, the cat walked into the room, and soon attracted theattention of the young student. He sidled from his seat so silently thatFrank did not hear him. He was soon made sensible that Pomp was engagedin some mischief by hearing a prolonged wail of anguish from the cat.Looking up, he found that his promising pupil had tied her by the leg toa chair, and under these circumstances was amusing himself by pinchingher tail.""What are you doing there, Pomp?"" he asked quickly.Pomp scuttled back to his seat, and appeared to be deeply intent uponhis primer.""Ain\'t doin\' noffin\', Mass\' Frank,"" he answered innocently.""Then how came the cat tied to that chair?""""\'Spec\' she must have tied herself.""""Come, Pomp, you know better than that. You know cats can\'t tiethemselves. Get up immediately and unfasten her.""Pomp rose with alacrity, and undertook to release puss from the thraldomof which she had become very impatient. Perhaps she would have beenquite as well off if she had been left to herself. The process ofliberation did not appear to be very agreeable, judging from the angrymews which proceeded from her. Finally, in her indignation against Pompfor some aggressive act, she scratched him sharply.""You wicked old debble!"" exclaimed Pomp wrathfully.He kicked at the cat; but she was lucky enough to escape, and ran out ofthe room as fast as her four legs could carry her.""Big ugly debble!"" muttered Pomp, watching the blood ooze from hisfinger.""What\'s the matter, Pomp?""""Old cat scratch me.""""And what did you do to her, Pomp? I am afraid you deserved yourscratch.""""Didn\'t do noffin\', Mass\' Frank,"" said Pomp virtuously.""I don\'t think you always tell the truth, Pomp.""""Can\'t help it, Mass\' Frank. \'Spec\' I\'ve got a little debble inside ofme.""""What do you mean, Pomp! What put that idea in your head?""""Dat\'s what mammy says. Dat\'s what she al\'ays tells me.""""Then,"" said Frank, ""I think it will be best to whip it out of you.Where\'s my stick?""""Oh, no, Mass\' Frank,"" said Pomp, in alarm; ""I\'ll be good, for sure.""""Then sit down and get your lesson.""Again Pomp assumed his cricket. Before he had time to devise any newmischief, Mrs. Frost came to the head of the stairs and called Frank.Frank laid aside his books, and presented himself at the foot of thestairs.""I should like your help a few minutes. Can you leave your studies?""""Certainly, mother.""Before going up, he cautioned Pomp to study quietly, and not get intoany mischief while he was gone. Pomp promised very readily.Frank had hardly got upstairs before his pupil rose from the cricket,and began to look attentively about him. His first proceeding was to,hide his primer carefully in Mrs. Frost\'s work-basket, which lay on thetable. Then, looking curiously about him, his attention was drawn to theold-fashioned clock that stood in the corner.Now, Pomp\'s curiosity had been strongly excited by this clock. It wasnot quite clear to him how the striking part was effected. Here seemedto be a favorable opportunity for instituting an investigation. Pompdrew his cricket to, the clock, and, opening it, tried to reach up tothe face. But he was not yet high enough. He tried a chair, and stillrequired a greater elevation. Espying Frank\'s Latin dictionary, hepressed that into service.By and by Frank and his mother heard the clock striking an unusualnumber of times.""What is the matter with the clock?"" inquired Mrs. Frost.""I don\'t know,"" said Frank unsuspiciously.""It has struck ten times, and it is only four o\' clock.""""I wonder if Pomp can have got at it,"" said Frank, with a suddenthought.He ran downstairs hastily.Pomp heard him coming, and in his anxiety to escape detection, contrivedto lose his balance and fall to the floor. As he fell, he struckthe table, on which a pan of sour milk had been placed, and it wasoverturned, deluging poor Pomp with the unsavory fluid.Pomp shrieked and kicked most energetically. His appearance, as hepicked himself up, was ludicrous in the extreme. His sable face wasplentifully besprinkled with clotted milk, giving him the appearanceof a negro who is coming out white in spots. The floor was swimming inmilk. Luckily the dictionary had fallen clear of it, and so escaped.""Is this the way you study?"" demanded Frank, as sternly as his sense ofthe ludicrous plight in which he found Pomp would permit.For once Pomp\'s ready wit deserted him. He had nothing to say.""Go out and wash yourself.""Pomp came back rather shamefaced, his face restored to its originalcolor.""Now, where is your book?""Pomp looked about him, but, as he took good care not to look where heknew his book to be, of course he did not find it.""I \'clare, Mass\' Frank, it done lost,"" he at length asserted.""How can it be lost when you had it only a few minutes ago?""""I dunno,"" answered Pomp stolidly.""Have you been out of the room?""Pomp answered in the negative.""Then it must be somewhere here.""Frank went quietly to the corner of the room and took therefrom a stick.""Now, Pomp,"" he said, ""I will give you just two minutes to find the bookin. If you don\'t find it, I shall have to give you a whipping.""Pomp looked at his teacher to see if he was in earnest. Seeing that hewas, he judged it best to find the book.Looking into the work-box, he said innocently: ""I \'clare to gracious,Mass\' Frank, if it hasn\'t slipped down yere. Dat\'s mi\'ty cur\'s, dat is.""""Pomp, sit down,"" said Frank. ""I am going to talk to you seriously. Whatmakes you tell so many lies?""""Dunno any better,"" replied Pomp, grinning.""Yes, you do, Pomp. Doesn\'t your mother tell you not to lie?""""Lor\', Mass\' Frank, she\'s poor ignorant nigger. She don\'t know nuffin\'.""""You mustn\'t speak so of your mother. She brings you up as well as sheknows how. She has to work hard for you, and you ought to love her.""""So I do, \'cept when she licks me.""""If you behave properly she won\'t whip you. You\'ll grow up a \'poor,ignorant nigger\' yourself, if you don\'t study.""""Shall I get white, Mass\' Frank, if I study?"" asked Pomp, showing adouble row of white teeth.""You were white enough just now,"" said Frank, smiling.""Yah, yah!"" returned Pomp, who appreciated the joke.""Now, Pomp,"" Frank continued seriously, ""if you will learn your lessonin fifteen minutes I will give you a piece of gingerbread.""""I\'ll do it, Mass\' Frank,"" said Pomp promptly.Pomp was very fond of gingerbread, as Frank very well knew. In the timespecified the lesson was got, and recited satisfactorily.As Pomp\'s education will not again be referred to, it may be said thatwhen Frank had discovered how to manage him, he learned quite rapidly.Chloe, who was herself unable to read, began to look upon Pomp witha new feeling of respect when she found that he could read stories inwords of one syllable, and the ""lickings"" of which he complained becameless frequent. But his love of fun still remained, and occasionally gothim into trouble, as we shall hereafter have occasion to see.']"
86,22,Chapter 22,"['XXI. THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURGAbout the middle of December came the sad tragedy of Fredericksburg,in which thousands of our gallant soldiers yielded up their lives in ahard, unequal struggle, which brought forth nothing but mortificationand disaster.The first telegrams which appeared in the daily papers brought anxietyand bodings of ill to many households. The dwellers at the farm werenot exempt. They had been apprised by a recent letter that Mr. Frost\'sregiment now formed a part of the grand army which lay encamped onthe eastern side of the Rappahannock. The probability was that he wasengaged in the battle. Frank realized for the first time to what perilhis father was exposed, and mingled with the natural feeling which sucha thought was likely to produce was the reflection that, but for him,his father would have been in safety at home.""Did I do right?"" Frank asked himself anxiously, the old doubt recurringonce more.Then, above the selfish thought of peril to him and his, rose theconsideration of the country\'s need, and Frank said to himself, ""I havedone right--whatever happens. I feel sure of that.""Yet his anxiety was by no means diminished, especially when, a day ortwo afterward, tidings of the disaster came to hand, only redeemed bythe masterly retreat across the river, in which a great army, withoutthe loss of a single gun, ambulance, or wagon, withdrew from the sceneof a hopeless struggle, under the very eyes of the enemy, yet escapingdiscovery.One afternoon Frank went to the post-office a little after the usualtime. As he made his way through a group at the door, he noticecompassionate glances directed toward him.His heart gave a sudden bound.""Has anything happened to my father?"" he inquired, with pale face. ""Haveany of you heard anything?""""He is wounded, Frank,"" said the nearest bystander.""Show it to me,"" said Frank.In the evening paper, which was placed in his hands, he read a singleline, but of fearful import: ""Henry Frost, wounded."" Whether the woundwas slight or serious, no intimation was given.Frank heaved a sigh of comparative relief. His father was not dead, ashe at first feared. Yet he felt that the suspense would be a serioustrial. He did not know how to tell his mother. She met him at the gate.His serious face and lagging steps revealed the truth, exciting at firstapprehensions of something even more serious.For two days they remained without news. Then came a letter from theabsent father, which wonderfully lightened all their hearts. The factthat he was able to write a long letter with his own hand showed plainlythat his wound must be a trifling one. The letter ran thus:""DEAR MARY: I fear that the report of my wound will reach you beforethis letter comes to assure you that it is a mere scratch, and scarcelyworth a thought. I cannot for an instant think of it, when I considerhow many of our poor fellows have been mown down by instant death, orare now lying with ghastly wounds on pallets in the hospital. We havebeen through a fearful trial, and the worst thought is that our lossesare not compensated by a single advantage.""Before giving you an account of it from the point of view of a privatesoldier, let me set your mind at rest by saying that my injury is only aslight flesh-wound in the arm, which will necessitate my carrying it ina sling for a few days; that is all.""Early on the morning of Thursday, the 10th inst., the first act in thegreat drama commenced with laying the pontoon bridges over which our menwere to make their way into the rebel city. My own division was to crossdirectly opposite the city. All honor to the brave men who volunteeredto lay the bridges. It was a trying and perilous duty. On the otherside, in rifle-pits and houses at the brink of the river, were postedthe enemy\'s sharpshooters, and these at a given signal opened fire uponour poor fellows who were necessarily unprotected. The firing was sosevere and deadly, and impossible to escape from, that for the timewe were obliged to desist. Before anything could be effected it becameclear that the sharpshooters must be dislodged.""Then opened the second scene.""A deluge of shot and shell from our side of the river rained upon thecity, setting some buildings on fire, and severely damaging others. Itwas a most exciting spectacle to us who watched from the bluffs, knowingthat ere long we must make the perilous passage and confront the foe,the mysterious silence of whose batteries inspired alarm, as indicatinga consciousness of power.""The time of our trial came at length.""Toward the close of the afternoon General Howard\'s division, to which Ibelong, crossed the pontoon bridge whose building had cost us more thanone gallant soldier. The distance was short, for the Rappahannock atthis point is not more than a quarter of a mile wide. In a few minuteswe were marching through the streets of Fredericksburg. We gainedpossession of the lower streets, but not without some street fighting,in which our brigade lost about one hundred in killed and wounded.""For the first time I witnessed violent death. The man marching bymy side suddenly reeled, and, pressing his hand to his breast, fellforward. Only a moment before he had spoken to me, saying, \'I think weare going to have hot work.\' Now he was dead, shot through the heart. Iturned sick with horror, but there was no time to pause. We must marchon, not knowing that our turn might not come next. Each of us felt thathe bore his life in his hand.""But this was soon over, and orders came that we should bivouac for thenight. You will not wonder that I lay awake nearly the whole night. Anight attack was possible, and the confusion and darkness would havemade it fearful. As I lay awake I could not help thinking how anxiousyou would feel if you had known where I was.""So closed the first day.""The next dawned warm and pleasant. In the quiet of the morning itseemed hard to believe that we were on the eve of a bloody struggle.Discipline was not very strictly maintained. Some of our number left theranks and ransacked the houses, more from curiosity than the desire topillage.""I went down to the bank of the river, and took a look at the bridgewhich it had cost us so much trouble to throw across. It bore frequentmarks of the firing of the day previous.""At one place I came across an old negro, whose white head and wrinkledface indicated an advanced age. Clinging to him were two children, ofperhaps four and six years of age, who had been crying.""\'Don\'t cry, honey,\' I heard him say soothingly, wiping the tears fromthe cheeks of the youngest with a coarse cotton handkerchief.""\'I want mama,\' said the child piteously.""A sad expression came over the old black\'s face.""\'What is the matter?\' I asked, advancing toward him.""\'She is crying for her mother,\' he said.""\'Is she dead?\'""\'Yes, sir; she\'d been ailing for a long time, and the guns ofyesterday hastened her death.\'""\'Where did you live?\'""\'In that house yonder, sir.\'""\'Didn\'t you feel afraid when we fired on the town?\'""\'We were all in the cellar, sir. One shot struck the house, but didnot injure it much.\'""\'You use very good language,\' I could not help saying.""\'Yes, sir; I have had more advantages than most of--of my class.\'These last words he spoke rather bitterly. \'When I was a young man mymaster amused himself with teaching me; but he found I learned so fastthat he stopped short. But I carried it on by myself.\'""\'Didn\'t you find that difficult?\'""\'Yes, sir; but my will was strong. I managed to get books, now oneway, now another. I have read considerable, sir.\'""This he said with some pride.""\'Have you ever read Shakespeare?\'""\'In part, sir; but I never could get hold of ""Hamlet."" I have alwayswanted to read that play.\'""I drew him out, and was astonished at the extent of his information,and the intelligent judgment which he expressed.""\'I wonder that, with your acquirements, you should have been contentto remain in a state of slavery.\'""\'Content!\' he repeated bitterly. \'Do you think I have been content?No, sir. Twice I attempted to escape. Each time I was caught, draggedback, and cruelly whipped. Then I was sold to the father of these littleones. He treated me so well, and I was getting so old, that I gave upthe idea of running away.\'""\'And where is he now?\'""\'He became a colonel in the Confederate service, and was killed atAntietam. Yesterday my mistress died, as I have told you.\'""\'And are you left in sole charge of these little children?\'""\'Yes, sir.\'""\'Have they no relatives living?\'""\'Their uncle lives in Kentucky. I shall try to carry them there.\'""\'But you will find it hard work. You have only to cross the river, andin our lines you will be no longer a slave.\'""\'I know it, sir. Three of my children have got their freedom, thankGod, in that way. But I can\'t leave these children.\'""I looked down at them. They were beautiful children. The youngest wasa girl, with small features, dark hair, and black eyes. The boy, of six,was pale and composed, and uttered no murmur. Both clung confidently tothe old negro.""I could not help admiring the old man, who could resist the prospect offreedom, though he had coveted it all his life, in order to remain loyalto his trust. I felt desirous of drawing him out on the subject of thewar.""\'What do you think of this war?\' I asked.""He lifted up his hand, and in a tone of solemnity, said, \'I think it isthe cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, that\'s going to drawus out of our bondage into the Promised Land.\'""I was struck by his answer.""\'Do many of you--I mean of those who have not enjoyed your advantagesof education--think so?\'""\'Yes, sir; we think it is the Lord\'s doings, and it is marvelous inour eyes. It\'s a time of trial and of tribulation; but it isn\'t a-goingto last. The children of Israel were forty years in the wilderness, andso it may be with us. The day of deliverance will come.\'""At this moment the little girl began again to cry, and he addressedhimself to soothe her.""This was not the only group I encountered. Some women had come, downto the river with children half-bereft of their senses--some apparentlysupposing that we should rob or murder them. The rebel leaders andnewspapers have so persistently reiterated these assertions, that theyhave come to believe them.""The third day was unusually lovely, but our hearts were too anxious toadmit of our enjoying it. The rebels were entrenched on heights behindthe town. It was necessary that these should be taken, and aboutnoon the movement commenced. Our forces marched steadily across theintervening plain. The rebels reserved their fire till we were half-wayacross, and then from all sides burst forth the deadly fire. We werecompletely at their mercy. Twenty men in my own company fell dead orwounded, among them the captain and first lieutenant. Of what followed Ican give you little idea. I gave myself up for lost. A desperate impulseenabled me to march on to what seemed certain destruction. All at onceI felt a sensation of numbness in my left arm, and looking down, I sawthat the blood was trickling from it.""But I had little time to think of myself. Hearing a smothered groan, Ilooked round, and saw Frank Grover, pale and reeling.""\'I\'m shot in the leg,\' he said. \'Don\'t leave me here. Help me along,and I will try to keep up with you.\'""The poor lad leaned upon me, and we staggered forward. But not forlong. A stone wall stared us in the face. Here rebel sharpshooters hadbeen stationed, and they opened a galling fire upon us. We returned it,but what could we do? We were compelled to retire, and did so in goodorder, but unfortunately not until the sharpshooters had picked off someof our best men.""Among the victims was the poor lad whom I assisted. A second bulletstruck him in the heart. He uttered just one word, \'mother,\' and fell.Poor boy, and poor mother! He seemed to have a premonition of hisapproaching death, and requested me the day previous to take charge ofhis effects, and send them with his love and a lock of his hair tohis mother if anything should befall him. This request I shall at oncecomply with. I have succeeded in getting the poor fellow\'s body broughtto camp, where it will be decently buried, and have cut from his headtwo brown locks, one for his mother, and one for myself.""At last we got back with ranks fearfully diminished. Many old familiarfaces were gone--the faces of those now lying stiff and stark in death.More were groaning with anguish in the crowded hospital. My own woundwas too trifling to require much attention. I shall have to wear a slingfor a few days perhaps.""There is little more to tell. Until Tuesday evening we maintained ourposition in daily expectation of an attack. But none was made. This wasmore fortunate for us. I cannot understand what withheld the enemy froman assault.""On Tuesday suddenly came the order to re-cross the river. It was astormy and dreary night, and so, of course, favorable to our purpose.The maneuver was executed in silence, and with commendable expedition.The rebels appeared to have no suspicion of General Burnside\'sintentions. The measured beat of our double quick was drowned by thefury of the storm, and with minds relieved, though bodies drenched,we once more found ourselves with the river between us and our foes.Nothing was left behind.""Here we are again, but not all of us. Many a brave soldier has breathedhis last, and lies under the sod. \'God\'s ways are dark, but soon or latethey touch the shining hills of day.\' So sings our own Whittier, and soI believe, in spite of the sorrowful disaster which we have met with. Itis all for the best if we could but see it.""Our heavy losses of officers have rendered some new appointmentsnecessary. Our second lieutenant has been made captain. The orderlysergeant and second sergeant are now our lieutenants, and the line ofpromotion has even reached me. I am a corporal.""I have been drawn into writing a very long letter, and I must nowclose, with the promise of writing again very soon. After I haveconcluded, I must write to poor Frank Grover\'s mother. May God comforther, for she has lost a boy of whom any mother might feel proud.""With love to the children, I remain, as ever, your affectionatehusband. HENRY FROST.""""How terrible it must have been,"" said Mrs. Frost, with a shudder, asshe folded up the letter and laid it down. ""We ought indeed to feelthankful that your father\'s life was spared.""""If I were three years older, I might have been in the battle,"" thoughtFrank.']"
86,23,Chapter 23,"['XXII. FRANK BROACHES A NEW PLANFor some time Frank had been revolving in his mind the feasibility of ascheme which he hoped to be able to carry into execution. It was no lessthan this--to form a military company among the boys, which shouldbe organized and drilled in all respects like those composed of olderpersons. He did not feel like taking any steps in the matter till he hadconsulted with some one in whose judgment he had confidence.One evening he mentioned his plan to Mr. Morton.""It is a capital idea, Frank,"" said the young man, with warm approval.""If I can be of service to you in this matter, it will afford me muchpleasure.""""There is one difficulty,"" suggested Frank. ""None of us boys knowanything about military tactics, and we shall need instruction to beginwith; but where we are to find a teacher I am sure I can\'t tell.""""I don\'t think you will have to look far,"" said Mr. Morton, with asmile.""Are you acquainted with the manual?"" asked Frank eagerly.""I believe so. You see you have not yet got to the end of myaccomplishments. I shall be happy to act as your drill-master until someone among your number is competent to take my place. I can previouslygive you some private lessons, if you desire it.""""There\'s nothing I should like better, Mr. Morton,"" said Frank joyfully.""Have you got a musket in the house, then? We shall get along betterwith one.""""There\'s one in the attic.""""Very well; if you will get it, we can make a beginning now.""Frank went in search of the musket; but in his haste tumbled down theattic stairs, losing his grasp of the musket, which fell down with aclatter.Mrs. Frost, opening the door of her bedroom in alarm, saw Frank on hisback with the musket lying across his chest.""What\'s the matter?"" she asked, not a little startled.Frank got up rubbing himself and looking rather foolish.""Nothing, mother; only I was in a little too much of a hurry.""""What are you going to do with that musket, Frank?""""Mr. Morton is going to teach me the manual, that is all, mother.""""I suppose the first position is horizontal,"" said his mother, with asmile.""I don\'t like that position very well,"" returned Frank, with a laugh. ""Iprefer the perpendicular.""Under his friend\'s instructions, Frank progressed rapidly. At the end ofthe third lesson, Mr. Morton said, ""You are nearly as competent to giveinstructions now as I am. There are some things, however, that cannot belearned alone. You had better take measures to form your company.""Frank called upon Mr. Rathburn, the principal of the academy, and aftercommunicating his plan, which met with the teacher\'s full approval,arranged to have notice given of a meeting of the boys immediately afterthe afternoon session.On Thursday afternoon when the last class had recited, previous toringing the bell, which was a signal that school was over, Mr. Rathburngave this brief notice:""I am requested to ask the boys present to remain in their seats, and inwhich I think they will all feel interested.""Looks of curiosity were interchanged among the boys, and every onethought, ""What\'s coming now?""At this moment a modest knock was heard, and Mr. Rathburn, going to thedoor, admitted Frank. He quietly slipped into the nearest seat.""Your late schoolfellow, Frank Frost,"" proceeded Mr. Rathburn, ""has themerit of originating the plan to which I have referred, and he is nodoubt prepared to unfold it to you.""Mr. Rathburn put on his hat and coat, and left the schoolroom. After hisdeparture Frank rose and spoke modestly, thus:""Boys, I have been thinking for some time past that we were not doingall that we ought in this crisis, which puts in such danger thewelfare of our country. If anything, we boys ought to feel more deeplyinterested than our elders, for while they will soon pass off the stagewe have not yet reached even the threshold of manhood. You will ask mewhat we can do. Let me remind you that when the war broke out the greatwant was, not of volunteers, but of men trained to military exercises.Our regiments were at first composed wholly of raw recruits. In Europe,military instruction is given as a matter of course; and in Germany, andperhaps other countries, young men are obliged to serve for a time inthe army.""I think we ought to profit by the lessons of experience. However thepresent war may turn out, we cannot be certain that other wars will notat some time break out. By that time we shall have grown to manhood, andthe duty of defending our country in arms will devolve upon us. Shouldthat time come, let it not find us unprepared. I propose that weorganize a military company among the boys, and meet for drill atsuch times as we may hereafter agree upon. I hope that any who feelinterested in the matter will express their opinions freely.""Frank sat down, and a number of the boys testified their approbation bystamping with their feet.John Haynes rose, with a sneer upon his face.""I would humbly inquire, Mr. Chairman, for you appear to have assumedthat position, whether you intend to favor us with your valuableservices as drillmaster.""Frank rose, with a flushed face.""I am glad to be reminded of one thing, which I had forgotten,"" he said.""As this is a meeting for the transaction of business, it is proper thatit should be regularly organized. Will some one nominate a chairman?""""Frank Frost!"" exclaimed half a dozen voices.""I thank you for the nomination,"" said Frank, ""but as I have somethingfurther to communicate to the meeting, it will be better to select someone else.""""I nominate Charles Reynolds,"" said one voice.""Second the motion,"" said another.""Those who are in favor of Charles Reynolds, as chairman of thismeeting, will please signify it in the usual manner,"" said Frank.Charles Reynolds, being declared duly elected, advanced to the teacher\'schair.""Mr. Chairman,"" said Frank, ""I will now answer the question just putto me. I do not propose to offer my services as drill-master, but I amauthorized to say that a gentleman whom you have all seen, Mr. HenryMorton, is willing to give instruction till you are sufficientlyadvanced to get along without it.""John Haynes, who felt disappointed at not having been called uponto preside over the meeting, determined to make as much trouble aspossible.""How are we to know that this Morton is qualified to give instruction?""he asked, looking round at the boys.""The gentleman is out of order. He will please address his remarks tothe Chair, and not to the audience,"" said the presiding officer.""I beg pardon, Mr. Chairman,"" said John mockingly. ""I forgot howtenacious some people are of their brief authority.""""Order! order!"" called half a dozen voices.""The gentleman will come to order,"" said the chairman firmly, ""and makeway for others unless he can treat the Chair with proper respect.""""Mr. Chairman,"" said Frank, rising, ""I will mention, for the generalinformation, that Mr. Morton has acted as an officer of militia, andthat I consider his offer a kind one, since it will take up considerableof his time and put him to some trouble.""""I move that Mr. Morton\'s offer be accepted, with thanks,"" said HenryTufts.The motion was seconded by Tom Wheeler, and carried unanimously, withthe exception of one vote. John Haynes sat sullenly in his seat and tookno part in it.""Who shall belong to the company?"" asked the chairman. ""Shall a fixedage be required?""""I move that the age be fixed at eleven,"" said Robert Ingalls.This was objected to as too young, and twelve was finally fixed upon.John Haynes moved not to admit any one who did not attend the academy.Of course, this would exclude Frank, and his motion was not seconded.It was finally decided to admit any above the age of twelve who desiredit, but the boys reserved to themselves the right of rejecting any whoshould conduct himself in a manner to bring disgrace upon them.""Mr. Chairman,"" said Frank, ""in order to get under way as soon aspossible, I have written down an agreement to which those who wish tojoin our proposed company can sign their names. If anybody can think ofanything better, I shall be glad to have it adopted instead of this.""He handed a sheet of paper to the chairman, who read from it thefollowing form of agreement: ""We, the subscribers, agree to form a boys\'volunteer company, and to conform to the regulations which may hereafterbe made for its government.""""If there is no objection, we will adopt this form, and subscribe ournames,"" said the chairman.The motion for adoption being carried, the boys came up one by one andsigned their names.John Haynes would have held back, but for the thought that he might beelected an officer of the new company.""Is there any further business to come before the meeting?"" inquired thepresiding officer.""The boys at Webbington had a company three or four years ago,"" said JoeBarry, ""and they used wooden guns.""""Wooden guns!"" exclaimed Wilbur Summerfield disdainfully. ""You won\'tcatch me training round town with a wooden gun.""""I would remind the last three gentlemen that their remarks should beaddressed to the Chair,"" said the presiding officer. ""Of course, I don\'tcare anything about it, but I think you would all prefer to have themeeting conducted properly.""""That\'s so!"" exclaimed several boys.""Then,"" said the chairman, ""I shall call to order any boy who addressesthe meeting except through me.""""Mr. Chairman,"" said Frank, rising, ""as to the wooden guns, I quiteagree with the last speaker. It would seem too much like boy\'s play, andwe are too much in earnest for that. I have thought of an arrangementwhich can be made if the Selectmen will give their consent. Ten orfifteen years ago, longer than most of us can remember, as my fatherhas told me, there was a militia company in Rossville, whose arms weresupplied and owned by the town. When the company was disbanded themuskets went back to the town, and I believe they are now kept in thebasement of the Town Hall. I presume that we can have the use of themon application. I move that a committee be appointed to lay the matterbefore the Selectmen and ask their permission.""His motion was agreed to.""I will appoint John Haynes to serve on that committee,"" said thechairman, after a pause.This was a politic appointment, as Squire Haynes was one of theSelectmen, and would be gratified at the compliment paid to his son.""I accept the duty,"" said John, rising, and speaking in a tone ofimportance.""Is there any other business to come before the meeting?""""I should like to inquire, Mr. Chairman, when our first meeting willtake place, and where is it to be?"" asked Herbert Metcalf.""I will appoint as a committee to make the necessary arrangements, FrankFrost, Tom Wheeler, and Robert Ingalls. Due notice will be given inschool of the time and place selected, and a written notice will also beposted up in the postoffice.""""Would it not be well, Mr. Chairman,"" suggested Frank, ""to circulatean invitation to other boys not present to-day to join the company? Thelarger our number, the more interest will be felt. I can think of quitea number who would be valuable members. There are Dick Bumstead, andWilliam Chamberlain, and many others.""At the sound of Dick Bumstead\'s name John Haynes looked askance atFrank, but for the moment the thought of Dick\'s agency in the affairof the pig-pen had escaped his recollection, and he looked quiteunconscious of any indirect reference to it.""Will you make a motion to that effect?""""Yes, if necessary.""""Is the motion seconded?""""Second it,"" said Moses Rogers.""I will appoint Wilbur Summerfield and Moses Rogers on that committee,""said the chairman.""I move that the meeting adjourn ipse dixit,"" said Sam Davis, bringingout the latter phrase with considerable emphasis.A roar of laughter followed which shook the schoolhouse to the veryrafters, and then a deafening clamor of applause. The proposer sat downin confusion.""What are you laughing at?"" he burst forth indignantly.""Mr. Chairman,"" said Henry Tufts, struggling with his laughter, ""Isecond the gentleman\'s motion, all except the Latin.""The motion was carried in spite of the manner in which it was worded,and the boys formed little groups, and began eagerly to discuss the planwhich had been proposed. Frank had reason to feel satisfied with thesuccess of his suggestion. Several of the boys came up to him andexpressed their pleasure that he had brought the matter before them.""I say, Frank,"" said Robert Ingalls, ""We\'ll have a bully company.""""Yes,"" said Wilbur Summerfield, ""if John Haynes belongs to it. He\'s abully, and no mistake.""""What\'s that you are saying about me?"" blustered John Haynes, who caughta little of what was said.""Listeners never hear anything good of themselves,"" answered Wilbur.""Say that again, Wilbur Summerfield,"" said John menacingly.""Certainly, if it will do you any good. I said that you were a bully,John Haynes; and there\'s not a boy here that doesn\'t know it to betrue.""""Take care!"" said John, turning white with passion.""While I\'m about it, there\'s something more I want to say,"" continuedWilbur undauntedly. ""Yesterday you knocked my little brother offhis sled and sent him home crying. If you do it again, you will havesomebody else to deal with.""John trembled with anger. It would have done him good to ""pitch into""Wilbur, but the latter looked him in the face so calmly and resolutelythat discretion seemed to him the better part of valor, and with an oathhe turned away.""I don\'t know what\'s got into John Haynes,"" said Wilbur. ""I never likedhim, but now he seems to be getting worse and worse every day.""']"
86,24,Chapter 24,"['XXIII. POMP TAKES MRS. PAYSON PRISONEROld Mrs. Payson, who arrived in Rossville at the same time with HenryMorton, had been invited by her daughter, ""Cynthy Ann,"" to pass thewinter, and had acquiesced without making any very strenuous objections.Her ""bunnit,"" which she had looked upon as ""sp\'ilt,"" had been so farrestored by a skilful milliner that she was able to wear it for best.As this restoration cost but one dollar and a half out of the five whichhad been given her by young Morton, she felt very well satisfied withthe way matters had turned out. This did not, however, by any meansdiminish her rancor against Pomp, who had been the mischievous cause ofthe calamity.""Ef I could only get hold on him,"" Mrs. Payson had remarked on severaloccasions to Cynthy Ann, ""I\'d shake the mischief out of him, ef I diedfor\'t the very next minute.""Mrs. Payson was destined to meet with a second calamity, whichincreased, if possible, her antipathy to the ""young imp.""Being of a social disposition, she was quite in the habit of droppingin to tea at different homes in the village. Having formerly lived inRossville, she was acquainted with nearly all the townspeople, and wentthe rounds about once in two weeks.One afternoon she put her knitting into a black work-bag, which she wasaccustomed to carry on her arm, and, arraying herself in a green cloakand hood, which had served her for fifteen years, she set out to call onMrs. Thompson.Now, the nearest route to the place of her destination lay across afive-acre lot. The snow lay deep upon the ground, but the outer surfacehad become so hard as, without difficulty, to bear a person of ordinaryweight.When Mrs. Payson came up to the bars, she said to herself, ""\'Tain\'t sofur to go across lots. I guess I\'ll ventur\'.""She let down a bar and, passing through, went on her way complacently.But, alas, for the old lady\'s peace of mind! She was destined to come tovery deep grief.That very afternoon Pomp had come over to play with Sam Thompson, andthe two, after devising various projects of amusement, had determined tomake a cave in the snow. They selected a part of the field where it haddrifted to the depth of some four or five feet. Beginning at a littledistance, they burrowed their way into the heart of the snow, andexcavated a place about four feet square by four deep, leaving the uppercrust intact, of course, without its ordinary strength.The two boys had completed their task, and were siting down in theirsubterranean abode, when the roof suddenly gave way, and a visitorentered in the most unceremonious manner.The old lady had kept on her way unsuspiciously, using as a cane a fadedblue umbrella, which she carried invariably, whatever the weather.When Mrs. Payson felt herself sinking, she uttered a loud shriek andwaved her arms aloft, brandishing her umbrella in a frantic way. She wasplunged up to her armpits in the snow, and was, of course, placed in avery unfavorable position for extricating herself.The two boys were at first nearly smothered by the descent of snow, butwhen the first surprise was over they recognized their prisoner. I amashamed to say that their feeling was that of unbounded delight, andthey burst into a roar of laughter. The sound, indistinctly heard,terrified the old lady beyond measure, and she struggled frantically toescape, nearly poking out Pomp\'s eye with the point of her umbrella.Pomp, always prompt to repel aggression, in return, pinched her foot.""Massy sakes! Where am I?"" ejaculated the affrighted old lady. ""There\'ssome wild crittur down there. Oh, Cynthy Ann, ef you could see your marmat this moment!""She made another vigorous flounder, and managed to kick Sam in the face.Partly as a measure of self-defense, he seized her ankle firmly.""He\'s got hold of me!"" shrieked the old lady ""Help! help! I shall bemurdered.""Her struggles became so energetic that the boys soon found it expedientto evacuate the premises. They crawled out by the passage they had made,and appeared on the surface of the snow.The old lady presented a ludicrous appearance. Her hood had slipped off,her spectacles were resting on the end of her nose, and she had lost herwork-bag. But she clung with the most desperate energy to the umbrella,on which apparently depended her sole hope of deliverance.""Hi yah!"" laughed Pomp, as he threw himself back on the snow and beganto roll about in an ecstasy of delight.Instantly Mrs. Payson\'s apprehensions changed to furious anger.""So it\'s you, you little varmint, that\'s done this. Jest le\' me get out,and I\'ll whip you so you can\'t stan\'. See ef I don\'t.""""You can\'t get out, missus; yah, yah!"" laughed Pomp. ""You\'s tied, youis, missus.""""Come an\' help me out, this minute!"" exclaimed the old lady, stampingher foot.""Lor\', missus, you\'ll whip me. You said you would.""""So I will, I vum,"" retorted the irate old lady, ratherundiplomatically. ""As true as I live, I\'ll whip you till you can\'tstan\'.""As she spoke, she brandished her umbrella in a menacing manner.""Den, missus, I guess you\'d better stay where you is.""""Oh, you imp. See ef I don\'t have you put in jail. Here, you, SamThompson, come and help me out. Ef you don\'t, I\'ll tell your mother, an\'she\'ll give you the wust lickin\' you ever had. I\'m surprised at you.""""You won\'t tell on me, will you?"" said Sam, irresolutely.""I\'ll see about it,"" said the old lady, in a politic tone.She felt her powerlessness, and that concession must precede victory.""Then, give me the umbrella,"" said Sam, who evidently distrusted her.""You\'ll run off with it,"" said Mrs. Payson suspiciously.""No, I won\'t.""""Well, there \'tis.""""Come here, Pomp, and help me,"" said Sam.Pomp held aloof.""She\'ll whip me,"" he said, shaking his head. ""She\'s an old debble.""""Oh, you--you sarpint!"" ejaculated the old lady, almost speechless withindignation.""You can run away as soon as she gets out,"" suggested Sam.Pomp advanced slowly and warily, rolling his eyes in indecision.""Jest catch hold of my hands, both on ye,"" said Mrs. Payson, ""an\' I\'llgive a jump.""These directions were followed, and the old lady rose to the surface,when, in an evil hour, intent upon avenging herself upon Pomp, she madea clutch for his collar. In doing so she lost her footing and fell backinto the pit from which she had just emerged. Her spectacles droppedoff and, falling beneath her, were broken.She rose, half-provoked and half-ashamed of her futile attempt. It wasnatural that neither of these circumstances should effect an improvementin her temper.""You did it a purpose,"" she said, shaking her fist at Pomp, who stoodabout a rod off, grinning at her discomfiture. ""There, I\'ve gone an\'broke my specs, that I bought two years ago, come fall, of a pedler.I\'ll make you pay for \'em.""""Lor\', missus, I ain\'t got no money,"" said Pomp. ""Nebber had none.""Unfortunately for the old lady, it was altogether probable that Pompspoke the truth this time.""Three and sixpence gone!"" groaned Mrs. Payson. ""Fust my bunnit, an\'then my specs. I\'m the most unfort\'nit\' crittur. Why don\'t you helpme, Sam Thompson, instead of standin\' and gawkin\' at me?"" she suddenlyexclaimed, glaring at Sam.""I didn\'t know as you was ready,"" said Sam. ""You might have been outbefore this, ef you hadn\'t let go. Here, Pomp, lend a hand."" Pomp shookhis head decisively.""Don\'t catch dis chile again,"" he said. ""I\'m goin\' home. Ole woman wantsto lick me.""Sam endeavored to persuade Pomp, but he was deaf to persuasion. Hesquatted down on the snow, and watched the efforts his companion made toextricate the old lady. When she was nearly out he started on a run, andwas at a safe distance before Mrs. Payson was in a situation to pursuehim.The old lady shook herself to make sure that no bones were broken. Next,she sent Sam down into the hole to pick up her bag, and then, finding,on a careful examination, that she had recovered everything, even to theblue umbrella, fetched the astonished Sam a rousing box on the ear.""What did you do that for?"" he demanded in an aggrieved tone.""\'Taint half as much as you deserve,"" said the old lady. ""I\'m goin\' toyour house right off, to tell your mother what you\'ve been a-doin\'. Efyou was my child, I\'d beat you black and blue.""""I wish I\'d left you down there,"" muttered Sam.""What\'s that?"" demanded Mrs. Payson sharply. ""Don\'t you go to bein\'sassy. It\'ll be the wuss for ye. You\'ll come to the gallows some time,ef you don\'t mind your p\'s and q\'s. I might \'ave stayed there till Idied, an\' then you\'d have been hung.""""What are, you jawing about?"" retorted Sam. ""How could I know you wascomin\'?""""You know\'d it well enough,"" returned the old lady. ""You\'ll bring yourmother\'s gray hairs with sorrer to the grave.""""She ain\'t got any gray hairs,"" said Sam doggedly.""Well, she will have some, ef she lives long enough. I once know\'d a boyjust like you, an\' he was put in jail for stealin\'.""""I ain\'t a-goin to stay and be jawed that way,"" said Sam. ""You won\'tcatch me pulling you out of a hole again. I wouldn\'t have you for agrandmother for all the world. Tom Baldwin told me, only yesterday, thatyou was always a-hectorin\' him.""Tom Baldwin was the son of Cynthy Ann, and consequently old Mrs.Payson\'s grandson.""Did Tom Baldwin tell you that?"" demanded the old lady abruptly, lookingdeeply incensed.""Yes, he did.""""Well, he\'s the ungratefullest cub that I ever sot eyes on,"" exclaimedhis indignant grandmother. ""Arter all I\'ve done for him. I\'m knittin\' apair of socks for him this blessed minute. But he sha\'n\'t have \'em. I\'llgive \'em to the soldiers, I vum. Did he say anything else?""""Yes, he said he should be glad when you were gone.""""I\'ll go right home and tell Cynthy Ann,"" exclaimed Mrs. Payson, ""an\'if she don\'t w\'ip him I will. I never see such a bad set of boys as isgrowin\' up. There ain\'t one on \'em that isn\'t as full of mischief as anut is of meat. I\'ll come up with them, as true as I live.""Full of her indignation, Mrs. Payson gave up her proposed call on Mrs.Thompson, and, turning about, hurried home to lay her complaint beforeCynthy Ann.""I\'m glad she\'s gone,"" said Sam, looking after her, as with resolutesteps she trudged along, punching the snow vigorously with the pointof her blue cotton umbrella. ""I pity Tom Baldwin; if I had such agrandmother as that, I\'d run away to sea. That\'s so!""']"

86,26,Chapter 26,"['FROM HARDEEA few rods east of the post-office, on the opposite side of the street,was a two-story building used as an engine-house, The second storyconsisted of a hall used for company meetings. This the fire companyobligingly granted to the boys as a drill-room during the inclementseason, until the weather became sufficiently warm to drill out ofdoors.On the Monday afternoon succeeding the preliminary meeting at theacademy, about thirty boys assembled in this hall, pursuant to anotice which had been given at school and posted up at the tavern andpost-office.At half-past two Frank entered, accompanied by Mr. Morton.Some of the boys were already acquainted with him, and came up to speak.He had a frank, cordial way with boys, which secured their favor atfirst sight.""Well, boys,"" said he pleasantly, ""I believe I am expected to makesoldiers of you.""""Yes, sir,"" said Charles Reynolds respectfully: ""I hope we shall learnreadily and do credit to your instructions.""""I have no fear on that score,"" was the reply. ""Perhaps you may havesome business to transact before we commence our lessons. If so, I willsit down a few minutes and wait till you are ready.""A short business meeting was held, organized as before.John Haynes reported that he had spoken to his father, and the questionof allowing the boys the use of the muskets belonging to the townwould be acted upon at the next meeting of the Selectmen. Squire Haynesthought that the request would be granted.""What are we going to do this afternoon?"" asked Robert Ingalls.""I can answer that question, Mr. Chairman,"" said Henry Morton. ""We arenot yet ready for muskets. I shall have to drill you first in the properposition of a soldier, and the military step. Probably it will be a weekbefore I shall wish to place muskets into your hands. May I inquire howsoon there will be a meeting of the Selectmen?""John Haynes announced that the next meeting would be held in less than aweek.""Then there will be no difficulty as to the muskets,"" said Mr. Morton.Wilbur Summerfield reported that he had extended an invitation to boysnot connected with the academy to join the company. Several were nowpresent. Dick Bumstead, though not able to attend that day, would cometo the next meeting. He thought they would be able to raise a company offifty boys.This report was considered very satisfactory.Tom Wheeler arose and inquired by what name the new company would becalled.""I move,"" said Robert Ingalls, ""that we take the name of the RossvilleHome Guards.""""If the enemy should invade Rossville, you\'d be the first to run,""sneered John Haynes.""Not unless I heard it before you,"" was the quick reply.There was a general laugh, and cries of ""Bully for you, Bob!"" wereheard.""Order!"" cried the chairman, pounding the table energetically. ""Suchdisputes cannot be allowed. I think we had better defer obtaining a namefor our company till we find how well we are likely to succeed.""This proposal seemed to be acquiesced in by the boys generally. Thebusiness meeting terminated, and Mr. Morton was invited to commence hisinstructions.""The boys will please form themselves in a line,"" said the teacher, in aclear, commanding voice.This was done.The positions assumed were, most of them, far from military. Some stoodwith their legs too far apart, others with one behind the other, somewith the shoulders of unequal height. Frank alone stood correctly,thanks to the private instructions he had received.""Now, boys,"" said Mr. Morton, ""when I say \'attention!\' you must all lookat me and follow my directions implicitly. Attention and subordinationare of the first importance to a soldier. Let me say, to begin with,that, with one exception, you are all standing wrong.""Here there was a general shifting of positions. Robert Ingalls, who hadbeen standing with his feet fifteen inches apart, suddenly brought themclose together in a parallel position. Tom Wheeler, who had been restinghis weight mainly on the left foot, shifted to the right. Moses Rogers,whose head was bent over so as to watch his feet, now threw it so farback that he seemed to be inspecting the ceiling. Frank alone remainedstationary.Mr. Morton smiled at the changes elicited by his remarks, and proceededto give his first command.""Heels on the same line!"" he ordered.All the boys turned their heads, and there was a noisy shuffling offeet.""Quit crowding, Tom Baldwin!"" exclaimed Sam Rivers in an audible tone.""Quit crowding, yourself,"" was the reply. ""You\'ve got more room than I,now.""""Silence in the ranks!"" said the instructor authoritatively. ""FrankFrost, I desire you to see that the boys stand at regular distances.""This was accomplished.""Turn out your feet equally, so as to form a right angle with eachother. So.""Mr. Morton illustrated his meaning practically. This was very necessary,as some of the boys had very confused ideas as to what was meant by aright angle.After some time this order was satisfactorily carried out.""The knees must be straight. I see that some are bent, as if the weightof the body were too much for them. Not too stiff! Rivers, yours are toorigid. You couldn\'t walk a mile in that way without becoming very tired.There, that is much better. Notice my position.""The boys, after adjusting their positions, looked at the rest to see howthey had succeeded.""Don\'t look at each other,"" said Mr. Morton. ""If you do you will becertain to make blunders. I notice that some of you are standing withone shoulder higher than the other. The shoulders should be square, andthe body should be erect upon the hips. Attention! So!""""Very well. Haynes, you are trying to stand too upright. You must notbend backward. All, incline your bodies a little forward. Frank Ingallsis standing correctly.""""I don\'t think that\'s very soldierly,"" said John Haynes, who feltmortified at being corrected, having flattered himself that he was rightand the rest were wrong.""A soldier shouldn\'t be round-shouldered, or have a slouching gait,""said the instructor quietly; ""but you will find when you come to marchthat the opposite extreme is attended with great inconvenience anddiscomfort. Until then you must depend upon my assurance.""Mr. Morton ran his eye along the line, and observed that most of theboys were troubled about their arms. Some allowed them to hang in stiffrigidity by their sides. One, even, had his clasped behind his back.Others let theirs dangle loosely, swinging now hither, now thither.He commented upon these errors, and added, ""Let your arms hangnaturally, with the elbows near the body, the palm of the hand alittle turned to the front, the little finger behind the seam of thepantaloons. This you will find important when you come to drill withmuskets. You will find that it will economize space by preventing youroccupying more room than is necessary. Frank, will you show Sam Riversand John Haynes how to hold their hands?""""You needn\'t trouble yourself,"" said John haughtily, but in too lowa voice, as he supposed, for Mr. Morton to hear. ""I don\'t want aclodhopper to teach me.""Frank\'s face flushed slightly, and without a word he passed John andoccupied himself with showing Sam Rivers, who proved more tractable.""No talking in the ranks!"" said Mr. Morton, in a tone of authority. ""Ifany boy wishes to ask any explanation of me he may do so, but it is abreach of discipline to speak to each other.""""My next order will be, \'Faces to the front!\'"" he resumed, after a pause.""Nothing looks worse than to see a file of men with heads turned invarious directions. The eyes should be fixed straight before you,striking the ground at about fifteen paces forward.""It required some time to have this direction properly carried out. Halfan hour had now passed, and some of the boys showed signs of weariness.""I will now give you a little, breathing-spell for ten minutes,"" saidMr. Morton. ""After this we will resume our exercises.""The boys stretched their limbs, and began to converse in an animatedstrain about the lesson which they had just received.At the expiration of ten minutes the lesson was resumed, and someadditional directions were given.It will not be necessary for us to follow the boys during the remainderof the lesson. Most of them made very creditable progress, and the linepresented quite a different appearance at the end of the exercise fromwhat it had at the commencement.""I shall be prepared to give you a second lesson on Saturday afternoon,""announced Mr. Morton. ""In the meantime it will be well for you toremember what I have said, and if you should feel inclined to practiceby yourselves, it will no doubt make your progress more rapid.""These remarks were followed by a clapping of hands on the part of theboys--a demonstration of applause which Mr. Morton acknowledged by a bowand a smile.""Well, how do you like it?"" asked Frank Frost of Robert Ingalls.""Oh, it\'s bully fun!"" returned Bob enthusiastically. ""I feel like a heroalready.""""You\'re as much of one now, Bob, as you\'ll ever be,"" said Wilburgood-naturedly.""I wouldn\'t advise you to be a soldier,"" retorted Bob. ""You\'re too fatto run, and would be too frightened to fight.""""I certainly couldn\'t expect to keep up with those long legs of yours,Bob,"" said Wilbur, laughing.The boys dispersed in excellent humor, fully determined to persevere intheir military exercises.']"
86,27,Chapter 27,"['XXV. ELECTION OF OFFICERSFor the six weeks following, Mr. Morton gave lessons twice a week to theboys. At the third lesson they received their muskets, and thenceforthdrilled with them. A few, who had not been present at the first twolessons, and were consequently ignorant of the positions, Mr. Mortonturned over to Frank, who proved an efficient and competent instructor.At the end of the twelfth lesson, Mr. Morton, after giving the order""Rest!"" addressed the boys as follows:""Boys, we have now taken twelve lessons together. I have been very muchgratified by the rapid improvement which you have made, and feel that itis due quite as much to your attention as to any instructions of mine.I can say with truth that I have known companies of grown men who havemade less rapid progress than you.""The time has now come when I feel that I can safely leave you toyourselves, There are those among you who are competent to carry on thework which I have commenced. It will be desirable for you at once toform a company organization. As there are but fifty on your muster-roll,being about half the usual number, you will not require as manyofficers. I recommend the election of a captain, first and secondlieutenants, three sergeants and three corporals. You have alreadybecome somewhat accustomed to company drill, so that you will be able togo on by yourselves under the guidance of your officers. If anydoubtful questions should arise, I shall always be happy to give you anyinformation or assistance in my power.""And now, boys, I will bid you farewell in my capacity of instructor,but I need not say that I shall continue to watch with interest yourprogress in the military art.""Here Mr. Morton bowed, and sat down.After the applause which followed his speech had subsided, there wasa silence and hush of expectation among the boys, after which CharlesReynolds rose slowly, and, taking from the seat beside him a package,advanced toward Mr. Morton and made a brief speech of presentation,having been deputed by the boys to perform that duty.""MR MORTON: I stand here in behalf of the boys present, who wish toexpress to you their sense of your kindness in giving them the course oflessons which has just ended. We have taken up much of your time, and nodoubt have tried your patience more than once. If we have improved, asyou were kind enough to say, we feel that it is principally owing to ourgood fortune in having so skilful a teacher. We wish to present you sometestimonial of the regard which we have for you, and accordingly askyour acceptance of this copy of \'Abbott\'s Life of Napoleon.\' We shouldhave been glad to give you something more valuable, but we are sure youwill value the gift for other reasons than its cost.""Here Charles Reynolds sat down, and all eyes were turned toward Mr.Morton. It was evident that he was taken by surprise. It was equallyevident that he was much gratified by this unexpected token of regard.He rose and with much feeling spoke as follows:""My dear boys, for you must allow me to call you so, I can hardly tellyou how much pleasure your kind gift has afforded me. It gives me theassurance, which indeed, I did not need, that you are as much my friendsas I am yours. The connection between us has afforded me much pleasureand satisfaction. In training you to duties which patriotism mayhereafter devolve upon you, though I pray Heaven that long before thattime our terrible civil strife may be at an end, I feel that I havehelped you to do something to show your loyal devotion to the countrywhich we all love and revere."" Here there was loud applause. ""If youwere a few years older, I doubt not that your efforts would be added tothose of your fathers and brothers who are now encountering the perilsand suffering the privations of war. And with a little practise I amproud to say that you would not need to be ashamed of the figure youwould cut in the field.""I have little more to say. I recognize a fitness in the selection ofthe work which you have given me. Napoleon is without doubt the greatestmilitary genius which our modern age has produced. Yet he lacked onevery essential characteristic of a good soldier. He was more devoted tohis own selfish ends than to the welfare of his country. I shall valueyour gift for the good wishes that accompany it, and the recollection ofthis day will be among my pleasantest memories.""Mr. Morton here withdrew in the midst of hearty applause.When he had left the hall a temporary organization for business purposeswas at once effected. Wilbur Summerfield was placed in the chair, andthe meeting proceeded at once to an election of officers.For a week or two past there had been considerable private canvassingamong the boys. There were several who would like to have been electedcaptain, and a number of others who, though not aspiring so high,hoped to be first or second lieutenants. Among the first class was JohnHaynes. Like many persons who are unpopular, he did not seem to be atall aware of the extent of his unpopularity.But there was another weighty reason why the choice of the boyswould never have fallen upon him. Apart from his unpopularity, he wasincompetent for the posts to which he aspired. Probably there were notten boys in the company who were not more proficient in drill than he.This was not owing to any want of natural capacity, but to a feelingthat he did not require much instruction and a consequent lack ofattention to the directions of Mr. Morton. He had frequently beencorrected in mistakes, but always received the correction withsullenness and impatience. He felt in his own mind that he was muchbetter fitted to govern than to obey, forgetting in his ambition that itis those only who have first learned to obey who are best qualified torule others.Desirious of ingratiating himself with the boys, and so securing theirvotes, he had been unusually amiable and generous during the past week.At the previous lesson he had brought half a bushel of apples, fromwhich he had requested the boys to help themselves freely. By this meanshe hoped to attain the object of his ambition.Squire Haynes, too, was interested in the success of his son.""If they elect you captain, John,"" he promised, ""I will furnish youmoney enough to buy a handsome sash and sword.""Besides John, there were several others who cherished secret hopes ofsuccess. Among these were Charles Reynolds and Wilbur Summerfield. Asfor Frank Frost, though he had thought little about it, he could nothelp feeling that he was among those best qualified for office, thoughhe would have been quite content with either of the three highestoffices, or even with the post of orderly sergeant.Among those who had acquitted themselves with the greatest credit wasour old friend Dick Bumstead, whom we remember last as concerned inrather a questionable adventure. Since that time his general behaviorhad very much changed for the better. Before, he had always shirked workwhen it was possible. Now he exhibited a steadiness and industry whichsurprised no less than it gratified his father.This change was partly owing to his having given up some companions whohad done him no good, and, instead, sought the society of Frank. Theenergy and manliness exhibited by his new friend, and the sensible viewswhich he took of life and duty, had wrought quite a revolution in Dick\'scharacter. He began to see that if he ever meant to accomplish anythinghe must begin now. At Frank\'s instance he had given up smoking, and thiscut off one of the temptations which had assailed him. Gradually theopinion entertained of Dick in the village as a ne\'er-do-well wasmodified, and he had come to be called as one of the steady and reliableboys--a reputation not to, be lightly regarded.In the present election Dick did not dream that he could have anyinterest. While he had been interested in the lessons, and done hisbest, he felt that his previous reputation would injure his chance, andhe had made up his mind that he should have to serve in the ranks. Thisdid not trouble him, for Dick, to his credit be it said, was very freefrom jealousy, and had not a particle of envy in his composition. Hepossessed so many good qualities that it would have been a thousandpities if he had kept on in his former course.""You will bring in your votes for captain,"" said the chairman.Tom Wheeler distributed slips of paper among the boys, and there wasforthwith a plentiful show of pencils.""Are the votes all in?"" inquired the chairman, a little later. ""If so,we will proceed to count them.""There was a general hush of expectation while Wilbur Summerfield,the chairman, and Robert Ingalls, the secretary of the meeting, werecounting the votes. John Haynes, was evidently nervous, and fidgetedabout, anxious to learn his fate.At length the count was completed, and Wilbur, rising, announced it asfollows:      Whole number of votes...... 49      Necessary for a choice..... 25      Robert Ingalls.............. 2 votes      John Haynes................. 2  ""      Wilbur Summerfield.......... 4  ""      Moses Rogers................ 4  ""      Charles Reynolds........... 10  ""      Frank Frost................ 27  """"Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of announcing that you have made choiceof Frank Frost as your captain.""Frank rose amid a general clapping of hands, and, with heightened colorbut modest self-possession, spoke as follows ""Boys, I thank you verymuch for this proof of your confidence. All I can say is that I willendeavor to deserve it. I shall no doubt make some mistakes, but I feelsure that you will grant me your indulgence, and not expect too much ofmy inexperience.""This speech was regarded with favor by all except John Haynes, whowould rather have had any one else elected, independent of his owndisappointment, which was great.""You will now prepare your votes for first lieutenant,"" said thepresiding officer.It will be noticed that two votes were cast for John Haynes. One ofthese was thrown by a competitor, who wished to give his vote to someone who stood no possible chance of succeeding, and accordingly selectedJohn on account of his well-known unpopularity. This vote, therefore,was far from being a compliment. As for the other vote, John Hayneshimself best knew by whom it was cast.The boys began to prepare their votes for first lieutenant.John brightened up a little. He felt that it would be something togain this office. But when the result of the balloting was announced itproved that he had but a single vote.There were several scattering votes. The two prominent candidates wereDick Bumstead, who received eight votes, and Charles Reynolds, whoreceived thirty-two, and was accordingly declared elected.No one was more surprised by this announcement than Dick. He felt quitebewildered, not having the slightest expectation of being a candidate.He was almost tempted to believe that the votes had only been cast injest.But Dick was destined to a still greater surprise. At the next vote, forsecond lieutenant, there were five scattering votes. Then came ten forWilbur Summerfield, and Richard Bumstead led off with thirty-four, andwas accordingly declared elected.""Speech! speech!"" exclaimed half a dozen, vociferously.Dick looked a little confused, and tried to escape the call. But theboys were determined to have him up, and he was finally compelled torise, looking and feeling rather awkward But his natural good senseand straightforwardness came to his aid, and he acquitted himself quitecreditably.This was Dick\'s speech:""Boys, I don\'t know how to make speeches, and I s\'pose you know that aswell as I do. I hardly knew who was meant when Richard Bumstead\'s namewas mentioned, having always been called Dick, but if it means me, all Ican say is, that I am very much obliged to you for the unexpected honor.One reason why I did not expect to be elected to any office was becauseI ain\'t as good a scholar as most of you. I am sure there are a greatmany of you who would make better officers than I, but I don\'t thinkthere\'s any that will try harder to do well than I shall.""Here Dick sat down, very much astonished to find that he had actuallymade a speech. His speech was modest, and made a favorable impression,as was shown by the noisy stamping of feet and shouts of ""Bully foryou, Dick!"" ""You\'re a trump!"" and other terms in which boys are wont tosignify their approbation.Through all this John Haynes looked very much disgusted, and seemedhalf-decided upon leaving the room. He had some curiosity, however, tolearn who would be elected to the subordinate offices, and so remained.He had come into the room with the determination not to accept anythingbelow a lieutenancy, but now made up his mind not to reject the post oforderly sergeant if it should be offered to him. The following list ofofficers, however will show that he was allowed no choice in the matter:      Captain, Frank Frost.      First Lieutenant, Charles Reynolds.      Second Lieutenant, Richard Bumstead.      Orderly Sergeant, Wilbur Summerfield.      Second Sergeant, Robert Ingalls.      Third Sergeant, Moses Rogers.      First Corporal, Tom Wheeler.      Second Corporal, Joseph Barry.      Third Corporal, Frank Ingalls.The entire list of officers was now read and received with applause. Ifthere were some who were disappointed, they acquiesced good-naturedly,with one exception.When the applause had subsided, John Haynes rose and, in a voicetrembling with passion, said:""Mr. Chairman, I wish to give notice to all present that I resign myplace as a member of this company. I don\'t choose to serve under suchofficers as you have chosen to-day. I don\'t think they are fit to havecommand.""Here there was a general chorus of hisses, drowning John\'s voicecompletely. After glancing about him a moment in speechless fury, heseized his hat, and left the room in indignant haste, slamming the doorafter him.""He\'s a mean fellow!"" said Frank Ingalls. ""I suppose he expected to becaptain.""""Shouldn\'t wonder,"" said Sam Rivers. ""Anyhow, he\'s a fool to make such afuss about it. As for me,"" he added, with a mirthful glance, ""I amjust as much disappointed as he is. When I came here this afternoon Iexpected I should be elected captain, and I\'d got my speech all ready,but now I\'m sorry that it will have to be wasted.""There was a general burst of laughter, for Sam Rivers, whom everybodyliked for his good nature, was incorrigibly awkward, and had madea larger number of blunders, probably, than any other member of thecompany.""Give us the speech, Sam,"" said Bob Ingalls.""Yes, don\'t let it be wasted.""""Speech! speech!"" cried Joseph Barry.""Very well, gentlemen, if you desire it.""Sam drew from his pocket a blank piece of paper, and pretended to readthe following speech, which he made up on the spur of the moment.""Ahem! gentlemen,"" he commenced, in a pompous tone, assuming an airof importance; ""I am deeply indebted to you for this very unexpectedhonor.""""Oh, very,"" said one of the boys near.""I feel that you have done yourself credit in your selection.""Here there was a round of applause.""I am sorry that some of you are still very awkward, but I hope under myexcellent discipline to make veterans of you in less than no time.""""Good for you!""""You cannot expect me to remain long with you, as I am now in the lineof promotion, and don\'t mean to stop short of a brigadier. But as longas I am your captain I hope you will appreciate your privileges.""Sam\'s speech was followed by a chorus of laughter, in which he joinedheartily himself.As for John\'s defection, nobody seemed to regret it much. It wasgenerally felt that the company would have no difficulty in gettingalong without him.']"
86,28,Chapter 28,"['XXVI. THE REBEL TRAPON the first of April Frank received the following letter from hisfather. It was the more welcome because nearly a month had elapsedsince anything had been received, and the whole family had become quiteanxious:""Dear Frank,"" the letter commenced, ""you are no doubt feeling anxious onaccount of my long silence. You will understand the cause of it whenI tell you that since the date of my last letter I have been for afortnight in the enemy\'s hands as a prisoner. Fortunately, I havesucceeded in effecting my escape. You will naturally be interested tolearn the particulars.""Three weeks since, a lady occupying an estate about five miles distantfrom our camp waited on our commanding officer and made an urgentrequest to have a few soldiers detailed as a guard to protect her andher property from molestation and loss. Our colonel was not at firstdisposed to grant her request, but finally acceded to it, ratherreluctantly, declaring that it was all nonsense. I was selected, withfive other men, to serve as a guard. Mrs. Roberts--for this was hername--appeared quite satisfied to find her request granted, and droveslowly home under our escort.""On arriving, we found a mansion in the old Virginia style, low inelevation, broad upon the ground, and with a piazza extending along thefront. Surrounding it was a good-sized plantation. At a little distancefrom the house was a row of negro huts. These were mostly vacant, theformer occupants having secured their freedom by taking refuge withinour lines.""As sergeant in command--you must know that I have been promoted--Iinquired of Mrs. Roberts what danger she apprehended. Her answers werevague and unsatisfactory. However, she seemed disposed to treat me verycivilly, and at nine o\'clock invited the whole party into the house topartake of a little refreshment. This invitation was very welcome tosoldiers who had not for months partaken of anything better than campfare. It was all the more acceptable because outside a cold rain wasfalling, and the mod was deep and miry.""In the dining-room we found a plentiful meal spread, including hotcoffee, hot corn bread, bacon, and other viands. We were not, however,destined to take our supper in peace. As I was drinking my second cupof coffee I thought I heard a noise outside, and remarked it to Mrs.Roberts.""\'It is only the wind, sergeant,\' said she, indifferently.""It was not long before I became convinced that it was something moreserious. I ordered my men to stand to their arms, in spite of the urgentprotestations of the old lady, and marched them out upon the lawn, justin time to be confronted by twenty or thirty men on horseback, clad inthe rebel uniform.""Resistance against such odds would have been only productive of uselessloss of life, and with my little force I was compelled to surrendermyself a prisoner.""Of course, I no longer doubted that we were the victims of a trick, andhad been lured by Mrs. Roberts purposely to be made prisoners. If I hadhad any doubts on the subject, her conduct would have dissipated them.She received our captors with open arms. They stepped into our places asguests, and the house was thrown open to them. Our arms were taken fromus, our hands pinioned, and a scene of festivity ensued. A cask of winewas brought up from the cellar, and the contents freely distributedamong the rebels, or gray backs, as we call them here.""Once, as Mrs. Roberts passed through the little room where we wereconfined, I said, \'Do you consider this honorable conduct, madam,to lure us here by false representations, and then betray us to ourenemies?\'""\'Yes, I do!\' said she hotly. \'What business have you to come downhere and lay waste our territory? There is no true Southern woman butdespises you heartily, and would do as much as I have, and more, too.You\'ve got my son a prisoner in one of your Yankee prisons. When I heardthat he was taken, I swore to be revenged, and I have kept my word. I\'vegot ten for one, though he\'s worth a hundred such as you!\'""So saying, she swept out of the room, with a scornful look of triumphin her eyes. The next day, as I afterward learned, she sent word to ourcolonel that her house had been unexpectedly attacked by a large partyof the rebels, and that we had been taken prisoners. Her complicity wassuspected, but was not proved till our return to the camp. Of course, afurther guard, which she asked for, to divert suspicion, was refused.""Meanwhile we were carried some twenty miles across the river, andconfined in a building which had formerly been used as a storehouse.""The place was dark and gloomy. There were some dozen others who sharedour captivity. Here we had rather a doleful time. We were supplied withfood three times a day; but the supply was scanty, and we had meatbut once in two days. We gathered that it was intended to send us toRichmond; but from day to day there was a delay in doing so. We decidedthat our chance of escape would be much better then than after wereached the rebel capital. We, therefore, formed a plan for defeatingthe intentions of our captors.""Though the building assigned to us as a prison consisted of twostories, we were confined in the lower part. This was more favorable toour designs. During the night we busied ourselves in loosening two ofthe planks of the flooring, so that we could remove them at any time.Then lowering two of our number into the cellar, we succeeded inremoving enough of the stone foundation to allow the escape of one manat a time through the aperture. Our arrangements were hastened by theassignment of a particular day on which we were to be transferred fromour prison, and conveyed to Richmond. Though we should have been glad toenter the city under some circumstances, we did not feel very desirousof going as prisoners of war.""On the night selected we waited impatiently till midnight. Then, assilently as possible, we removed the planking, and afterwards thestones of the basement wall, and crept through one by one. All this waseffected so noiselessly that we were all out without creating any alarm.We could hear the measured tramp of the sentinel, as he paced up anddown in front of the empty prison. We pictured to ourselves his surprisewhen he discovered, the next morning, that we escaped under his nosewithout his knowing it!""I need not dwell upon the next twenty-four hours. The utmost vigilancewas required to elude the rebel pickets. At last, after nearly twentyhours, during which we had nothing to eat, we walked into camp,exhausted with hunger and fatigue, to the great joy of our comrades fromwhom we had been absent a fortnight.""On receiving information of the manner in which we had been captured,our commanding officer at once despatched me with a detachment of men toarrest Mrs. Roberts and her daughter. Her surprise and dismay at seeingme whom she supposed safe in Richmond were intense. She is still underarrest.""I suppose our campaign will open as soon as the roads are dried up. Themud in Virginia is much more formidable than at the North, and presentsan insuperable, perhaps I should say an unfathomable, obstacle to activeoperations. I hope General Grant will succeed in taking Vicksburg. Theloss of that important stronghold would be a great blow to the rebels.""You ask me, in your last letter, whether I see much of the contrabands.I have talked with a considerable number. One, a very intelligentfellow, had been very much trusted by his master, and had accompaniedhim to various parts of the South. I asked him the question: \'Is ittrue that there are a considerable number of slaves who would prefer toremain in their present condition to becoming free?\'""\'Nebber see any such niggers, massa,\' he answered, shaking his headdecisively. \'We all want to be free. My old massa treated me kindly, butI\'d a left him any minute to be my own man.\'""I hope the time will soon come, when, from Canada to the Gulf, therewill not be a single black who is not his own man. We in the army aredoing what we can, but we must be backed up by those who stay at home.My own feeling is that slavery has received its death-blow. It maycontinue to live for some years, but it has fallen from its pomp andpride of place. It is tottering to its fall. What shall be done withthe negroes in the transition state will be a problem for statesmen toconsider. I don\'t think we need fear the consequences of doing right,and on this subject there can be no doubt of what is right; The apparentinsensibility and brutish ignorance which we find among some of theslaves will wear away under happier influences.""There is a little fellow of perhaps a dozen years who comes into ourcamp and runs of errands and does little services for the men. Yesterdaymorning he came to my tent, and with a grin, said to me, \'De ol\' mandied last night.\'""\'What, your father?\' I inquired in surprise.""\'Yes, massa,\' with another grin: \'Goin\' to tote him off dis mornin\'.\'""As he only lived a quarter of a mile off, I got permission to go overto the house, or cabin, where Scip\'s father had lived.""The outer door was open, and I entered without knocking. A woman wasbending over a washtub at the back part of the room. I looked around mefor the body, but could see no indication of anything having happenedout of the ordinary course.""I thought it possible that Scip had deceived me, and accordingly spoketo the woman, inquiring if she was Scip\'s mother.""She replied in the affirmative.""\'And where is his father?\' I next inquired.""\'Oh, he\'s done dead,\' she said, continuing her washing.""\'When did he die?\'""\'Las\' night, massa.\'""\'And where is the body?\'""\'Toted off, massa, very first t\'ing dis mornin\'.\'""In spite of this case of apparent insensibility, the negro\'s familyattachments are quite as warm naturally as our own. They have littlereason, indeed, to mourn over the loss of a husband or father, since, inmost cases, it is the only portal to the freedom which they covet. Theseparation of families, too, tends, of course, to weaken family ties.While I write these words I cannot help recalling our own happy home,and longing for an hour, if not more, of your society. I am glad thatyou find Mr. Morton so agreeable an inmate. You ought to feel quiteindebted him for his assistance in your studies. I am glad you haveformed a boy\'s company. It is very desirable that the elements ofmilitary science should be understood even by boys, since upon them mustsoon devolve the defense of their country from any blows that maybe directed against her, whether by foes from within or enemies fromabroad.""The coming season will be a busy one with you. When you receive thisletter it will be about time for you to begin to plow whatever land isto be planted. As I suggested in my first letter from camp, I shouldlike you to devote some space-perhaps half an acre-to the culture ofonions. We find them very useful for promoting health in the army. Theyare quite high on account of the largely increased demand, so that itwill be a good crop for financial reasons.""(Here followed some directions with regard to the spring planting, whichwe omit, as not likely to interest our readers.) The letter ended thus:""It is nearly time for me to mail this letter, and it is already muchlonger than I intended to write. May God keep you all in health andhappiness is the fervent wish of""Your affectionate father,""HENRY FROST.""The intelligence that their father had been a prisoner made quite asensation among the children. Charlie declared that Mrs. Roberts was awicked woman, and he was glad she was put in prison--an expression ofjoy in which the rest fully participated.']"
86,29,Chapter 29,"['XXVII. POMP\'S LIGHT INFANTRY TACTICSLittle Pomp continued to pursue his studies under Frank as a teacher. Bydegrees his restlessness diminished, and, finding Frank firm in exactinga certain amount of study before he would dismiss him, he concluded thatit was best to study in earnest, and so obtain the courted freedom asspeedily as possible. Frank had provided for his use a small chair,which he had himself used when at Pomp\'s age, but for this the littlecontraband showed no great liking. He preferred to throw himself on arug before the open fire-place, and, curling up, not unlike a cat, beganto pore over his primer.Frank often looked up from his own studies and looked down with anamused glance at little Pomp\'s coal-back face and glistening eyesriveted upon the book before him. There was no lack of brightness orintelligence in the earnest face of his young pupil. He seemed to bestudying with all his might. In a wonderfully short time he would uncoilhimself, and, coming to his teacher, would say, ""I guess I can say it,Mass\' Frank.""Finding how readily Pomp learned his lessons, Frank judiciouslylengthened them, so that, in two or three months, Pomp could read wordsof one syllable with considerable ease, and promised very soon to readas well as most boys of his age.Frank also took considerable pains to cure Pomp of his mischievouspropensities, but this he found a more difficult task than teachinghim to read. Pomp had an innate love of fun which seemed almostirrepressible, and his convictions of duty sat too lightly upon himto interfere very seriously with its gratification. One adventure intowhich he was led came near having serious consequences.Pomp, in common with other village boys of his age, had watched withconsiderable interest the boys \'company, as they drilled publicly orparaded through the main street, and he had conceived a strong desire toget hold of a musket, to see if he, too, could not go through with themanual.Frank generally put his musket carefully away, only bringing it outwhen it was needful. One morning, however, he had been out on ahunting-expedition, and on his return left the musket in the corner ofthe shed.Pomp espied it when he entered the house, and resolved, if possible, totake temporary possession of it after his lesson was over. Having thisin view, he worked with an uncommon degree of industry, and in less timethan usual had learned and said his lesson.""Very well, Pomp,"" said his teacher approvingly. ""You have workedunusually well to-day. If you keep on you will make quite a scholar someday.""""I\'s improvin\', isn\'t I?"" inquired Pomp, with an appearance of interest.""Yes, Pomp, you have improved rapidly. By and by you can teach yourmother how to read.""""She couldn\'t learn, Mass\' Frank. She\'s poor ignorant nigger.""""You shouldn\'t speak so of your mother, Pomp. She\'s a good mother toyou, and works hard to earn money to support you.""""Yes, Mass\' Frank,"" said Pomp, who was getting impatient to go. ""I guessI\'ll go home and help her.""Frank thought that what he had said was producing a good effect. He didnot know the secret of Pomp\'s haste.Pomp left the room, and, proceeding to the wood-shed, hastily possessedhimself of the musket. In a stealthy manner he crept with it through afield behind the house, until he got into the neighboring woods.He found it a hard tug to carry the gun, which was heavier than thosemade at the present day. At length he reached an open space in thewoods, only a few rods from the road which led from the farmhouse, pastthe shanty occupied by old Chloe. As this road was not much traveled,Pomp felt pretty safe from discovery, and accordingly here it was thathe halted, and made preparations to go through the manual.""It begins dis yer way,"" said Pomp, after a little reflection.Grasping the musket with one hand he called out in an important tone:""\'Tention, squab!""For the benefit of the uninitiated it may be explained that Pomp meant""Attention, squad!""""S\'port arms!""Pomp found it considerably easier to give the word of command thanto obey it. With some difficulty he succeeded in accomplishingthis movement, and proceeded with the manual, with several originalvariations which would have astonished a military instructor.Meanwhile, though Pomp did not realize it, he was exposing himselfto considerable danger. The gun had been loaded with buckshot in themorning, and the charge had not been withdrawn.It seemed to be the lot of poor Mrs. Payson to suffer fright or disasterwhenever she encountered Pomp, and this memorable afternoon was to makeno exception to the rule.""Cynthy Ann,"" she said to her daughter, in the afternoon, ""I guess I\'llgo and spend the arternoon with Mis\' Forbes. I hain\'t been to see herfor nigh a month, and I calc\'late she\'ll be glad to see me. Besides,she ginerally bakes Thursdays, an\' mos\' likely she\'ll have some hotgingerbread. I\'m partic\'larly fond of gingerbread, an\' she does know howto make it about the best of anybody I know on. You needn\'t wait supperfor me, Cynthy Ann, for ef I don\'t find Mis\' Forbes to home I\'ll go onto Mis\' Frost\'s.""Mrs. Payson put on her cloak and hood, and, armed with the work-bag andthe invariable blue cotton umbrella, sallied out. Mrs. Forbes lived atthe distance of a mile, but Mrs. Payson was a good walker for a woman ofher age, and less than half an hour brought her to the door of the brownfarmhouse in which Mrs. Forbes lived.She knocked on the door with the handle of her umbrella. The summons wasanswered by a girl of twelve.""How dy do, Betsy?"" said Mrs. Payson. ""Is your ma\'am to home?""""No, she\'s gone over to Webbington to spend two or three days with AuntPrudence.""""Then she won\'t be home to tea,"" said Mrs. Payson, considerablydisappointed.""No, ma\'am, I don\'t expect her before to-morrow.""""Well, I declare for\'t, I am disapp\'inted,"" said the old ladyregretfully. ""I\'ve walked a mile on puppus to see her. I\'m most tuckeredout.""""Won\'t you step in and sit down?""""Well, I don\'t keer ef I do a few minutes. I feel like to drop. Do youdo the cooking while you maam\'s gone?""""No, she baked up enough to last before she went away.""""You hain\'t got any gingerbread in the house?"" asked Mrs. Payson, withsubdued eagerness. ""I always did say Mis\' Forbes beat the world atmakin\' gingerbread.""""I\'m very sorry, Mrs. Payson, but we ate the last for supper lastnight.""""Oh, dear!"" sighed the old lady, ""I feel sort of faint--kinder gone atthe stomach. I didn\'t have no appetite at dinner, and I s\'pose it don\'tagree with me walkin\' so fur on an empty stomach.""""Couldn\'t you eat a piece of pie?"" asked Betsy sympathizingly.""Well,"" said the old lady reflectively, ""I don\'t know but I could eatjest a bite. But you needn\'t trouble yourself. I hate to give trouble toanybody.""""Oh, it won\'t be any trouble,"" said Betsy cheerfully.""And while you\'re about it,"" added Mrs. Payson, ""ef you have got any ofthat cider you give me when I was here before, I don\'t know but I couldworry down a little of it.""""Yes, we\'ve got plenty. I\'ll bring it in with the pie.""""Well,"" murmured the old lady, ""I\'ll get something for my trouble. Iguess I\'ll go and take supper at Mis\' Frost\'s a\'terward.""Betsy brought in a slice of apple and one of pumpkin pie, and set themdown before the old lady. In addition she brought a generous mug ofcider.The old lady\'s eyes brightened, as she saw this substantial refreshment.""You\'re a good gal, Betsy,"" she said in the overflow of her emotions.""I was saying to my darter yesterday that I wish all the gals round herewas as good and considerate as you be.""""Oh, no, Mrs. Payson,"" said Betsy modestly. ""I ain\'t any better thangirls generally.""""Yes, you be. There\'s my granddarter, Jane, ain\'t so respectful as she\'darter be to her old grandma\'am. I often tell her that when she gets tohave children of her own, she\'ll know what tis to be a pilgrim an\' asojourner on the arth without nobody to consider her feelin\'s. Yourcider is putty good."" Here the old lady took a large draft, and set downthe mug with a sigh of satisfaction. ""It\'s jest the thing to take whena body\'s tired. It goes to the right spot. Cynthy Ann\'s husband didn\'thave none made this year. I wonder ef your ma would sell a quart or twoof it.""""You can have it and welcome, Mrs. Payson.""""Can I jest as well as not? Well, that\'s kind. But I didn\'t expect youto give it to me.""""Oh, we have got plenty.""""I dunno how I can carry it home,"" said the lady hesitatingly. ""I wonderef some of your folks won\'t be going up our way within a day or two.""""We will send it. I guess father\'ll be going up to-morrow.""""Then ef you can spare it you might send round a gallon, an\' ef there\'sanything to pay I\'ll pay for it.""This little business arrangement being satisfactorily adjusted, and thepie consumed, Mrs. Payson got up and said she must be going.""I\'m afraid you haven\'t got rested yet, Mrs. Payson.""""I ain\'t hardly,"" was the reply; ""but I guess I shall stop on the way atMis\' Frost\'s. Tell your ma I\'ll come up an\' see her ag\'in afore long.""""Yes, ma\'am.""""An\' you won\'t forget to send over that cider?""""No, ma\'am.""""I\'m ashamed to trouble ye, but their ain\'t anybody over to ourhouse that I can send. There\'s Tom grudges doin\' anything for his oldgrandma\'am. A\'ter all that I do for him, too! Good-by!""The old lady set out on her way to Mrs. Frost\'s.Her road lay through the woods, where an unforeseen danger lay in waitfor her.Meanwhile Pomp was pursuing military science under difficulties. Theweight of the musket made it very awkward for him to handle. Severaltimes he got out of patience with it, and apostrophized it in termsfar from complimentary. At last, in one of his awkward maneuvers, heaccidentally pulled the trigger. Instantly there was a loud report,followed by a piercing shriek from the road. The charge had enteredold Mrs. Payson\'s umbrella and knocked it out of her hand. The oldlady fancied herself hit, and fell backward, kicking energetically, andscreaming ""murder"" at the top of her lungs.The musket had done double execution. It was too heavily loaded, and asit went off, \'kicked,\' leaving Pomp, about as scared as the old lady,sprawling on the ground.Henry Morton was only a few rods off when he heard the explosion. He atonce ran to the old lady\'s assistance, fancying her hurt. She shriekedthe louder on his approach, imagining that he was a robber, and hadfired at her.""Go away!"" she cried, in affright. ""I ain\'t got any money. I\'m a poor,destitute widder!""""What do you take me for?"" inquired Mr. Morton, somewhat amazed at thismode of address.""Ain\'t you a highwayman?"" asked the old lady.""If you look at me close I think you will be able to answer thatquestion for yourself.""The old lady cautiously rose to a sitting posture, and, mechanicallyadjusting her spectacles, took a good look at the young man.""Why, I declare for it, ef it ain\'t Mr. Morton! I thought \'twas you thatfired at me.""""I hope you are not hurt,"" said Mr. Morton, finding a difficulty inpreserving his gravity.""I dunno,"" said the old lady dubiously, pulling up her sleeve, andexamining her arm. ""I don\'t see nothin\'; but I expect I\'ve had someinjury to my inards. I feel as ef I\'d had a shock somewhere. Do youthink he\'ll fire again?"" she asked, with a sudden alarm.""You need not feel alarmed,"" was the soothing reply. ""It was no doubt anaccident.""Turning suddenly, he espied Pomp peering from behind a tree, with eyesand mouth wide open. The little contraband essayed a hasty flight; butMr. Morton, by a masterly flank movement, came upon him, and broughtforward the captive kicking and struggling.""Le\' me go!"" said Pomp. ""I ain\'t done noffin\'!""""Didn\'t you fire a gun at this lady?""""No,"" said Pomp boldly. ""Wish I may be killed ef I did!""""I know \'twas you--you--you imp!"" exclaimed Mrs. Payson, in violentindignation. ""I seed you do it. You\'re the wust boy that ever lived, andyou\'ll be hung jest as sure as I stan\' here!""""How did it happen, Pomp?"" asked Mr. Morton quietly.""It jest shooted itself!"" said Pomp, in whom the old lady\'s wordsinspired a vague feeling of alarm. ""I \'clare to gracious, Mass\' Morton,it did!""""Didn\'t you have the gun in your hand, Pomp? Where did you get it?""""I jest borrered it of Mass\' Frank, to play sojer a little while,"" saidPomp reluctantly.""Does he know that you have got it?""""I \'clare I done forgot to tell him,"" said Pomp reluctantly.""Will you promise never to touch it again?""""Don\'t want to!"" ejaculated Pomp, adding spitefully, ""He kick me over!""""I\'m glad on\'t,"" said the old lady emphatically, with a grim air ofsatisfaction. ""That\'ll l\'arn you not to fire it off at your eldersag\'in. I\'ve a great mind to box your ears, and sarve you right, too.""Mrs. Payson advanced, to effect her purpose; but Pomp was wary, and,adroitly freeing himself from Mr. Morton\'s grasp, butted at the old ladywith such force that she would have fallen backward but for the timelyassistance of Mr. Morton, who sprang to her side. Her bag fell to theground, and she struggled to regain her lost breath.""Oh!"" groaned the old lady, gasping for breath, ""he\'s mos\' knocked thebreath out of me. I sha\'n\'t live long a\'ter such a shock. I\'m achin\' allover. Why did you let him do it?""""He was too quick for me, Mrs. Payson. I hope you feel better.""""I dunno as I shall ever feel any better,"" said Mrs. Payson gloomily.""If Cynthy Ann only knew how her poor old ma\'am had been treated! Idunno as I shall live to get home!""""Oh, yes, you will,"" said the young man cheerfully, ""and live to see agood many years more. Would you like to have me attend you home?""""I ain\'t got strength to go so fur,"" said Mrs. Payson, who had notgiven up her plan of taking tea out. ""I guess I could go as fur asMis\' Frost\'s, an\' mebbe some on you will tackle up an\' carry me back toCynthy Ann\'s a\'ter tea.""Arrived at the farmhouse, Mrs. Payson indulged in a long detail ofgrievances; but it was observed that they did not materially affect herappetite at tea.The offending musket was found by Frank under a tree, where Pomp haddropped it when it went off.']"
86,30,Chapter 30,"['XXVIII. JOHN HAYNES HAS A NARROW ESCAPEJohn Haynes found the time hang heavily upon his hand after hiswithdrawal from the boys\' volunteer company. All the boys with whom hehad been accustomed to associate belonged to it, and in theirinterest could talk of nothing else. To him, on the contrary, it was adisagreeable subject. In the pleasant spring days the company came outtwice a week, and went through company drill on the Common, under thecommand of Frank, or Captain Frost, as he was now called.Had Frank shown himself incompetent, and made himself ridiculous byblunders, it would have afforded John satisfaction. But Frank, thoroughin all things, had so carefully prepared himself for his duties thathe never made a mistake, and always acquitted himself so creditably andwith such entire self-possession, that his praises were in every mouth.Dick Bumstead, too, manifested an ambition to fill his secondlieutenancy, to which, so much to his own surprise, he had been elected,in such a manner as to justify the company in their choice. In this hefully succeeded. He had become quite a different boy from what he waswhen we first made his acquaintance. He had learned to respect himself,and perceived with great satisfaction that he was generally respected bythe boys. He no longer attempted to shirk his work in the shop, andhis father now spoke of him with complacency, instead of complaint asformerly.""Yes,"" said he one day, ""Dick\'s a good boy. He was always smart, butrather fly-a-way. I couldn\'t place any dependence upon him once, but itis not so now. I couldn\'t wish for a better boy. I don\'t know what hascome over him, but I hope it\'ll last.""Dick happened to overhear his father speaking thus to a neighbor, andhe only determined, with a commendable feeling of pride, that the changethat had given his father so much pleasure should last. It does a boygood to know that his efforts are appreciated. In this case it had ahappy effect upon Dick, who, I am glad to say, kept his resolution.It has been mentioned that John was the possessor of a boat. Finding onegreat source of amusement cut off, and being left very much to himself,he fell back upon this, and nearly every pleasant afternoon he mightbe seen rowing on the river above the dam. He was obliged to confinehimself to this part of the river, since, in the part below the dam, thewater was too shallow.There is one great drawback, however, upon the pleasure of owning arowboat. It is tiresome to row single-handed after a time. So John foundit, and, not being overfond of active exertion, he was beginning toget weary of this kind of amusement when all at once a new plan wassuggested to him. This was, to rig up a mast and sail, and thus obviatethe necessity of rowing.No sooner had this plan suggested itself than he hastened to put it intoexecution. His boat was large enough to bear a small mast, so there wasno difficulty on that head. He engaged the village carpenter to effectthe desired change. He did not choose to consult his father on thesubject, fearing that he might make some objection either on score ofsafety or expense, while he had made up his mind to have his own way.When it was finished, and the boat with its slender mast and white sailfloated gently on the quiet bosom of the stream, John\'s satisfactionwas unbounded.""You\'ve got a pretty boat,"" said Mr. Plane, the carpenter. ""I supposeyou know how to manage it?"" he added inquiringly.""Yes,"" answered John carelessly, ""I\'ve been in a sailboat beforeto-day.""Mr. Plane\'s doubts were set at rest by John\'s confident manner, and hesuppressed the caution which he had intended to give him. It made littledifference, however, for John was headstrong, and would have been prettycertain to disregard whatever he might say.It was true that this was not the first time John had been in asailboat; but if not the first, it was only the second. The firstoccasion had been three years previous, and at that time he had hadnothing to do with the management of the boat--a very importantmatter. It was in John\'s nature to be over-confident, and he thoughthe understood merely from observation exactly how a boat ought to bemanaged. As we shall see, he found out his mistake.The first day after his boat was ready John was greatly disappointedthat there was no wind. The next day, as if to make up for it, the windwas very strong. Had John possessed a particle of prudence he would haveseen that it was no day to venture out in a sailboat. But he was not inthe habit of curbing his impatience, and he determined that he would notwait till another day. He declared that it was a mere ""capful of wind,""and would be all the better for the purpose.""It\'s a tip-top wind. Won\'t it make my boat scud,"" he said to himselfexultantly, as he took his place, and pushed off from shore.Henry Morton had been out on a walk, and from the summit of a littlehill near the river-bank espied John pushing off in his boat.""He\'ll be sure to capsize,"" thought the young man in alarm. ""Even if heis used to a sailboat he is very imprudent to put out in such a wind; Iwill hurry down and save him if I can.""He hurried to the bank of the river, reaching it out of breath.John was by this time some distance out. The wind had carried him alongfinely, the boat scudding, as he expressed it. He was congratulatinghimself on the success of his trial trip, when all at once a flaw struckthe boat. Not being a skillful boatman he was wholly unprepared for it,and the boat upset.Struggling in terror and confusion, John struck out for the shore. Buthe was not much of a swimmer, and the suddenness of the accident hadunnerved him, and deprived him of his self-possession. The current ofthe river was rapid, and he would inevitably have drowned but for theopportune assistance of Mr. Morton.The young man had no sooner seen the boat capsize, than he flung off hiscoat and boots, and, plunging into the river, swam vigorously toward theimperiled boy.Luckily for John, Mr. Morton was, though of slight frame, muscular,and an admirable swimmer. He reached him just as John\'s strokes werebecoming feebler and feebler; he was about to give up his unequalstruggle with the waves.""Take hold of me,"" he said. ""Have courage, and I will save you.""John seized him with the firm grip of a drowning person, and nearlyprevented him from striking out. But Mr. Morton\'s strength served himin good stead; and, notwithstanding the heavy burden, he succeeded inreaching the bank in safety, though with much exhaustion.John no sooner reached the bank than he fainted away. The great dangerwhich he had just escaped, added to his own efforts, had proved too muchfor him.Mr. Morton, fortunately knew how to act in such emergencies. By the useof the proper remedies, he was fortunately brought to himself, and hispreserver offered to accompany him home. John still felt giddy, andwas glad to accept Mr. Morton\'s offer. He knew that his father wouldbe angry with him for having the boat fitted up without his knowledge,especially as he had directed Mr. Plane to charge it to his father\'saccount. Supposing that Squire Haynes approved, the carpenter made noobjections to doing so. But even the apprehension of his father\'s angerwas swallowed up by the thought of the great peril from which he hadjust escaped, and the discomfort of the wet clothes which he had on.Mr. Morton, too, was completely wet through, with the exception of hiscoat, and but for John\'s apparent inability to go home alone, would atonce have returned to his boarding-house to exchange his wet clothes fordry ones.It so happened that Squire Haynes was sitting at a front window, and sawMr. Morton and his son as they entered the gate and came up the graveledwalk. He had never met Mr. Morton, and was surprised now at seeing himin John\'s company. He had conceived a feeling of dislike to the youngman, for which he could not account, while at the same time he felt astrong curiosity to know more of him.When they came nearer, he perceived the drenched garments, and went tothe door himself to admit them.""What\'s the matter, John?"" he demanded hastily, with a contraction ofthe eyebrows.""I\'m wet!"" said John shortly.""It is easy to see that. But how came you so wet?""""I\'ve been in the river,"" answered John, who did not seem disposed tovolunteer any particulars of his adventure.""How came you there?""""Your son\'s boat capsized,"" explained Mr. Morton; ""and, as you willjudge from my appearance, I jumped in after him. I should advise him tochange his clothing, or he will be likely to take cold.""Squire Haynes looked puzzled.""I don\'t see how a large rowboat like his could capsize,"" he said; ""hemust have been very careless.""""It was a sailboat,"" explained John, rather reluctantly.""A sailboat! Whose?""""Mine.""""I don\'t understand at all.""""I had a mast put in, and a sail rigged up, two or three days since,""said John, compelled at last to explain.""Why did you do this without my permission?"" demanded the squireangrily.""Perhaps,"" said Mr. Morton quietly, ""it will be better to postponeinquiries until your son has changed his clothes.""Squire Haynes, though somewhat irritated by this interference, bethoughthimself that it would be churlish not to thank his son\'s preserver.""I am indebted to you, sir,"" he said, ""for your agency in saving thelife of this rash boy. I regret that you should have got wet.""""I shall probably experience nothing more than temporary inconvenience.""""You have been some months in the village, I believe, Mr. Morton. Itrust you will call at an early day, and enable me to follow up thechance which has made us acquainted.""""I seldom make calls,"" said Mr. Morton, in a distant tone. ""Yet,"" addedhe, after a pause, ""I may have occasion to accept your invitation someday. Good morning, sir.""""Good morning,"" returned the squire, looking after him with anexpression of perplexity.""He boards at the Frosts\', doesn\'t he, John?"" asked Squire Haynes,turning to his son.""Yes, sir.""""There\'s something in his face that seems familiar,"" mused the squireabsently. ""He reminds me of somebody, though I can\'t recall who.""It was not long before the squire\'s memory was refreshed, and heobtained clearer information respecting the young man, and the errandwhich had brought him to Rossville. When that information came, itwas so far from pleasing that he would willingly have postponed itindefinitely.']"
86,31,Chapter 31,"['XXIX. MR. MORTON\'S STORYThe planting-season was over. For a month Frank had workedindustriously, in conjunction with Jacob Carter. His father had senthim directions so full and minute, that he was not often obliged to callupon Farmer Maynard for advice. The old farmer proved to be very kindand obliging. Jacob, too, was capable and faithful, so that the farm workwent on as well probably as if Mr. Frost had been at home.One evening toward the middle of June, Frank walked out into the fieldswith Mr. Morton. The corn and potatoes were looking finely. The gardenvegetables were up, and to all appearance doing well. Frank surveyed thescene with a feeling of natural pride.""Don\'t you think I would make a successful farmer, Mr. Morton?"" heasked.""Yes, Frank; and more than this, I think you will be likely to succeedin any other vocation you may select.""""I am afraid you\'re flattering me, Mr. Morton.""""Such is not my intention, Frank, but I like to award praise where Ithink it due. I have noticed in you a disposition to be faithful towhatever responsibility is imposed upon you, and wherever I see that Ifeel no hesitation in predicting a successful career.""""Thank you,"" said Frank, looking very much pleased with the compliment.""I try to be faithful. I feel that father has trusted me more than it isusual to trust boys of my age, and I want to show myself worthy of hisconfidence.""""You are fortunate in having a father, Frank,"" said the young man, witha shade of sadness in his voice. ""My father died before I was of yourage.""""Do you remember him?"" inquired Frank, with interest.""I remember him well. He was always kind to me. I never remember tohave received a harsh word from him. It is because he was so kind andindulgent to me that I feel the more incensed against a man who tookadvantage of his confidence to defraud him, or, rather, me, throughhim.""""You have never mentioned this before, Mr. Morton.""""No. I have left you all in ignorance of much of my history. Thismorning, if it will interest you, I propose to take you into myconfidence.""The eagerness with which Frank greeted this proposal showed that for himthe story would have no lack of interest.""Let us sit down under this tree,"" said Henry Morton, pointing to ahorse-chestnut, whose dense foliage promised a pleasant shelter from thesun\'s rays.They threw themselves upon the grass, and he forthwith commenced hisstory.""My father was born in Boston, and, growing up, engaged in mercantilepursuits. He was moderately successful, and finally accumulated fiftythousand dollars. He would not have stopped there, for he was at thetime making money rapidly, but his health became precarious, and hisphysician required him absolutely to give up business. The seeds ofconsumption, which probably had been lurking for years in his system,had begun to show themselves unmistakably, and required immediateattention.""By the advice of his physician he sailed for the West India Islands,hoping that the climate might have a beneficial effect upon him. At thattime I was twelve years old, and an only child. My mother had died someyears before, so that I was left quite alone in the world. I was sentfor a time to Virginia, to my mother\'s brother, who possessed a largeplantation and numerous slaves. Here I remained for six months. You willremember that Aunt Chloe recognized me at first sight. You will not besurprised at this when I tell you that she was my uncle\'s slave, andthat as a boy I was indebted to her for many a little favor which she,being employed in the kitchen, was able to render me. As I told you atthe time, my real name is not Morton. It will not be long before youunderstand the reason of my concealment.""My father had a legal adviser, in whom he reposed a large measure ofconfidence, though events showed him to be quite unworthy of it. Onleaving Boston he divided his property, which had been converted intomoney, into two equal portions. One part he took with him. The otherhe committed to the lawyer\'s charge. So much confidence had he in thisman\'s honor, that he did not even require a receipt. One additionalsafeguard he had, however. This was the evidence of the lawyer\'s clerk,who was present on the occasion of the deposit.""My father went to the West Indies, but the change seemed only toaccelerate the progress of his malady. He lingered for a few months andthen died. Before his death he wrote two letters, one to my uncle andone to myself. In these he communicated the fact of his having depositedtwenty-five thousand dollars with his lawyer. He mentioned incidentallythe presence of the lawyer\'s clerk at the time. I am a little surprisedthat he should have done it, as not the faintest suspicion of thelawyer\'s good faith had entered his thoughts.""On receiving this letter my uncle, on my behalf, took measures to claimthis sum, and for this purpose came to Boston. Imagine his surprise andindignation when the lawyer positively denied having received any suchdeposit and called upon him, to prove it. With great effrontery hedeclared that it was absurd to suppose that my father would haveentrusted him with any such sum without a receipt for it. This certainlylooked plausible, and I acknowledge that few except my father, who nevertrusted without trusting entirely, would have acted so imprudently.""\'Where is the clerk who was in your office at the time?"" inquired myuncle.The lawyer looked somewhat discomposed at this question.""\'Why do you ask?\'he inquired abruptly.""\'Because,\' was the reply, \'his evidence is very important to us. Mybrother states that he was present when the deposit was made.\'""\'I don\'t know where he is,\' said the lawyer. \'He was too dissipated toremain in my office, and I accordingly discharged him.\'""My uncle suspected that the clerk had been bribed to keep silence, andfor additional security sent off to some distant place.""Nothing could be done. Strong as our suspicions, and absolute as wasour conviction of the lawyer\'s guilt, we had no recourse. But from thattime I devoted my life to the exposure of this man. Fortunately I wasnot without means. The other half of my father\'s property came to me;and the interest being considerably more than I required for my support,I have devoted the remainder to, prosecuting inquiries respecting themissing clerk. Just before I came to Rossville, I obtained a clue whichI have since industriously followed up.""Last night I received a letter from my agent, stating that he had foundthe man--that he was in a sad state of destitution, and that he wasready to give his evidence.""""Is the lawyer still living?"" inquired Frank.""He is.""""What a villain he must be.""""I am afraid he is, Frank.""""Does he still live in Boston?""""No. After he made sure of his ill-gotten gains, he removed into thecountry, where he built him a fine house. He has been able to live alife of leisure; but I doubt if he has been as happy as he would havebeen had he never deviated from the path of rectitude.""""Have you seen him lately?"" asked Frank.""I have seen him many times within the last few months,"" said the youngman, in a significant tone.Frank jumped to his feet in surprise. ""You don\'t mean----"" he said, as asudden suspicion of the truth dawned upon his mind.""Yes,"" said Mr. Morton deliberately, ""I do mean that the lawyer whodefrauded my father lives in this village. You know him well as SquireHaynes.""""I can hardly believe it,"" said Frank, unable to conceal hisastonishment. ""Do you think he knows who you are?""""I think he has noticed my resemblance to my father. If I had notassumed a different name he would have been sure to detect me. Thiswould have interfered with my plans, as he undoubtedly knew thewhereabouts of his old clerk, and would have arranged to remove him, soas to delay his discovery, perhaps indefinitely. Here is the letter Ireceived last night. I will read it to you.""The letter ran as follows:""I have at length discovered the man of whom I have so long been insearch. I found him in Detroit. He had recently removed thither from St.Louis. He is very poor, and, when I found him, was laid up with typhoidfever in a mean lodging-house. I removed him to more comfortablequarters, supplied him with relishing food and good medical assistance.Otherwise I think he would have died. The result is, that he feelsdeeply grateful to me for having probably saved his life. When I firstbroached the idea of his giving evidence against his old employer, Ifound him reluctant to do so--not from any attachment he bore him, butfrom a fear that he would be held on a criminal charge for concealing afelony. I have undertaken to assure him, on your behalf, that heshall not be punished if he will come forward and give his evidenceunhesitatingly. I have finally obtained his promise to, do so.""We shall leave Detroit day after to-morrow, and proceed to New Englandby way of New York. Can you meet me in New York on the 18th inst.? Youcan, in that case, have an interview with this man Travers; and it Willbe well to obtain his confession, legally certified, to guard againstany vacillation of purpose on his part. I have no apprehension of it,but it is as well to be certain.""This letter was signed by Mr. Morton\'s agent.""I was very glad to get that letter, Frank,"" said his companion. ""Idon\'t think I care so much for the money, though that is not to bedespised, since it will enable me to do more good than at present I haveit in my power to do. But there is one thing I care for still more, andthat is, to redeem my father\'s memory from reproach. In the last letterhe ever wrote he made a specific statement, which this lawyer declaresto be false. The evidence of his clerk will hurl back the falsehood uponhimself.""""How strange it is, Mr. Morton,"" exclaimed Frank, ""that you should havesaved the life of a son of the man who has done so much to injure you!""""Yes, that gives me great satisfaction. I do not wish Squire Haynes anyharm, but I am determined that justice shall be done. Otherwise thanthat, if I can be of any service to him, I shall not refuse.""""I remember now,"" said Frank, after a moment\'s pause, ""that, on thefirst Sunday you appeared at church, Squire Haynes stopped me to inquirewho you were.""""I am thought to look much as my father did. He undoubtedly saw theresemblance. I have often caught his eyes fixed upon me in perplexitywhen he did not know that I noticed him. It is fourteen years since myfather died. Retribution has been slow, but it has come at last.""""When do you go on to New York?"" asked Frank, recalling the agent\'srequest.""I shall start to-morrow morning. For the present I will ask you to keepwhat I have said a secret even from your good mother. It is as well notto disturb Squire Haynes in his fancied security until we are ready tooverwhelm him with our evidence.""""How long shall you be absent, Mr. Morton?""""Probably less than a week. I shall merely say that I have gone onbusiness. I trust to your discretion to say nothing more.""""I certainly will not,"" said Frank. ""I am very much obliged to you forhaving told me first.""The two rose from their grassy seats, and walked slowly back to thefarmhouse.']"
86,32,Chapter 32,"['XXX. FRANK CALLS ON SQUIRE HAYNESThe next morning Mr. Morton was a passenger by the early stage forWebbington, where he took the train for Boston. Thence he was to proceedto New York by the steamboat train.""Good-by, Mr. Morton,"" said Frank, waving his cap as the stage started.""I hope you\'ll soon be back.""""I hope so, too; good-by.""Crack went the whip, round went the wheels. The horses started, and thestage rumbled off, swaying this way and that, as if top-heavy.Frank went slowly back to the house, feeling quite lonely. He had becomeso accustomed to Mr. Morton\'s companionship that his departure left avoid which he hardly knew how to fill.As he reflected upon Mr. Morton\'s story he began to feel an increaseduneasiness at the mortgage held by Squire Haynes upon his father\'s farm.The time was very near at hand--only ten days off--when the mortgagemight be foreclosed, and but half the money was in readiness.Perhaps, however, Squire Haynes had no intention of foreclosing. If so,there was no occasion for apprehension. But about this he felt by nomeans certain.He finally determined, without consulting his mother, to make the squirea visit and inquire frankly what he intended to do. The squire\'s answerwould regulate his future proceedings.It was Frank\'s rule--and a very good one, too--to do at once whateverneeded to be done. He resolved to lose no time in making his call.""Frank,"" said his mother, as he entered the house, ""I want you to godown to the store some time this forenoon, and get me half a dozenpounds of sugar.""""Very well, mother, I\'ll go now. I suppose it won\'t make any differenceif I don\'t come back for an hour or two.""""No, that will be in time.""Mrs. Frost did not ask Frank where he was going. She had perfect faithin him, and felt sure that he would never become involved in anythingdiscreditable.Frank passed through the village without stopping at the store. Hedeferred his mother\'s errand until his return. Passing up the villagestreet, he stopped before the fine house of Squire Haynes. Opening thegate he walked up the graveled path and rang the bell.A servant-girl came to the door.""Is Squire Haynes at home?"" inquired Frank.""Yes, but he\'s eating breakfast.""""Will he be through soon?""""Shure and I think so.""""Then I will step in and wait for him.""""Who shall I say it is?""""Frank Frost.""Squire Haynes had just passed his cup for coffee when Bridget enteredand reported that Frank Frost was in the drawing-room and would like tosee him when he had finished his breakfast.""Frank Frost!"" repeated the squire, arching his eyebrows. ""What does hewant, I wonder?""""Shure he didn\'t say,"" said Bridget.""Very well.""""He is captain of the boys\' company, John, isn\'t he?"" asked the squire.""Yes,"" said John sulkily. ""I wish him joy of his office. I wouldn\'t haveanything to do with such a crowd of ragamuffins.""Of course the reader understands that this was ""sour grapes"" on John\'spart.Finishing his breakfast leisurely, Squire Haynes went into the roomwhere Frank was sitting patiently awaiting him.Frank rose as he entered.""Good morning, Squire Haynes,"" he said, politely rising as he spoke.""Good morning,"" said the squire coldly. ""You are an early visitor.""If this was intended for a rebuff, Frank did not choose to take anynotice of it.""I call on a little matter of business, Squire Haynes,"" continued Frank.""Very well,"" said the squire, seating himself in a luxurious armchair,""I am ready to attend to you.""""I believe you hold a mortgage on our farm.""Squire Haynes started. The thought of Frank\'s real business had notoccurred to him. He had hoped that nothing would have been said inrelation to the mortgage until he was at liberty to foreclose, as hewished to take the Frosts unprepared. He now resolved, if possible, tokeep Frank in ignorance of his real purpose, that he might not think itnecessary to prepare for his attack.""Yes,"" said he indifferently; ""I hold quite a number of mortgages, andone upon your father\'s farm among them.""""Isn\'t the time nearly run out?"" asked Frank anxiously.""I can look if you desire it,"" said the squire, in the same indifferenttone.""I should be glad if you would.""""May I ask why you are desirous of ascertaining the precise date?"" askedthe squire. ""Are you intending to pay off the mortgage?""""No, sir,"" said Frank. ""We are not prepared to do so at present.""Squire Haynes felt relieved. He feared for a moment that Mr. Frost hadsecured the necessary sum, and that he would be defeated in his wickedpurpose.He drew out a large number of papers, which he rather ostentatiouslyscattered about the table, and finally came to the mortgage.""The mortgage comes due on the first of July,"" he said.""Will it be convenient for you to renew it, Squire Haynes?"" asked Frankanxiously. ""Father being absent, it would be inconvenient for us toobtain the amount necessary to cancel it. Of course, I shall be ready topay the interest promptly.""""Unless I should have sudden occasion for the money,"" said the squire,""I will let it remain. I don\'t think you need feel any anxiety on thesubject.""With the intention of putting Frank off his guard, Squire Haynes assumeda comparatively gracious tone. This, in the case of any other man, wouldhave completely reassured Frank. But he had a strong distrust of thesquire, since the revelation of his character made by his friend Mr.Morton.""Could you tell me positively?"" he asked, still uneasy. ""It is only tendays now to the first of July, and that is little enough to raise themoney in.""""Don\'t trouble yourself,"" said the squire. ""I said unless I had suddenoccasion for the money, because unforeseen circumstances might arise.But as I have a considerable sum lying at the bank, I don\'t anticipateanything of the kind.""""I suppose you will give me immediate notice, should it be necessary.We can pay four hundred dollars now. So, if you please, the new mortgagecan be made out for half the present amount.""""Very well,"" said the squire carelessly. ""Just as you please as to that.Still, as you have always paid my interest regularly, I consider theinvestment a good one, and have no objection to the whole remaining.""""Thank you, sir,"" said Frank, rising to go.Frank took his hat, and, bowing to the squire, sought the front door.His face wore a perplexed expression. He hardly knew what to think aboutthe interview he had just had.""Squire Haynes talks fair enough,"" he soliloquized; ""and, perhaps, hemeans what he says. If it hadn\'t been for what Mr. Morton told me, Ishould have confidence in him. But a man who will betray a trust iscapable of breaking his word to me. I think I\'ll look round a little,and see if I can\'t provide for the worse in case it comes.""Just after Frank left the house, John entered his father\'s presence.""What did Frank Frost want of you, father?"" he asked.""He came about the mortgage.""""Did he want to pay it?""""No, he wants me to renew it.""""Of course you refused.""""Of course I did no such thing. Do you think I am a fool?""""You don\'t mean to say that you agreed to renew it?"" demanded John, inangry amazement.Squire Haynes rather enjoyed John\'s mystification.""Come,"" said he, ""I\'m afraid you\'ll never make a lawyer if you\'re notsharper than that comes to. Never reveal your plans to your adversary.That\'s an important principle. If I had refused, he would have goneto work, and in ten days between now and the first of July, he\'d havemanaged in some way to scrape together the eight hundred dollars. He\'sgot half of it now.""""What did you tell him, then?""""I put him off by telling him not to trouble himself--that I would notforeclose the mortgage unless I had unexpected occasion for the money.""""Yes, I see,"" said John, his face brightening at the anticipateddisaster to the Frosts. ""You\'ll take care that there shall be somesudden occasion.""""Yes,"" said the squire complacently. ""I\'ll have a note come due, which Ihad not thought about, or something of the kind.""""Oh, that\'ll be bully.""""Don\'t use such low words, John. I have repeatedly requested you tobe more careful about your language. By the way, your teacher told meyesterday that you are not doing as well now as formerly.""""Oh, he\'s an old muff. Besides, he\'s got a spite against me. I should doa good deal better at another school.""""We\'ll see about that. But I suspect he\'s partly right.""""Well, how can a feller study when he knows the teacher is determined tobe down upon him?""""\'Feller!\' I am shocked at hearing you use that word. \'Down upon him,\'too!""""Very well; let me go where I won\'t hear such language spoken.""It would have been well if Squire Haynes had been as much shocked by badactions as by low language.This little disagreement over, they began again to anticipate withpleasure the effect of the squire\'s premeditated blow upon the Frosts.""We\'ll come up with \'em?"" said John, with inward exultation.Meanwhile, though the squire was entirely unconscious of it, there was asword hanging over his own head.']"
86,33,Chapter 33,"['XXXI. SQUIRE HAYNES SPRINGS HIS TRAPAs intimated in the last chapter, Frank determined to see if he couldnot raise the money necessary to pay off the mortgage in case it shouldbe necessary to do so.Farmer Maynard was a man in very good circumstances. He owned anexcellent farm, which yielded more than enough to support his family.Probably he had one or two thousand dollars laid aside.""I think he will help me,"" Frank said to himself, ""I\'ll go to him.""He went to the house, and was directed to the barn. There he foundthe farmer engaged in mending a hoe-handle, which had been broken, bysplicing it.He unfolded his business. The farmer listened attentively to hisstatement.""You say the squire as much as told you that he would renew themortgage?""""Yes.""""Well, I wouldn\'t trouble myself then; I\'ve no doubt he\'ll do it.""""He said, unless he should have some sudden occasion for the money.""""All right. He is a prudent man, and don\'t want to bind himself. That isall. You know the most unlikely things may happen; but I don\'t believethe squire\'ll want the money. He\'s got plenty in the bank.""""But if he should?""""Then he\'ll wait, or take part. I suppose you can pay part.""""Yes, half.""""Then I guess there won\'t be any chance of anything going wrong.""""If there should,"" persisted Frank, ""could you lend us four hundreddollars to make up the amount?""""I\'d do it in a minute, Frank, but I hain\'t got the money by me. Whatmoney I have got besides the farm is lent out in notes. Only last weekI let my brother-in-law have five hundred dollars, and that leaves mepretty short.""""Perhaps somebody else will advance the money,"" said Frank, feeling alittle discouraged at the result of his first application.""Yes, most likely. But I guess you won\'t need any assistance. I lookupon it as certain that the mortgage will be renewed. Next fall I shallhave the money, and if the squire wants to dispose of the mortgage, Ishall be ready to take it off his hands.""Frank tried to feel that he was foolish in apprehending trouble fromSquire Haynes, but he found it impossible to rid himself of a vaguefeeling of uneasiness.He made application to another farmer--an intimate friend of hisfather\'s--but he had just purchased and paid for a five-acre lotadjoining his farm, and that had stripped him of money. He, too,bade Frank lay aside all anxiety, and assured him that his fears weregroundless.With this Frank had to be content.""Perhaps I am foolish,"" he said to himself. ""I\'ll try to think no moreabout it.""He accordingly returned to his usual work, and, not wishing to troublehis mother to no purpose, resolved not to impart his fears to her.Another ground of relief suggested itself to him. Mr. Morton wouldprobably be back on the 27th of June. Such, at least, was hisanticipation when he went away. There was reason to believe that hewould be both ready and willing to take up the mortgage, if needful.This thought brought back Frank\'s cheerfulness.It was somewhat dashed by the following letter which he received a dayor two later from his absent friend. It was dated New York, June 25,1863. As will appear from its tenor, it prepared Frank for a furtherdelay in Mr. Morton\'s arrival.""DEAR FRANK: I shall not be with you quite as soon as I intended. Ihope, however, to return a day or two afterward at latest. My businessis going on well, and I am assured of final success. Will you ask yourmother if she can accommodate an acquaintance of mine for a day or two?I shall bring him with me from New York, and shall feel indebted for theaccommodation.""Your true friend,""HENRY MORTON.""Frank understood at once that the acquaintance referred to must bethe clerk, whose evidence was so important to Mr. Morton\'s case. Beingenjoined to secrecy, however, he, of course, felt that he was not atliberty to mention this.One day succeeded another until at length the morning of the thirtiethof June dawned. Mr. Morton had not yet arrived; but, on the other hand,nothing had been heard from Squire Haynes.Frank began to breathe more freely. He persuaded himself that he hadbeen foolishly apprehensive. ""The squire means to renew the mortgage,""he said to himself hopefully.He had a talk with his mother, and she agreed that it would be well topay the four hundred dollars they could spare, and have a new mortgagemade out for the balance. Frank accordingly rode over to Brandon in theforenoon, and withdrew from the bank the entire sum there deposited tohis father\'s credit. This, with money which had been received from Mr.Morton in payment of his board, made up the requisite amount.About four o\'clock in the afternoon, as Mrs. Frost was sewing at a frontwindow, she exclaimed to Frank, who was making a kite for his littlebrother Charlie, ""Frank, there\'s Squire Haynes coming up the road.""Frank\'s heart gave an anxious bound.""Is he coming here?"" he asked, with anxiety.""Yes,"" said Mrs. Frost, after a moment\'s pause. Frank turned pale withapprehension.A moment afterward the huge knocker was heard to sound, and Mrs. Frost,putting down her work, smoothed her apron and went to the door.""Good afternoon, Mrs. Frost,"" said the squire, lifting his hat.""Good afternoon, Squire Haynes. Won\'t you walk in?""""Thank you; I will intrude for a few minutes. How do you do?"" he said,nodding to Frank as he entered.""Pretty well, thank you, sir,"" said Frank nervously.The squire, knowing the odium which would attach to the course he hadsettled upon, resolved to show the utmost politeness to the family hewas about to injure, and justify his action by the plea of necessity.""Take a seat, Squire Haynes,"" said Mrs. Frost ""You\'ll find thisrocking-chair more comfortable.\'""I am very well seated, thank you. I cannot stop long. I have merelycalled on a matter of business.""""About the mortgage?"" interrupted Frank, who could keep silence nolonger.""Precisely so. I regret to say that I have urgent occasion for themoney, and shall be unable to renew it.""""We have got four hundred dollars,"" said Mrs. Frost, ""which we areintending to pay.""""I am sorry to say that this will not answer my purpose.""""Why did you not let us know before?"" asked Frank abruptly.""Frank!"" said his mother reprovingly.""It was only this morning that the necessity arose. I have a note duewhich must be paid.""""We are not provided with the money, Squire Haynes,"" said Mrs. Frost.""if, however, you will wait a few days, we can probably raise it amongour friends.""""I regret to say that this will not do,"" said the squire, ""I wouldgladly postpone the matter. The investment has been satisfactory to me,but necessity knows no law.""Frank was about to burst out with some indignant exclamation, but hismother, checking him, said: ""I think there is little chance of our beingable to pay you to-morrow. May I inquire what course you propose totake?""""It will be my painful duty to foreclose the mortgage.""""Squire Haynes,"" said Frank boldly, ""haven\'t you intended to foreclosethe mortgage all along? Hadn\'t you decided about it when I called uponyou ten days ago?""""What do you mean by your impertinence, sir?"" demanded the squire,giving vent to his anger.""Just what I say. I believe you bear a grudge against my father, andonly put me off the other day in order to prevent my being able tomeet your demands to-morrow. What do you suppose we can do in less thantwenty-four hours?""""Madam!"" said the squire, purple with rage, ""do you permit your son toinsult me in this manner?""""I leave it to your conscience, Squire Haynes, whether his charges arenot deserved. I do not like to think ill of any man, but your course isvery suspicious.""""Madam,"" said Squire Haynes, now thoroughly enraged, ""you are a woman,and can say what you please; but as for this young rascal, I\'ll beat himwithin an inch of his life if I ever catch him out of your presence.""""He is under the protection of the laws,"" said Mrs. Frost composedly,""which you, being a lawyer, ought to understand.""""I\'ll have no mercy on you. I\'ll sell you up root and branch,"" saidSquire Haynes, trembling with passion, and smiting the floor with hiscane.""At all events the house is ours to-day,"" returned Mrs. Frost, withdignity, ""and I must request you to leave us in quiet possession of it.""The squire left the house in undignified haste, muttering threats as hewent.""Good, mother!"" exclaimed Frank admiringly. ""You turned him outcapitally. But,"" he added, an expression of dismay stealing over hisface, ""what shall we do?""""We must try to obtain a loan,"" said Mrs. Frost, ""I will go and see Mr.Sanger, while you go to Mr. Perry. Possibly they may help us. There isno time to be lost.""An hour afterward Frank and his mother returned, both disappointed.Mr. Sanger and Mr. Perry both had the will to help but not the ability.There seemed no hope left save in Mr. Morton. At six o\'clock the stagerolled up to the gate.""Thank Heaven! Mr. Morton has come!"" exclaimed Frank eagerly.Mr. Morton got out of the stage, and with him a feeble old man, orsuch he seemed, whom the young man assisted to alight. They came up thegravel walk together.""How do you do, Frank?"" he said, with a cheerful smile.""We are in trouble,"" said Frank. ""Squire Haynes is going to foreclosethe mortgage to-morrow.""""Never mind!"" said Mr. Morton. ""We will be ready for him. He can\'t doeither of us any more mischief, Frank. His race is about run.""A heavy weight seemed lifted from Frank\'s heart. For the rest of the dayhe was in wild spirits. He asked no questions of Mr. Morton. He felt afirm confidence that all would turn out for the best.']"
86,34,Chapter 34,"['XXXII. TURNING THE TABLESThe next morning Mr. Morton made inquiries of Frank respecting themortgage. Frank explained that a loan of four hundred dollars wouldenable him to cancel it.""That is very easily arranged, then,"" said Henry Morton.He opened his pocketbook and drew out four crisp new United Statesnotes, of one hundred dollars each.""There, Frank,"" said he; ""that will loosen the hold Squire Haynes hasupon you. I fancy he will find it a little more difficult to extricatehimself from my grasp.""""How can I ever thank you, Mr. Morton?"" said Frank, with emotion.""It gives me great pleasure to have it in my power to be of service toyou, Frank,"" said his friend kindly.""We will have a mortgage made out to you,"" continued Frank.""Not without my consent, I hope,"" said Mr. Morton, smiling.Frank looked puzzled.""No, Frank,"" resumed Mr. Morton, ""I don\'t care for any security. You maygive me a simple acknowledgment of indebtedness, and then pay me at yourleisure.""Frank felt with Justice that Mr. Morton was acting very generously, andhe was more than ever drawn to him.So passed the earlier hours of the forenoon.About eleven o\'clock Squire Haynes was observed approaching the house.His step was firm and elastic, as if he rejoiced in the errand he wasupon. Again he lifted the knocker, and sounded a noisy summons. It wasin reality a summons to surrender.The door was opened again by Mrs. Frost, who invited the squire toenter. He did so, wondering at her apparent composure.""They can\'t have raised the money,"" thought he apprehensively. ""No, I amsure the notice was too short.""Frank was in the room, but Squire Haynes did not deign to notice him,nor did Frank choose to make advances. Mrs. Frost spoke upon indifferentsubjects, being determined to force Squire Haynes to broach himself thebusiness that had brought him to the farm.Finally, clearing his throat, he said: ""Well, madam, are you prepared tocancel the mortgage which I hold upon your husband\'s farm?""""I hope,"" said Mrs. Frost, ""you will give us time. It is hardly possibleto obtain so large a sum in twenty-four hours.""""They haven\'t got it,"" thought the squire exultingly.""As to that,"" he said aloud, ""you\'ve had several years to get ready in.""""Have you no consideration? Remember my husband\'s absence, and I amunacquainted with business.""""I have already told you,"" said the squire hastily, ""that I require themoney. I have a note to pay, and----""""Can you give us a week?""""No, I must have the money at once.""""And if we cannot pay?""""I must foreclose.""""Will that give you the money any sooner? I suppose you would have toadvertise the farm for sale before you could realize anything, and Ihardly think that car be accomplished sooner than a week hence.""""The delay is only a subterfuge on your part,"" said the squire hotly.""You would be no better prepared at the end of a week than you are now.""""No, perhaps not,"" said Mrs. Frost quietly.""And yet you ask me to wait,"" said the squire indignantly. ""Once forall, let me tell you that all entreaties are vain. My mind is made up toforeclose, and foreclose I will.""""Don\'t be too sure of that,"" interrupted Frank, with a triumphant smile.""Ha, young impudence!"" exclaimed the squire, wheeling round. ""Who\'s toprevent me, I should like to know?""""I am,"" said Frank boldly.The squire fingered his cane nervously. He was very strongly tempted tolay it on our hero\'s back. But he reflected that the power was in hishands, and that he was sure of his revenge.""You won\'t gain anything by your impudence,"" he said loftily. ""I mighthave got you a place, out of pity to your mother, if you had behaveddifferently. I need a boy to do odd jobs about the house, and I mighthave offered the place to you.""""Thank you for your kind intentions,"" said Frank, ""but I fear the careof this farm will prevent my accepting your tempting offer.""""The care of the farm!"" repeated the squire angrily. ""Do you think Iwill delegate it to you?""""I don\'t see what you have to do about it,"" said Frank.""Then you\'ll find out,"" roared the squire. ""I shall take immediatepossession, and require you to leave at once.""""Then I suppose we had better pay the mortgage, mother,"" said Frank.""Pay the mortgage! You can\'t do it,"" said the squire exultingly.""Have you the document with you?"" inquired Mrs. Frost.""Yes, madam.""""Name the amount due on it.""""With interest eight hundred and twenty-four dollars.""""Frank, call in Mr. Morton as a witness.""Mr. Morton entered.""Now, Frank, you may count out the money.""""What!"" stammered the squire, in dismay, ""can you pay it.""""We can.""""Why didn\'t you tell me so in the first place?"" demanded Squire Haynes,his wrath excited by his bitter disappointment.""I wished to ascertain whether your course was dictated by necessity ora desire to annoy and injure us. I can have no further doubt about it.""There was no help for it. Squire Haynes was compelled to release hishold upon the Frost Farm, and pocket his money. He had never been sosorry to receive money before.This business over, he was about to beat a hurried retreat, when he wassuddenly arrested by a question from Henry Morton.""Can you spare me a few minutes, Squire Haynes?""""I am in haste, sir.""""My business is important, and has already been too long delayed.""""Too long delayed?""""Yes, it has waited twelve years.""""I don\'t understand you, sir,"" said the squire.""Perhaps I can assist you. You know me as Henry Morton. That is not myreal name.""""An alias!"" sneered the squire in a significant tone.""Yes, I had my reasons,"" returned the young man, unmoved.""I have no doubt of it.""Henry Morton smiled, but did not otherwise notice the unpleasantimputation.""My real name is Richard Waring.""Squire Haynes started violently and scrutinized the young man closelythrough his spectacles. His vague suspicions were confirmed.""Do you wish to know my business with you?""The squire muttered something inaudible.""I demand the restitution of the large sum of money entrusted to you bymy father, just before his departure to the West Indies--a sum of whichyou have been the wrongful possessor for twelve years.""""Do you mean to insult me?"" exclaimed the squire, bold in the assurancethat the sole evidence of his fraud was undiscovered.""Unless you comply with my demand I shall proceed against you legally,and you are enough of a lawyer to understand the punishment meted out tothat description of felony.""""Pooh, pooh! Your threats won\'t avail you,"" said the squirecontemptuously. ""Your plan is a very clumsy one. Let me suggest toyou, young man, that threats for the purpose of extorting money areactionable.""""Do you doubt my identity?""""You may very probably be the person you claim to be, but that won\'tsave you.""""Very well. You have conceded one point.""He walked quietly to the door of the adjoining room, opened it, and in adistinct voice called ""James Travers.""At the sound of this name Squire Haynes sank into a chair, ashy pale.A man, not over forty, but with seamed face, hair nearly white, and aform evidently broken with ill health, slowly entered.Squire Haynes beheld him with dismay.""You see before you, Squire Haynes, a man whose silence has been yoursafeguard for the last twelve years. His lips are now unsealed. JamesTravers, tell us what you know of the trust reposed in this man by myfather.""""No, no,"" said the squire hurriedly. ""It--it is enough. I will makerestitution.""""You have done wisely,"" said Richard Waring. (We must give him his truename.) ""When will you be ready to meet me upon this business?""""To-morrow,"" muttered the squire.He left the house with the air of one who has been crushed by a suddenblow.The pride of the haughty had been laid low, and retribution, longdeferred, had come at last.Numerous and hearty were the congratulations which Mr. Morton--I meanMr. Waring--received upon his new accession of property.""I do not care so much for that,"" he said, ""but my father\'s word hasbeen vindicated. My mind is now at peace.""There was more than one happy heart at the farm that night. Mr. Waringhad accomplished the great object of his life; and as for Frank and hismother, they felt that the black cloud which had menaced their happinesshad been removed, and henceforth there seemed prosperous days in store.To cap the climax of their happiness, the afternoon mail brought aletter from Mr. Frost, in which he imparted the intelligence that he hadbeen promoted to a second lieutenancy.""Mother,"" said Frank, ""you must be very dignified now, You are anofficer\'s wife.""']"
86,35,Chapter 35,"['XXXIII. CONCLUSIONThe restitution which Squire Haynes was compelled to make stripped himof more than half his property. His mortification and chagrin was sogreat that he determined to remove from Rossville. He gave no intimationwhere he was going, but it is understood that he is now living in thevicinity of Philadelphia, in a much more modest way than at Rossville.To anticipate matters a little, it may be said that John was recentlyexamined for college, but failed so signally that he will not again makethe attempt. He has shown a disposition to be extravagant, which, unlesscurbed, will help him run through his father\'s diminished property at arapid rate whenever it shall come into his possession.The squire\'s handsome house in Rossville was purchased by HenryMorton--I must still be allowed to call him thus, though not his realname. He has not yet taken up his residence there, but there is reasonto believe that ere long there will be a Mrs. Morton to keep him companytherein.Not long since, as he and Frank lay stretched out beneath athick-branching oak in the front yard at the farm, Mr. Morton turned toour hero and said, ""Are you meaning to go to college when your fathercomes home, Frank?""Frank hesitated.""I have always looked forward to it,"" he said, ""but lately I have beenthinking that I shall have to give up the idea.""""Why so?""""Because it is so expensive that my father cannot, in justice to hisother children, support me through a four years\' course. Besides, youknow, Mr. Morton, we are four hundred dollars in your debt.""""Should you like very much to go to college, Frank?""""Better than anything else in the world.""""Then you shall go.""Frank looked up in surprise.""Don\'t you understand me?"" said Mr. Morton.""I mean that I will defray your expenses through college.""Frank could hardly believe his ears.""You would spend so much money on me!"" he exclaimed incredulously. ""Why,it will cost a thousand dollars.""""Very well, I can afford it,"" said Mr. Morton. ""But perhaps you objectto the plan.""""How good you are to me!"" said Frank, impulsively seizing his friend\'shand. ""What have I done to deserve so much kindness?""""You have done your duty, Frank, at the sacrifice of your inclinations.I think you ought to be rewarded. God has bestowed upon me more than Ineed. I think he intends that I shall become his almoner. If youdesire to express your gratitude, you can best do it by improving theadvantages which will be opened to you.""Frank hastened to his mother to communicate his brilliant prospects. Herjoy was scarcely less than his.""Do not forget, Frank,"" she said, ""who it is that has raised up thisfriend for you. Give Him the thanks.""There was another whose heart was gladdened when this welcome newsreached him in his tent beside the Rappahannock. He felt that whilehe was doing his duty in the field, God was taking better care of hisfamily than he could have done if he remained at home.Before closing this chronicle I must satisfy the curiosity of my readersupon a few points in which they may feel interested.The Rossville Guards are still in existence, and Frank is still theircaptain. They have already done escort duty on several occasions, andonce they visited Boston, and marched up State Street with a precisionof step which would have done no discredit to veteran soldiers.Dick Bumstead\'s reformation proved to be a permanent one. He is Frank\'smost intimate friend, and with his assistance is laboring to remedy thedefects of his early education. He has plenty of ability, and, now thathe has turned over a new leaf, I have no hesitation in predicting forhim a useful and honorable career.Old Mrs. Payson has left Rossville, much to the delight of her grandsonSam, who never could get along with his grandmother. She still wears forbest the ""bunnit"" presented her by Cynthy Ann, which, notwithstandingits mishap, seems likely to last her to the end of her natural life. Shestill has a weakness for hot gingerbread and mince pie, and, thoughshe is turned of seventy, would walk a mile any afternoon with such aninducement.Should any of my readers at any time visit the small town of Sparta, andencounter in the street a little old lady dressed in a brown cloakand hood, and firmly grasping in her right hand a faded blue cottonumbrella, they may feel quite certain that they are in the presence ofMrs. Mehitabel Payson, relict of Jeremiah Payson, deceased.Little Pomp has improved very much both in his studies and his behavior.He now attends school regularly, and is quite as far advanced as mostboys of his age. Though he is not entirely cured of his mischievouspropensities, he behaves ""pretty well, considering,"" and is a great dealof company to old Chloe, to whom he reads stories in books lent him byFrank and others. Chloe is amazingly proud of Pomp, whom she regards asa perfect prodigy of talent.""Lor\' bress you, missus,"" she remarked to Mrs. Frost one day, ""he readsjest as fast as I can talk. He\'s an awful smart boy, dat Pomp.""""Why don\'t you let him teach you to read, Chloe?""""Oh, Lor\', missus, I couldn\'t learn, nohow. I ain\'t got no gumption. Idon\'t know noffin\'.""""Why couldn\'t you learn as well as Pomp?""""Dat ar boy\'s a gen\'us, missus. His fader was a mighty smart nigger, andPomp\'s took arter him.""Chloe\'s conviction of her own inferiority and Pomp\'s superior abilityseemed so rooted that Mrs. Frost finally gave up her persuasions.Meanwhile, as Chloe is in good health and has abundance of work, she hasno difficulty in earning a comfortable subsistence for herself and Pomp.As soon as Pomp is old enough, Frank will employ him upon the farm.While I am writing these lines intelligence has just been received fromFrank\'s substitute at the seat of war. He has just been promoted to acaptaincy. In communicating this he adds: ""You may tell Frank that I amnow his equal in rank, though his commission bears an earlier date. Isuppose, therefore, I must content myself with being Captain Frost, Jr.I shall be very glad when the necessities of the country will permit meto lay aside the insignia of rank and, returning to Rossville, subsideinto plain Henry Frost again. If you ask me when this is to be, I canonly say that it depends on the length of our struggle. I am enlistedfor the war, and I mean to see it through! Till that time Frank mustcontent himself with acting as my substitute at home. I am so wellpleased with his management of the farm that I am convinced it is doingas well as if I were at home to superintend it in person. Express to Mr.Waring my gratitude for the generous proposal he has made to Frank. Ifeel that words are inadequate to express the extent of our obligationsto him.""Some years have passed since the above letter was written. The war ishappily over, and Captain Frost has returned home with an honorablerecord of service. Released from duty at home, Frank has exchanged thefarm for the college hall, and he is now approaching graduation, oneof the foremost scholars in his class. He bids fair to carry out thepromise of his boyhood, and in the more varied and prolonged campaignwhich manhood opens before him we have reason to believe that he willdisplay equal fidelity and gain an equal success.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Frank\'s Campaign, by Horatio Alger, Jr. END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANK\'S CAMPAIGN ** This file should be named 1573.txt or 1573.zip **This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/7/1573/Produced by Charles Keller and the Clift familyUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.
