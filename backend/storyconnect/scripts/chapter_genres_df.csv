84,The Last Days of Pompeii,1,"['Produced by John T. Horner and David WidgerTHE LAST DAYS OF POMPEIIby Edward George Bulwer-LyttonBOOK THE FIRSTChapter I.THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF POMPEII.\'HO, Diomed, well met!  Do you sup with Glaucus to-night?\' said a youngman of small stature, who wore his tunic in those loose and effeminatefolds which proved him to be a gentleman and a coxcomb.\'Alas, no! dear Clodius; he has not invited me,\' replied Diomed, a manof portly frame and of middle age.  \'By Pollux, a scurvy trick! for theysay his suppers are the best in Pompeii\'.\'Pretty well--though there is never enough of wine for me.  It is notthe old Greek blood that flows in his veins, for he pretends that winemakes him dull the next morning.\'\'There may be another reason for that thrift,\' said Diomed, raising hisbrows.  \'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, Ifancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphoraebetter than his wit.\'\'An additional reason for supping with him while the sesterces last.Next year, Diomed, we must find another Glaucus.\'\'He is fond of the dice, too, I hear.\'\'He is fond of every pleasure; and while he likes the pleasure of givingsuppers, we are all fond of him.\'\'Ha, ha, Clodius, that is well said!  Have you ever seen my wine-cellars,by-the-by?\'\'I think not, my good Diomed.\'\'Well, you must sup with me some evening; I have tolerable muraenae inmy reservoir, and I ask Pansa the aedile to meet you.\'\'O, no state with me!--Persicos odi apparatus, I am easily contented.Well, the day wanes; I am for the baths--and you...\'\'To the quaestor--business of state--afterwards to the temple of Isis.Vale!\'\'An ostentatious, bustling, ill-bred fellow,\' muttered Clodius tohimself, as he sauntered slowly away.  \'He thinks with his feasts andhis wine-cellars to make us forget that he is the son of a freedman--andso we will, when we do him the honour of winning his money; these richplebeians are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles.\'Thus soliloquising, Clodius arrived in the Via Domitiana, which wascrowded with passengers and chariots, and exhibited all that gay andanimated exuberance of life and motion which we find at this day in thestreets of Naples.The bells of the cars as they rapidly glided by each other jingledmerrily on the ear, and Clodius with smiles or nods claimed familiaracquaintance with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic: infact, no idler was better known in Pompeii.\'What, Clodius! and how have you slept on your good fortune?\' cried, ina pleasant and musical voice, a young man, in a chariot of the mostfastidious and graceful fashion.  Upon its surface of bronze wereelaborately wrought, in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece,reliefs of the Olympian games; the two horses that drew the car were ofthe rarest breed of Parthia; their slender limbs seemed to disdain theground and court the air, and yet at the slightest touch of thecharioteer, who stood behind the young owner of the equipage, theypaused motionless, as if suddenly transformed into stone--lifeless, butlifelike, as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles. The ownerhimself was of that slender and beautiful symmetry from which thesculptors of Athens drew their models; his Grecian origin betrayeditself in his light but clustering locks, and the perfect harmony of hisfeatures.  He wore no toga, which in the time of the emperors had indeedceased to be the general distinction of the Romans, and was especiallyridiculed by the pretenders to fashion; but his tunic glowed in therichest hues of the Tyrian dye, and the fibulae, or buckles, by which itwas fastened, sparkled with emeralds: around his neck was a chain ofgold, which in the middle of his breast twisted itself into the form ofa serpent\'s head, from the mouth of which hung pendent a large signetring of elaborate and most exquisite workmanship; the sleeves of thetunic were loose, and fringed at the hand with gold: and across thewaist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs, and of the same material asthe fringe, served in lieu of pockets for the receptacle of thehandkerchief and the purse, the stilus and the tablets.\'My dear Glaucus!\' said Clodius, \'I rejoice to see that your losses haveso little affected your mien.  Why, you seem as if you had been inspiredby Apollo, and your face shines with happiness like a glory; any onemight take you for the winner, and me for the loser.\'\'And what is there in the loss or gain of those dull pieces of metalthat should change our spirit, my Clodius?  By Venus, while yet young,we can cover our full locks with chaplets--while yet the cithara soundson unsated ears--while yet the smile of Lydia or of Chloe flashes overour veins in which the blood runs so swiftly, so long shall we finddelight in the sunny air, and make bald time itself but the treasurer ofour joys.  You sup with me to-night, you know.\'\'Who ever forgets the invitation of Glaucus!\'\'But which way go you now?\'\'Why, I thought of visiting the baths: but it wants yet an hour to theusual time.\'\'Well, I will dismiss my chariot, and go with you.  So, so, my Phylias,\'stroking the horse nearest to him, which by a low neigh and withbackward ears playfully acknowledged the courtesy: \'a holiday for youto-day.  Is he not handsome, Clodius?\'\'Worthy of Phoebus,\' returned the noble parasite--\'or of Glaucus.\'Chapter IITHE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL, AND THE BEAUTY OF FASHION.  THE ATHENIAN\'SCONFESSION.  THE READER\'S INTRODUCTION TO ARBACES OF EGYPT.TALKING lightly on a thousand matters, the two young men saunteredthrough the streets; they were now in that quarter which was filled withthe gayest shops, their open interiors all and each radiant with thegaudy yet harmonious colors of frescoes, inconceivably varied in fancyand design. The sparkling fountains, that at every vista threw upwardstheir grateful spray in the summer air; the crowd of passengers, orrather loiterers, mostly clad in robes of the Tyrian dye; the gay groupscollected round each more attractive shop; the slaves passing to and frowith buckets of bronze, cast in the most graceful shapes, and borne upontheir heads; the country girls stationed at frequent intervals withbaskets of blushing fruit, and flowers more alluring to the ancientItalians than to their descendants (with whom, indeed, ""latet anguis inherba,"" a disease seems lurking in every violet and rose); the numeroushaunts which fulfilled with that idle people the office of cafes andclubs at this day; the shops, where on shelves of marble were ranged thevases of wine and oil, and before whose thresholds, seats, protectedfrom the sun by a purple awning, invited the weary to rest and theindolent to lounge--made a scene of such glowing and vivaciousexcitement, as might well give the Athenian spirit of Glaucus an excusefor its susceptibility to joy.\'Talk to me no more of Rome,\' said he to Clodius.  \'Pleasure is toostately and ponderous in those mighty walls: even in the precincts ofthe court--even in the Golden House of Nero, and the incipient gloriesof the palace of Titus, there is a certain dulness of magnificence--theeye aches--the spirit is wearied; besides, my Clodius, we arediscontented when we compare the enormous luxury and wealth of otherswith the mediocrity of our own state.  But here we surrender ourselveseasily to pleasure, and we have the brilliancy of luxury without thelassitude of its pomp.\'\'It was from that feeling that you chose your summer retreat atPompeii?\'\'It was.  I prefer it to Baiae: I grant the charms of the latter, but Ilove not the pedants who resort there, and who seem to weigh out theirpleasures by the drachm.\'\'Yet you are fond of the learned, too; and as for poetry, why, yourhouse is literally eloquent with AEschylus and Homer, the epic and thedrama.\'\'Yes, but those Romans who mimic my Athenian ancestors do everything soheavily.  Even in the chase they make their slaves carry Plato withthem; and whenever the boar is lost, out they take their books and theirpapyrus, in order not to lose their time too. When the dancing-girlsswim before them in all the blandishment of Persian manners, some droneof a freedman, with a face of stone, reads them a section of Cicero ""DeOfficiis"".  Unskilful pharmacists! pleasure and study are not elementsto be thus mixed together, they must be enjoyed separately: the Romanslose both by this pragmatical affectation of refinement, and prove thatthey have no souls for either. Oh, my Clodius, how little yourcountrymen know of the true versatility of a Pericles, of the truewitcheries of an Aspasia!  It was but the other day that I paid a visitto Pliny: he was sitting in his summer-house writing, while anunfortunate slave played on the tibia.  His nephew (oh! whip me suchphilosophical coxcombs!) was reading Thucydides\' description of theplague, and nodding his conceited little head in time to the music,while his lips were repeating all the loathsome details of that terribledelineation. The puppy saw nothing incongruous in learning at the sametime a ditty of love and a description of the plague.\'\'Why, they are much the same thing,\' said Clodius.\'So I told him, in excuse for his coxcombry--but my youth stared merebukingly in the face, without taking the jest, and answered, that itwas only the insensate ear that the music pleased, whereas the book (thedescription of the plague, mind you!) elevated the heart.  ""Ah!"" quoththe fat uncle, wheezing, ""my boy is quite an Athenian, always mixing theutile with the dulce."" O Minerva, how I laughed in my sleeve!  While Iwas there, they came to tell the boy-sophist that his favorite freedmanwas just dead of a fever.  ""Inexorable death!"" cried he; ""get me myHorace.  How beautifully the sweet poet consoles us for thesemisfortunes!""  Oh, can these men love, my Clodius?  Scarcely even withthe senses.  How rarely a Roman has a heart!  He is but the mechanism ofgenius--he wants its bones and flesh.\'Though Clodius was secretly a little sore at these remarks on hiscountrymen, he affected to sympathize with his friend, partly because hewas by nature a parasite, and partly because it was the fashion amongthe dissolute young Romans to affect a little contempt for the verybirth which, in reality, made them so arrogant; it was the mode toimitate the Greeks, and yet to laugh at their own clumsy imitation.Thus conversing, their steps were arrested by a crowd gathered round anopen space where three streets met; and, just where the porticoes of alight and graceful temple threw their shade, there stood a young girl,with a flower-basket on her right arm, and a small three-stringedinstrument of music in the left hand, to whose low and soft tones shewas modulating a wild and half-barbaric air.  At every pause in themusic she gracefully waved her flower-basket round, inviting theloiterers to buy; and many a sesterce was showered into the basket,either in compliment to the music or in compassion to thesongstress--for she was blind.\'It is my poor Thessalian,\' said Glaucus, stopping; \'I have not seen hersince my return to Pompeii.  Hush! her voice is sweet; let us listen.\'          THE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL\'S SONG                    I.         Buy my flowers--O buy--I pray!           The blind girl comes from afar;         If the earth be as fair as I hear them say,           These flowers her children are!         Do they her beauty keep?           They are fresh from her lap, I know;         For I caught them fast asleep           In her arms an hour ago.           With the air which is her breath--          Her soft and delicate breath--          Over them murmuring low!        On their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet,        And their cheeks with her tender tears are wet.        For she weeps--that gentle mother weeps--       (As morn and night her watch she keeps,        With a yearning heart and a passionate care)        To see the young things grow so fair;           She weeps--for love she weeps;           And the dews are the tears she weeps           From the well of a mother\'s love!                    II.         Ye have a world of light,           Where love in the loved rejoices;         But the blind girl\'s home is the House of Night,           And its beings are empty voices.           As one in the realm below,           I stand by the streams of woe!           I hear the vain shadows glide,           I feel their soft breath at my side.             And I thirst the loved forms to see,           And I stretch my fond arms around,           And I catch but a shapeless sound,           For the living are ghosts to me.            Come buy--come buy?--          (Hark! how the sweet things sigh           For they have a voice like ours),           `The breath of the blind girl closes           The leaves of the saddening roses--          We are tender, we sons of light,           We shrink from this child of night;           From the grasp of the blind girl free us--          We yearn for the eyes that see us--         We are for night too gay,           In your eyes we behold the day--             O buy--O buy the flowers!\'\'I must have yon bunch of violets, sweet Nydia,\' said Glaucus, pressingthrough the crowd, and dropping a handful of small coins into thebasket; \'your voice is more charming than ever.\'The blind girl started forward as she heard the Athenian\'s voice; thenas suddenly paused, while the blood rushed violently over neck, cheek,and temples.\'So you are returned!\' said she, in a low voice; and then repeated halfto herself, \'Glaucus is returned!\'\'Yes, child, I have not been at Pompeii above a few days.  My gardenwants your care, as before; you will visit it, I trust, to-morrow.  Andmind, no garlands at my house shall be woven by any hands but those ofthe pretty Nydia.\'Nydia smiled joyously, but did not answer; and Glaucus, placing in hisbreast the violets he had selected, turned gaily and carelessly from thecrowd.\'So she is a sort of client of yours, this child?\' said Clodius.\'Ay--does she not sing prettily?  She interests me, the poor slave!Besides, she is from the land of the Gods\' hill--Olympus frowned uponher cradle--she is of Thessaly.\'\'The witches\' country.\'\'True: but for my part I find every woman a witch; and at Pompeii, byVenus! the very air seems to have taken a love-philtre, so handsome doesevery face without a beard seem in my eyes.\'\'And lo! one of the handsomest in Pompeii, old Diomed\'s daughter, therich Julia!\' said Clodius, as a young lady, her face covered by herveil, and attended by two female slaves, approached them, in her way tothe baths.\'Fair Julia, we salute thee!\' said Clodius.Julia partly raised her veil, so as with some coquetry to display a boldRoman profile, a full dark bright eye, and a cheek over whose naturalolive art shed a fairer and softer rose.\'And Glaucus, too, is returned!\' said she, glancing meaningly at theAthenian.  \'Has he forgotten,\' she added, in a half-whisper, \'hisfriends of the last year?\'\'Beautiful Julia! even Lethe itself, if it disappear in one part of theearth, rises again in another.  Jupiter does not allow us ever to forgetfor more than a moment: but Venus, more harsh still, vouchsafes not evena moment\'s oblivion.\'\'Glaucus is never at a loss for fair words.\'\'Who is, when the object of them is so fair?\'\'We shall see you both at my father\'s villa soon,\' said Julia, turningto Clodius.\'We will mark the day in which we visit you with a white stone,\'answered the gamester.Julia dropped her veil, but slowly, so that her last glance rested onthe Athenian with affected timidity and real boldness; the glancebespoke tenderness and reproach.The friends passed on.\'Julia is certainly handsome,\' said Glaucus.\'And last year you would have made that confession in a warmer tone.\'\'True; I was dazzled at the first sight, and mistook for a gem thatwhich was but an artful imitation.\'\'Nay,\' returned Clodius, \'all women are the same at heart.  Happy he whoweds a handsome face and a large dower.  What more can he desire?\'Glaucus sighed.They were now in a street less crowded than the rest, at the end ofwhich they beheld that broad and most lovely sea, which upon thosedelicious coasts seems to have renounced its prerogative of terror--sosoft are the crisping winds that hover around its bosom, so glowing andso various are the hues which it takes from the rosy clouds, so fragrantare the perfumes which the breezes from the land scatter over itsdepths.  From such a sea might you well believe that Aphrodite rose totake the empire of the earth.\'It is still early for the bath,\' said the Greek, who was the creatureof every poetical impulse; \'let us wander from the crowded city, andlook upon the sea while the noon yet laughs along its billows.\'\'With all my heart,\' said Clodius; \'and the bay, too, is always the mostanimated part of the city.\'Pompeii was the miniature of the civilization of that age. Within thenarrow compass of its walls was contained, as it were, a specimen ofevery gift which luxury offered to power.  In its minute but glitteringshops, its tiny palaces, its baths, its forum, its theatre, itscircus--in the energy yet corruption, in the refinement yet the vice, ofits people, you beheld a model of the whole empire. It was a toy, aplaything, a showbox, in which the gods seemed pleased to keep therepresentation of the great monarchy of earth, and which they afterwardshid from time, to give to the wonder of posterity--the moral of themaxim, that under the sun there is nothing new.Crowded in the glassy bay were the vessels of commerce and the gildedgalleys for the pleasures of the rich citizens.  The boats of thefishermen glided rapidly to and fro; and afar off you saw the tall mastsof the fleet under the command of Pliny.  Upon the shore sat a Sicilianwho, with vehement gestures and flexile features, was narrating to agroup of fishermen and peasants a strange tale of shipwrecked marinersand friendly dolphins--just as at this day, in the modern neighborhood,you may hear upon the Mole of Naples.Drawing his comrade from the crowd, the Greek bent his steps towards asolitary part of the beach, and the two friends, seated on a small cragwhich rose amidst the smooth pebbles, inhaled the voluptuous and coolingbreeze, which dancing over the waters, kept music with its invisiblefeet. There was, perhaps, something in the scene that invited them tosilence and reverie.  Clodius, shading his eyes from the burning sky,was calculating the gains of the last week; and the Greek, leaning uponhis hand, and shrinking not from that sun--his nation\'s tutelarydeity--with whose fluent light of poesy, and joy, and love, his ownveins were filled, gazed upon the broad expanse, and envied, perhaps,every wind that bent its pinions towards the shores of Greece.\'Tell me, Clodius,\' said the Greek at last, \'hast thou ever been inlove?\'\'Yes, very often.\'\'He who has loved often,\' answered Glaucus, \'has loved never. There isbut one Eros, though there are many counterfeits of him.\'\'The counterfeits are not bad little gods, upon the whole,\' answeredClodius.\'I agree with you,\' returned the Greek.  \'I adore even the shadow ofLove; but I adore himself yet more.\'\'Art thou, then, soberly and honestly in love?  Hast thou that feelingwhich the poets describe--a feeling that makes us neglect our suppers,forswear the theatre, and write elegies?  I should never have thoughtit.  You dissemble well.\'\'I am not far gone enough for that,\' returned Glaucus, smiling, \'orrather I say with Tibullus--He whom love rules, where\'er his path may be, Walks safe and sacred.In fact, I am not in love; but I could be if there were but occasion tosee the object.  Eros would light his torch, but the priests have givenhim no oil.\'\'Shall I guess the object?--Is it not Diomed\'s daughter?  She adoresyou, and does not affect to conceal it; and, by Hercules, I say againand again, she is both handsome and rich.  She will bind the door-postsof her husband with golden fillets.\'\'No, I do not desire to sell myself.  Diomed\'s daughter is handsome, Igrant: and at one time, had she not been the grandchild of a freedman, Imight have...  Yet no--she carries all her beauty in her face; hermanners are not maiden-like, and her mind knows no culture save that ofpleasure.\'\'You are ungrateful.  Tell me, then, who is the fortunate virgin?\'\'You shall hear, my Clodius.  Several months ago I was sojourning atNeapolis, a city utterly to my own heart, for it still retains themanners and stamp of its Grecian origin--and it yet merits the name ofParthenope, from its delicious air and its beautiful shores. One day Ientered the temple of Minerva, to offer up my prayers, not for myselfmore than for the city on which Pallas smiles no longer. The temple wasempty and deserted. The recollections of Athens crowded fast andmeltingly upon me: imagining myself still alone in the temple, andabsorbed in the earnestness of my devotion, my prayer gushed from myheart to my lips, and I wept as I prayed. I was startled in the midst ofmy devotions, however, by a deep sigh; I turned suddenly round, and justbehind me was a female.  She had raised her veil also in prayer: andwhen our eyes met, methought a celestial ray shot from those dark andsmiling orbs at once into my soul.  Never, my Clodius, have I seenmortal face more exquisitely molded: a certain melancholy softened andyet elevated its expression: that unutterable something, which springsfrom the soul, and which our sculptors have imparted to the aspect ofPsyche, gave her beauty I know not what of divine and noble; tears wererolling down her eyes.  I guessed at once that she was also of Athenianlineage; and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded tomine. I spoke to her, though with a faltering voice--""Art thou not, too,Athenian?"" said I, ""O beautiful virgin!"" At the sound of my voice sheblushed, and half drew her veil across her face.--""My forefathers\'ashes,"" said she, ""repose by the waters of Ilissus: my birth is ofNeapolis; but my heart, as my lineage, is Athenian.""--""Let us, then,""said I, ""make our offerings together"": and, as the priest now appeared,we stood side by side, while we followed the priest in his ceremonialprayer; together we touched the knees of the goddess--together we laidour olive garlands on the altar. I felt a strange emotion of almostsacred tenderness at this companionship. We, strangers from a far andfallen land, stood together and alone in that temple of our country\'sdeity: was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman,for so I might surely call her?  I felt as if I had known her for years;and that simple rite seemed, as by a miracle, to operate on thesympathies and ties of time.  Silently we left the temple, and I wasabout to ask her where she dwelt, and if I might be permitted to visither, when a youth, in whose features there was some kindred resemblanceto her own, and who stood upon the steps of the fane, took her by thehand.  She turned round and bade me farewell.  The crowd separated us: Isaw her no more.  On reaching my home I found letters, which obliged meto set out for Athens, for my relations threatened me with litigationconcerning my inheritance. When that suit was happily over, I repairedonce more to Neapolis; I instituted inquiries throughout the whole city,I could discover no clue of my lost countrywoman, and, hoping to lose ingaiety all remembrance of that beautiful apparition, I hastened toplunge myself amidst the luxuries of Pompeii.  This is all my history.I do not love; but I remember and regret.\'As Clodius was about to reply, a slow and stately step approached them,and at the sound it made amongst the pebbles, each turned, and eachrecognized the new-comer.It was a man who had scarcely reached his fortieth year, of tallstature, and of a thin but nervous and sinewy frame.  His skin, dark andbronzed, betrayed his Eastern origin; and his features had somethingGreek in their outline (especially in the chin, the lip, and the brow),save that the nose was somewhat raised and aquiline; and the bones, hardand visible, forbade that fleshy and waving contour which on the Grecianphysiognomy preserved even in manhood the round and beautiful curves ofyouth.  His eyes, large and black as the deepest night, shone with novarying and uncertain lustre. A deep, thoughtful, and half-melancholycalm seemed unalterably fixed in their majestic and commanding gaze.His step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty, and somethingforeign in the fashion and the sober hues of his sweeping garments addedto the impressive effect of his quiet countenance and stately form.Each of the young men, in saluting the new-comer, made mechanically, andwith care to conceal it from him, a slight gesture or sign with theirfingers; for Arbaces, the Egyptian, was supposed to possess the fatalgift of the evil eye.\'The scene must, indeed, be beautiful,\' said Arbaces, with a cold thoughcourteous smile, \'which draws the gay Clodius, and Glaucus the alladmired, from the crowded thoroughfares of the city.\'\'Is Nature ordinarily so unattractive?\' asked the Greek.\'To the dissipated--yes.\'\'An austere reply, but scarcely a wise one.  Pleasure delights incontrasts; it is from dissipation that we learn to enjoy solitude, andfrom solitude dissipation.\'\'So think the young philosophers of the Garden,\' replied the Egyptian;\'they mistake lassitude for meditation, and imagine that, because theyare sated with others, they know the delight of loneliness.  But not insuch jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone drawsfrom her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty: she demands fromyou, not the exhaustion of passion, but all that fervor, from which youonly seek, in adoring her, a release.  When, young Athenian, the moonrevealed herself in visions of light to Endymion, it was after a daypassed, not amongst the feverish haunts of men, but on the stillmountains and in the solitary valleys of the hunter.\'\'Beautiful simile!\' cried Glaucus; \'most unjust application! Exhaustion!that word is for age, not youth.  By me, at least, one moment of satietyhas never been known!\'Again the Egyptian smiled, but his smile was cold and blighting, andeven the unimaginative Clodius froze beneath its light.  He did not,however, reply to the passionate exclamation of Glaucus; but, after apause, he said, in a soft and melancholy voice:\'After all, you do right to enjoy the hour while it smiles for you; therose soon withers, the perfume soon exhales.  And we, O Glaucus!strangers in the land and far from our fathers\' ashes, what is thereleft for us but pleasure or regret!--for you the first, perhaps for methe last.\'The bright eyes of the Greek were suddenly suffused with tears. \'Ah,speak not, Arbaces,\' he cried--\'speak not of our ancestors.  Let usforget that there were ever other liberties than those of Rome!  AndGlory!--oh, vainly would we call her ghost from the fields of Marathonand Thermopylae!\'\'Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest,\' said the Egyptian; \'and inthy gaieties this night, thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than ofLais. Vale!\'Thus saying, he gathered his robe around him, and slowly swept away.\'I breathe more freely,\' said Clodius.  \'Imitating the Egyptians, wesometimes introduce a skeleton at our feasts.  In truth, the presence ofsuch an Egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre enough to sour therichest grape of the Falernian.\'\'Strange man! said Glaucus, musingly; \'yet dead though he seem topleasure, and cold to the objects of the world, scandal belies him, orhis house and his heart could tell a different tale.\'\'Ah! there are whispers of other orgies than those of Osiris in hisgloomy mansion.  He is rich, too, they say.  Can we not get him amongstus, and teach him the charms of dice?  Pleasure of pleasures! hot feverof hope and fear! inexpressible unjaded passion! how fiercely beautifulthou art, O Gaming!\'\'Inspired--inspired!\' cried Glaucus, laughing; \'the oracle speaks poetryin Clodius.  What miracle next!\'Chapter IIIPARENTAGE OF GLAUCUS.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES OF POMPEII. CLASSICREVEL.HEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one: it had given himbeauty, health, fortune, genius, illustrious descent, a heart of fire, amind of poetry; but it had denied him the heritage of freedom. He wasborn in Athens, the subject of Rome.  Succeeding early to an ampleinheritance, he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural tothe young, and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasureamidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court.He was an Alcibiades without ambition.  He was what a man ofimagination, youth, fortune, and talents, readily becomes when youdeprive him of the inspiration of glory.  His house at Rome was thetheme of the debauchees, but also of the lovers of art; and thesculptors of Greece delighted to task their skill in adorning theporticoes and exedrae of an Athenian.  His retreat in Pompeii--alas! thecolors are faded now, the walls stripped of their paintings!--its mainbeauty, its elaborate finish of grace and ornament, is gone; yet whenfirst given once more to the day, what eulogies, what wonder, did itsminute and glowing decorations create--its paintings--its mosaics!Passionately enamoured of poetry and the drama, which recalled toGlaucus the wit and the heroism of his race, that fairy mansion wasadorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer.  And antiquaries,who resolve taste to a trade, have turned the patron to the professor,and still (though the error is now acknowledged) they style in custom,as they first named in mistake, the disburied house of the AthenianGlaucus \'THE HOUSE OF THE DRAMATIC POET\'.Previous to our description of this house, it may be as well to conveyto the reader a general notion of the houses of Pompeii, which he willfind to resemble strongly the plans of Vitruvius; but with all thosedifferences in detail, of caprice and taste, which being natural tomankind, have always puzzled antiquaries.  We shall endeavor to makethis description as clear and unpedantic as possible.You enter then, usually, by a small entrance-passage (calledcestibulum), into a hall, sometimes with (but more frequently without)the ornament of columns; around three sides of this hall are doorscommunicating with several bedchambers (among which is the porter\'s),the best of these being usually appropriated to country visitors.  Atthe extremity of the hall, on either side to the right and left, if thehouse is large, there are two small recesses, rather than chambers,generally devoted to the ladies of the mansion; and in the centre of thetessellated pavement of the hall is invariably a square, shallowreservoir for rain water (classically termed impluvium), which wasadmitted by an aperture in the roof above; the said aperture beingcovered at will by an awning.  Near this impluvium, which had a peculiarsanctity in the eyes of the ancients, were sometimes (but at Pompeiimore rarely than at Rome) placed images of the household gods--thehospitable hearth, often mentioned by the Roman poets, and consecratedto the Lares, was at Pompeii almost invariably formed by a movablebrazier; while in some corner, often the most ostentatious place, wasdeposited a huge wooden chest, ornamented and strengthened by bands ofbronze or iron, and secured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal sofirmly as to defy the attempts of any robber to detach it from itsposition. It is supposed that this chest was the money-box, or coffer,of the master of the house; though as no money has been found in any ofthe chests discovered at Pompeii, it is probable that it was sometimesrather designed for ornament than use.In this hall (or atrium, to speak classically) the clients and visitorsof inferior rank were usually received.  In the houses of the more\'respectable\', an atriensis, or slave peculiarly devoted to the serviceof the hall, was invariably retained, and his rank among hisfellow-slaves was high and important.  The reservoir in the centre musthave been rather a dangerous ornament, but the centre of the hall waslike the grass-plot of a college, and interdicted to the passers to andfro, who found ample space in the margin.  Right opposite the entrance,at the other end of the hall, was an apartment (tablinum), in which thepavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics, and the walls coveredwith elaborate paintings.  Here were usually kept the records of thefamily, or those of any public office that had been filled by the owner:on one side of this saloon, if we may so call it, was often adining-room, or triclinium; on the other side, perhaps, what we shouldnow term a cabinet of gems, containing whatever curiosities were deemedmost rare and costly; and invariably a small passage for the slaves tocross to the further parts of the house, without passing the apartmentsthus mentioned.  These rooms all opened on a square or oblong colonnade,technically termed peristyle.  If the house was small, its boundaryceased with this colonnade; and in that case its centre, howeverdiminutive, was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a garden, andadorned with vases of flowers, placed upon pedestals: while, under thecolonnade, to the right and left, were doors admitting to bedrooms, to asecond triclinium, or eating-room (for the ancients generallyappropriated two rooms at least to that purpose, one for summer, and onefor winter--or, perhaps, one for ordinary, the other for festive,occasions); and if the owner affected letters, a cabinet, dignified bythe name of library--for a very small room was sufficient to contain thefew rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable collection ofbooks.At the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen.  Supposing thehouse was large, it did not end with the peristyle, and the centrethereof was not in that case a garden, but might be, perhaps, adornedwith a fountain, or basin for fish; and at its end, exactly opposite tothe tablinum, was generally another eating-room, on either side of whichwere bedrooms, and, perhaps, a picture-saloon, or pinacotheca.  Theseapartments communicated again with a square or oblong space, usuallyadorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle, and verymuch resembling the peristyle, only usually longer.  This was the properviridarium, or garden, being commonly adorned with a fountain, orstatues, and a profusion of gay flowers: at its extreme end was thegardener\'s house; on either side, beneath the colonnade, were sometimes,if the size of the family required it, additional rooms.At Pompeii, a second or third story was rarely of importance, beingbuilt only above a small part of the house, and containing rooms for theslaves; differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices ofRome, which generally contained the principal eating-room (orcaenaculum) on the second floor.  The apartments themselves wereordinarily of small size; for in those delightful climes they receivedany extraordinary number of visitors in the peristyle (or portico), thehall, or the garden; and even their banquet-rooms, however elaboratelyadorned and carefully selected in point of aspect, were of diminutiveproportions; for the intellectual ancients, being fond of society, notof crowds, rarely feasted more than nine at a time, so that largedinner-rooms were not so necessary with them as with us. But the suiteof rooms seen at once from the entrance, must have had a very imposingeffect: you beheld at once the hall richly paved and painted--thetablinum--the graceful peristyle, and (if the house extended farther)the opposite banquet-room and the garden, which closed the view withsome gushing fount or marble statue.The reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses,which resembled in some respects the Grecian, but mostly the Romanfashion of domestic architecture.  In almost every house there is somedifference in detail from the rest, but the principal outline is thesame in all.  In all you find the hall, the tablinum, and the peristyle,communicating with each other; in all you find the walls richly painted;and all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegancies oflife.  The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is,however, questionable: they were fond of the gaudiest colors, offantastic designs; they often painted the lower half of their columns abright red, leaving the rest uncolored; and where the garden was small,its wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent,imitating trees, birds, temples, etc., in perspective--a meretriciousdelusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted, with acomplacent pride in its ingenuity.But the house of Glaucus was at once one of the smallest, and yet one ofthe most adorned and finished of all the private mansions of Pompeii: itwould be a model at this day for the house of \'a single man inMayfair\'--the envy and despair of the coelibian purchasers of buhland marquetry.You enter by a long and narrow vestibule, on the floor of which is theimage of a dog in mosaic, with the well-known \'Cave canem\'--or \'Bewarethe dog\'. On either side is a chamber of some size; for the interiorpart of the house not being large enough to contain the two greatdivisions of private and public apartments, these two rooms were setapart for the reception of visitors who neither by rank nor familiaritywere entitled to admission in the penetralia of the mansion.Advancing up the vestibule you enter an atrium, that when firstdiscovered was rich in paintings, which in point of expression wouldscarcely disgrace a Rafaele.  You may see them now transplanted to theNeapolitan Museum: they are still the admiration of connoisseurs--theydepict the parting of Achilles and Briseis.  Who does not acknowledgethe force, the vigour, the beauty, employed in delineating the forms andfaces of Achilles and the immortal slave!On one side the atrium, a small staircase admitted to the apartments forthe slaves on the second floor; there also were two or three smallbedrooms, the walls of which portrayed the rape of Europa, the battle ofthe Amazons, etc.You now enter the tablinum, across which, at either end, hung richdraperies of Tyrian purple, half withdrawn.  On the walls was depicted apoet reading his verses to his friends; and in the pavement was inserteda small and most exquisite mosaic, typical of the instructions given bythe director of the stage to his comedians.You passed through this saloon and entered the peristyle; and here (as Ihave said before was usually the case with the smaller houses ofPompeii) the mansion ended.  From each of the seven columns that adornedthis court hung festoons of garlands: the centre, supplying the place ofa garden, bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of whitemarble, that were supported on pedestals.  At the left hand of thissmall garden was a diminutive fane, resembling one of those smallchapels placed at the side of roads in Catholic countries, and dedicatedto the Penates; before it stood a bronzed tripod: to the left of thecolonnade were two small cubicula, or bedrooms; to the right was thetriclinium, in which the guests were now assembled.This room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples \'The Chamber ofLeda\'; and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell, the reader willfind an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Ledapresenting her newborn to her husband, from which the room derives itsname. This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden.  Roundthe table of citrean wood, highly polished and delicately wrought withsilver arabesques, were placed the three couches, which were yet morecommon at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately intofashion at Rome: and on these couches of bronze, studded with richermetals, were laid thick quiltings covered with elaborate broidery, andyielding luxuriously to the pressure.\'Well, I must own,\' said the aedile Pansa, \'that your house, thoughscarcely larger than a case for one\'s fibulae, is a gem of its kind.How beautifully painted is that parting of Achilles and Briseis!--what astyle!--what heads!--what a-hem!\'\'Praise from Pansa is indeed valuable on such subjects,\' said Clodius,gravely.  \'Why, the paintings on his walls!--Ah! there is, indeed, thehand of a Zeuxis!\'\'You flatter me, my Clodius; indeed you do,\' quoth the aedile, who wascelebrated through Pompeii for having the worst paintings in the world;for he was patriotic, and patronized none but Pompeians.  \'You flatterme; but there is something pretty--AEdepol, yes--in the colors, to saynothing of the design--and then for the kitchen, my friends--ah! thatwas all my fancy.\'\'What is the design?\' said Glaucus.  \'I have not yet seen your kitchen,though I have often witnessed the excellence of its cheer.\'\'A cook, my Athenian--a cook sacrificing the trophies of his skill onthe altar of Vesta, with a beautiful muraena (taken from the life) on aspit at a distance--there is some invention there!\'At that instant the slaves appeared, bearing a tray covered with thefirst preparative initia of the feast.  Amidst delicious figs, freshherbs strewed with snow, anchovies, and eggs, were ranged small cups ofdiluted wine sparingly mixed with honey.  As these were placed on thetable, young slaves bore round to each of the five guests (for therewere no more) the silver basin of perfumed water, and napkins edged witha purple fringe.  But the aedile ostentatiously drew forth his ownnapkin, which was not, indeed, of so fine a linen, but in which thefringe was twice as broad, and wiped his hands with the parade of a manwho felt he was calling for admiration.\'A splendid nappa that of yours,\' said Clodius; \'why, the fringe is asbroad as a girdle!\'\'A trifle, my Clodius: a trifle!  They tell me this stripe is the latestfashion at Rome; but Glaucus attends to these things more than I.\'\'Be propitious, O Bacchus!\' said Glaucus, inclining reverentially to abeautiful image of the god placed in the centre of the table, at thecorners of which stood the Lares and the salt-holders.  The guestsfollowed the prayer, and then, sprinkling the wine on the table, theyperformed the wonted libation.This over, the convivialists reclined themselves on the couches, and thebusiness of the hour commenced.\'May this cup be my last!\' said the young Sallust, as the table, clearedof its first stimulants, was now loaded with the substantial part of theentertainment, and the ministering slave poured forth to him a brimmingcyathus--\'May this cup be my last, but it is the best wine I have drunkat Pompeii!\'\'Bring hither the amphora,\' said Glaucus, \'and read its date and itscharacter.\'The slave hastened to inform the party that the scroll fastened to thecork betokened its birth from Chios, and its age a ripe fifty years.\'How deliciously the snow has cooled it!\' said Pansa.  \'It is justenough.\'\'It is like the experience of a man who has cooled his pleasuressufficiently to give them a double zest,\' exclaimed Sallust.\'It is like a woman\'s ""No"",\' added Glaucus: \'it cools, but to inflamethe more.\'\'When is our next wild-beast fight?\' said Clodius to Pansa.\'It stands fixed for the ninth ide of August,\' answered Pansa: \'on theday after the Vulcanalia--we have a most lovely young lion for theoccasion.\'\'Whom shall we get for him to eat?\' asked Clodius.  \'Alas! there is agreat scarcity of criminals.  You must positively find some innocent orother to condemn to the lion, Pansa!\'\'Indeed I have thought very seriously about it of late,\' replied theaedile, gravely.  \'It was a most infamous law that which forbade us tosend our own slaves to the wild beasts.  Not to let us do what we likewith our own, that\'s what I call an infringement on property itself.\'\'Not so in the good old days of the Republic,\' sighed Sallust.\'And then this pretended mercy to the slaves is such a disappointment tothe poor people.  How they do love to see a good tough battle between aman and a lion; and all this innocent pleasure they may lose (if thegods don\'t send us a good criminal soon) from this cursed law!\'\'What can be worse policy,\' said Clodius, sententiously, \'than tointerfere with the manly amusements of the people?\'\'Well thank Jupiter and the Fates! we have no Nero at present,\' saidSallust.\'He was, indeed, a tyrant; he shut up our amphitheatre for ten years.\'\'I wonder it did not create a rebellion,\' said Sallust.\'It very nearly did,\' returned Pansa, with his mouth full of wild boar.Here the conversation was interrupted for a moment by a flourish offlutes, and two slaves entered with a single dish.\'Ah, what delicacy hast thou in store for us now, my Glaucus?\' cried theyoung Sallust, with sparkling eyes.Sallust was only twenty-four, but he had no pleasure in life likeeating--perhaps he had exhausted all the others: yet had he some talent,and an excellent heart--as far as it went.\'I know its face, by Pollux!\' cried Pansa.  \'It is an Ambracian Kid.  Ho(snapping his fingers, a usual signal to the slaves) we must prepare anew libation in honour to the new-comer.\'\'I had hoped said Glaucus,\' in a melancholy tone, \'to have procured yousome oysters from Britain; but the winds that were so cruel to Caesarhave forbid us the oysters.\'\'Are they in truth so delicious?\' asked Lepidus, loosening to a yet moreluxurious ease his ungirdled tunic.\'Why, in truth, I suspect it is the distance that gives the flavor; theywant the richness of the Brundusium oyster.  But, at Rome, no supper iscomplete without them.\'\'The poor Britons!  There is some good in them after all,\' said Sallust.\'They produce an oyster.\'\'I wish they would produce us a gladiator,\' said the aedile, whoseprovident mind was musing over the wants of the amphitheatre.\'By Pallas!\' cried Glaucus, as his favorite slave crowned his streaminglocks with a new chaplet, \'I love these wild spectacles well enough whenbeast fights beast; but when a man, one with bones and blood like ours,is coldly put on the arena, and torn limb from limb, the interest is toohorrid: I sicken--I gasp for breath--I long to rush and defend him.  Theyells of the populace seem to me more dire than the voices of the Furieschasing Orestes.  I rejoice that there is so little chance of thatbloody exhibition for our next show!\'The aedile shrugged his shoulders.  The young Sallust, who was thoughtthe best-natured man in Pompeii, stared in surprise.  The gracefulLepidus, who rarely spoke for fear of disturbing his features,ejaculated \'Hercle!\' The parasite Clodius muttered \'AEdepol!\' and thesixth banqueter, who was the umbra of Clodius, and whose duty it was toecho his richer friend, when he could not praise him--the parasite of aparasite--muttered also \'AEdepol!\'\'Well, you Italians are used to these spectacles; we Greeks are moremerciful.  Ah, shade of Pindar!--the rapture of a true Grecian game--theemulation of man against man--the generous strife--the half-mournfultriumph--so proud to contend with a noble foe, so sad to see himovercome! But ye understand me not.\'\'The kid is excellent,\' said Sallust.  The slave, whose duty it was tocarve, and who valued himself on his science, had just performed thatoffice on the kid to the sound of music, his knife keeping time,beginning with a low tenor and accomplishing the arduous feat amidst amagnificent diapason.\'Your cook is, of course, from Sicily?\' said Pansa.\'Yes, of Syracuse.\'\'I will play you for him,\' said Clodius.  \'We will have a game betweenthe courses.\'\'Better that sort of game, certainly, than a beast fight; but I cannotstake my Sicilian--you have nothing so precious to stake me in return.\'\'My Phillida--my beautiful dancing-girl!\'\'I never buy women,\' said the Greek, carelessly rearranging his chaplet.The musicians, who were stationed in the portico without, had commencedtheir office with the kid; they now directed the melody into a moresoft, a more gay, yet it may be a more intellectual strain; and theychanted that song of Horace beginning \'Persicos odi\', etc., soimpossible to translate, and which they imagined applicable to a feastthat, effeminate as it seems to us, was simple enough for the gorgeousrevelry of the time.  We are witnessing the domestic, and not theprincely feast--the entertainment of a gentleman, not an emperor or asenator.\'Ah, good old Horace!\' said Sallust, compassionately; \'he sang well offeasts and girls, but not like our modern poets.\'\'The immortal Fulvius, for instance,\' said Clodius.\'Ah, Fulvius, the immortal!\' said the umbra.\'And Spuraena; and Caius Mutius, who wrote three epics in a year--couldHorace do that, or Virgil either said Lepidus.  \'Those old poets allfell into the mistake of copying sculpture instead of painting.Simplicity and repose--that was their notion; but we moderns have fire,and passion, and energy--we never sleep, we imitate the colors ofpainting, its life, and its action.  Immortal Fulvius!\'\'By the way,\' said Sallust, \'have you seen the new ode by Spuraena, inhonour of our Egyptian Isis?  It is magnificent--the true religiousfervor.\'\'Isis seems a favorite divinity at Pompeii,\' said Glaucus.\'Yes!\' said Pansa, \'she is exceedingly in repute just at this moment;her statue has been uttering the most remarkable oracles.  I am notsuperstitious, but I must confess that she has more than once assistedme materially in my magistracy with her advice.  Her priests are sopious, too! none of your gay, none of your proud, ministers of Jupiterand Fortune: they walk barefoot, eat no meat, and pass the greater partof the night in solitary devotion!\'\'An example to our other priesthoods, indeed!--Jupiter\'s temple wantsreforming sadly,\' said Lepidus, who was a great reformer for all buthimself.\'They say that Arbaces the Egyptian has imparted some most solemnmysteries to the priests of Isis,\' observed Sallust.  \'He boasts hisdescent from the race of Rameses, and declares that in his family thesecrets of remotest antiquity are treasured.\'\'He certainly possesses the gift of the evil eye,\' said Clodius. \'If Iever come upon that Medusa front without the previous charm, I am sureto lose a favorite horse, or throw the canes nine times running.\'\'The last would be indeed a miracle!\' said Sallust, gravely.\'How mean you, Sallust?\' returned the gamester, with a flushed brow.\'I mean, what you would leave me if I played often with you; and thatis--nothing.\'Clodius answered only by a smile of disdain.\'If Arbaces were not so rich,\' said Pansa, with a stately air, \'I shouldstretch my authority a little, and inquire into the truth of the reportwhich calls him an astrologer and a sorcerer.  Agrippa, when aedile ofRome, banished all such terrible citizens.  But a rich man--it is theduty of an aedile to protect the rich!\'\'What think you of this new sect, which I am told has even a fewproselytes in Pompeii, these followers of the Hebrew God--Christus?\'\'Oh, mere speculative visionaries,\' said Clodius; \'they have not asingle gentleman amongst them; their proselytes are poor, insignificant,ignorant people!\'\'Who ought, however, to be crucified for their blasphemy,\' said Pansa,with vehemence; \'they deny Venus and Jove!  Nazarene is but another namefor atheist.  Let me catch them--that\'s all.\'The second course was gone--the feasters fell back on theircouches--there was a pause while they listened to the soft voices of theSouth, and the music of the Arcadian reed.  Glaucus was the most raptand the least inclined to break the silence, but Clodius began alreadyto think that they wasted time.\'Bene vobis! (Your health!) my Glaucus,\' said he, quaffing a cup to eachletter of the Greek\'s name, with the ease of the practised drinker.\'Will you not be avenged on your ill-fortune of yesterday? See, the dicecourt us.\'\'As you will,\' said Glaucus.\'The dice in summer, and I an aedile!\' said Pansa, magisterially; \'it isagainst all law.\'\'Not in your presence, grave Pansa,\' returned Clodius, rattling the dicein a long box; \'your presence restrains all license: it is not thething, but the excess of the thing, that hurts.\'\'What wisdom!\' muttered the umbra.\'Well, I will look another way,\' said the aedile.\'Not yet, good Pansa; let us wait till we have supped,\' said Glaucus.Clodius reluctantly yielded, concealing his vexation with a yawn.\'He gapes to devour the gold,\' whispered Lepidus to Sallust, in aquotation from the Aulularia of Plautus.\'Ah! how well I know these polypi, who hold all they touch,\' answeredSallust, in the same tone, and out of the same play.The third course, consisting of a variety of fruits, pistachio nuts,sweetmeats, tarts, and confectionery tortured into a thousand fantasticand airy shapes, was now placed upon the table; and the ministri, orattendants, also set there the wine (which had hitherto been handedround to the guests) in large jugs of glass, each bearing upon it theschedule of its age and quality.\'Taste this Lesbian, my Pansa,\' said Sallust; \'it is excellent.\'\'It is not very old,\' said Glaucus, \'but it has been made precocious,like ourselves, by being put to the fire:--the wine to the flames ofVulcan--we to those of his wife--to whose honour I pour this cup.\'\'It is delicate,\' said Pansa, \'but there is perhaps the least particletoo much of rosin in its flavor.\'\'What a beautiful cup!\' cried Clodius, taking up one of transparentcrystal, the handles of which were wrought with gems, and twisted in theshape of serpents, the favorite fashion at Pompeii.\'This ring,\' said Glaucus, taking a costly jewel from the first joint ofhis finger and hanging it on the handle, \'gives it a richer show, andrenders it less unworthy of thy acceptance, my Clodius, on whom may thegods bestow health and fortune, long and oft to crown it to the brim!\'\'You are too generous, Glaucus,\' said the gamester, handing the cup tohis slave; \'but your love gives it a double value.\'\'This cup to the Graces!\' said Pansa, and he thrice emptied his calix.The guests followed his example.\'We have appointed no director to the feast,\' cried Sallust.\'Let us throw for him, then,\' said Clodius, rattling the dice-box.\'Nay,\' cried Glaucus, \'no cold and trite director for us: no dictator ofthe banquet; no rex convivii.  Have not the Romans sworn never to obey aking? Shall we be less free than your ancestors?  Ho! musicians, let ushave the song I composed the other night: it has a verse on thissubject, ""The Bacchic hymn of the Hours"".\'The musicians struck their instruments to a wild Ionic air, while theyoungest voice in the band chanted forth, in Greek words, as numbers,the following strain:--           THE EVENING HYMN OF THE HOURS                     I     Through the summer day, through the weary day,          We have glided long;      Ere we speed to the Night through her portals grey,          Hail us with song!--         With song, with song,        With a bright and joyous song;       Such as the Cretan maid,        While the twilight made her bolder,       Woke, high through the ivy shade,        When the wine-god first consoled her.       From the hush\'d, low-breathing skies,       Half-shut look\'d their starry eyes,          And all around,          With a loving sound,        The AEgean waves were creeping:       On her lap lay the lynx\'s head;       Wild thyme was her bridal bed;       And aye through each tiny space,       In the green vine\'s green embrace       The Fauns were slily peeping--       The Fauns, the prying Fauns--      The arch, the laughing Fauns--      The Fauns were slily peeping!                     II      Flagging and faint are we        With our ceaseless flight,       And dull shall our journey be        Through the realm of night,       Bathe us, O bathe our weary wings       In the purple wave, as it freshly springs        To your cups from the fount of light--    From the fount of light--from the fount of light,     For there, when the sun has gone down in night,         There in the bowl we find him.       The grape is the well of that summer sun,       Or rather the stream that he gazed upon,       Till he left in truth, like the Thespian youth,           His soul, as he gazed, behind him.                    III      A cup to Jove, and a cup to Love,        And a cup to the son of Maia;       And honour with three, the band zone-free,        The band of the bright Aglaia.       But since every bud in the wreath of pleasure        Ye owe to the sister Hours,       No stinted cups, in a formal measure,        The Bromian law makes ours.       He honors us most who gives us most,       And boasts, with a Bacchanal\'s honest boast,        He never will count the treasure.     Fastly we fleet, then seize our wings,     And plunge us deep in the sparkling springs;     And aye, as we rise with a dripping plume,     We\'ll scatter the spray round the garland\'s bloom;           We glow--we glow,     Behold, as the girls of the Eastern wave     Bore once with a shout to the crystal cave       The prize of the Mysian Hylas,           Even so--even so,     We have caught the young god in our warm embrace     We hurry him on in our laughing race;     We hurry him on, with a whoop and song,     The cloudy rivers of night along--      Ho, ho!--we have caught thee, Psilas!The guests applauded loudly.  When the poet is your host, his verses aresure to charm.\'Thoroughly Greek,\' said Lepidus: \'the wildness, force, and energy ofthat tongue, it is impossible to imitate in the Roman poetry.\'\'It is, indeed, a great contrast,\' said Clodius, ironically at heart,though not in appearance, \'to the old-fashioned and tame simplicity ofthat ode of Horace which we heard before.  The air is beautifully Ionic:the word puts me in mind of a toast--Companions, I give you thebeautiful Ione.\'\'Ione!--the name is Greek,\' said Glaucus, in a soft voice.  \'I drink thehealth with delight.  But who is Ione?\'\'Ah! you have but just come to Pompeii, or you would deserve ostracismfor your ignorance,\' said Lepidus, conceitedly; \'not to know Ione, isnot to know the chief charm of our city.\'\'She is of the most rare beauty,\' said Pansa; \'and what a voice!\'\'She can feed only on nightingales\' tongues,\' said Clodius.\'Nightingales\' tongues!--beautiful thought!\' sighed the umbra.\'Enlighten me, I beseech you,\' said Glaucus.\'Know then...\' began Lepidus.\'Let me speak,\' cried Clodius; \'you drawl out your words as if you spoketortoises.\'\'And you speak stones,\' muttered the coxcomb to himself, as he fell backdisdainfully on his couch.\'Know then, my Glaucus,\' said Clodius, \'that Ione is a stranger who hasbut lately come to Pompeii.  She sings like Sappho, and her songs areher own composing; and as for the tibia, and the cithara, and the lyre,I know not in which she most outdoes the Muses.  Her beauty is mostdazzling.  Her house is perfect; such taste--such gems--such bronzes!She is rich, and generous as she is rich.\'\'Her lovers, of course,\' said Glaucus, \'take care that she does notstarve; and money lightly won is always lavishly spent.\'\'Her lovers--ah, there is the enigma!--Ione has but one vice--she ischaste. She has all Pompeii at her feet, and she has no lovers: she willnot even marry.\'\'No lovers!\' echoed Glaucus.\'No; she has the soul of Vestal with the girdle of Venus.\'\'What refined expressions!\' said the umbra.\'A miracle!\' cried Glaucus.  \'Can we not see her?\'\'I will take you there this evening, said Clodius; \'meanwhile...\' addedhe, once more rattling the dice.\'I am yours!\' said the complaisant Glaucus.  \'Pansa, turn your face!\'Lepidus and Sallust played at odd and even, and the umbra looked on,while Glaucus and Clodius became gradually absorbed in the chances ofthe dice.\'By Pollux!\' cried Glaucus, \'this is the second time I have thrown thecaniculae\' (the lowest throw).\'Now Venus befriend me!\' said Clodius, rattling the box for severalmoments. \'O Alma Venus--it is Venus herself!\' as he threw the highestcast, named from that goddess--whom he who wins money, indeed, usuallypropitiates!\'Venus is ungrateful to me,\' said Glaucus, gaily; \'I have alwayssacrificed on her altar.\'\'He who plays with Clodius,\' whispered Lepidus, \'will soon, likePlautus\'s Curculio, put his pallium for the stakes.\'\'Poor Glaucus!--he is as blind as Fortune herself,\' replied Sallust, inthe same tone.\'I will play no more,\' said Glaucus; \'I have lost thirty sestertia.\'\'I am sorry...\' began Clodius.\'Amiable man!\' groaned the umbra.\'Not at all!\' exclaimed Glaucus; \'the pleasure I take in your gaincompensates the pain of my loss.\'The conversation now grew general and animated; the wine circulated morefreely; and Ione once more became the subject of eulogy to the guests ofGlaucus.\'Instead of outwatching the stars, let us visit one at whose beauty thestars grow pale,\' said Lepidus.Clodius, who saw no chance of renewing the dice, seconded the proposal;and Glaucus, though he civilly pressed his guests to continue thebanquet, could not but let them see that his curiosity had been excitedby the praises of Ione: they therefore resolved to adjourn (all, atleast, but Pansa and the umbra) to the house of the fair Greek.  Theydrank, therefore, to the health of Glaucus and of Titus--they performedtheir last libation--they resumed their slippers--they descended thestairs--passed the illumined atrium--and walking unbitten over thefierce dog painted on the threshold, found themselves beneath the lightof the moon just risen, in the lively and still crowded streets ofPompeii.They passed the jewellers\' quarter, sparkling with lights, caught andreflected by the gems displayed in the shops, and arrived at last at thedoor of Ione.  The vestibule blazed with rows of lamps; curtains ofembroidered purple hung on either aperture of the tablinum, whose wallsand mosaic pavement glowed with the richest colors of the artist; andunder the portico which surrounded the odorous viridarium they foundIone, already surrounded by adoring and applauding guests!\'Did you say she was Athenian?\' whispered Glaucus, ere he passed intothe peristyle.\'No, she is from Neapolis.\'\'Neapolis!\' echoed Glaucus; and at that moment the group, dividing oneither side of Ione, gave to his view that bright, that nymph-likebeauty, which for months had shone down upon the waters of his memory.Chapter IVTHE TEMPLE OF ISIS.  ITS PRIEST.  THE CHARACTER OF ARBACES DEVELOPSITSELF.THE story returns to the Egyptian.  We left Arbaces upon the shores ofthe noonday sea, after he had parted from Glaucus and his companion.  Ashe approached to the more crowded part of the bay, he paused and gazedupon that animated scene with folded arms, and a bitter smile upon hisdark features.\'Gulls, dupes, fools, that ye are!\' muttered he to himself; \'whetherbusiness or pleasure, trade or religion, be your pursuit, you areequally cheated by the passions that ye should rule!  How I could loatheyou, if I did not hate--yes, hate!  Greek or Roman, it is from us, fromthe dark lore of Egypt, that ye have stolen the fire that gives yousouls.  Your knowledge--your poesy--your laws--your arts--your barbarousmastery of war (all how tame and mutilated, when compared with the vastoriginal!)--ye have filched, as a slave filches the fragments of thefeast, from us!  And now, ye mimics of a mimic!--Romans, forsooth! themushroom herd of robbers! ye are our masters! the pyramids look down nomore on the race of Rameses--the eagle cowers over the serpent of theNile.  Our masters--no, not mine.  My soul, by the power of its wisdom,controls and chains you, though the fetters are unseen.  So long ascraft can master force, so long as religion has a cave from whichoracles can dupe mankind, the wise hold an empire over earth.  Even fromyour vices Arbaces distills his pleasures--pleasures unprofaned byvulgar eyes--pleasures vast, wealthy, inexhaustible, of which yourenervate minds, in their unimaginative sensuality, cannot conceive ordream!  Plod on, plod on, fools of ambition and of avarice! your pettythirst for fasces and quaestorships, and all the mummery of servilepower, provokes my laughter and my scorn.  My power can extend whereverman believes.  I ride over the souls that the purple veils.  Thebes mayfall, Egypt be a name; the world itself furnishes the subjects ofArbaces.\'Thus saying, the Egyptian moved slowly on; and, entering the town, histall figure towered above the crowded throng of the forum, and swepttowards the small but graceful temple consecrated to Isis.That edifice was then but of recent erection; the ancient temple hadbeen thrown down in the earthquake sixteen years before, and the newbuilding had become as much in vogue with the versatile Pompeians as anew church or a new preacher may be with us.  The oracles of the goddessat Pompeii were indeed remarkable, not more for the mysterious languagein which they were clothed, than for the credit which was attached totheir mandates and predictions.  If they were not dictated by adivinity, they were framed at least by a profound knowledge of mankind;they applied themselves exactly to the circumstances of individuals, andmade a notable contrast to the vague and loose generalities of theirrival temples.  As Arbaces now arrived at the rails which separated theprofane from the sacred place, a crowd, composed of all classes, butespecially of the commercial, collected, breathless and reverential,before the many altars which rose in the open court.  In the walls ofthe cella, elevated on seven steps of Parian marble, various statuesstood in niches, and those walls were ornamented with the pomegranateconsecrated to Isis.  An oblong pedestal occupied the interior building,on which stood two statues, one of Isis, and its companion representedthe silent and mystic Orus.  But the building contained many otherdeities to grace the court of the Egyptian deity: her kindred andmany-titled Bacchus, and the Cyprian Venus, a Grecian disguise forherself, rising from her bath, and the dog-headed Anubis, and the oxApis, and various Egyptian idols of uncouth form and unknownappellations.But we must not suppose that among the cities of Magna Graecia, Isis wasworshipped with those forms and ceremonies which were of right her own.The mongrel and modern nations of the South, with a mingled arroganceand ignorance, confounded the worships of all climes and ages.  And theprofound mysteries of the Nile were degraded by a hundred meretriciousand frivolous admixtures from the creeds of Cephisus and of Tibur.  Thetemple of Isis in Pompeii was served by Roman and Greek priests,ignorant alike of the language and the customs of her ancient votaries;and the descendant of the dread Egyptian kings, beneath the appearanceof reverential awe, secretly laughed to scorn the puny mummeries whichimitated the solemn and typical worship of his burning clime.Ranged now on either side the steps was the sacrificial crowd, arrayedin white garments, while at the summit stood two of the inferiorpriests, the one holding a palm branch, the other a slender sheaf ofcorn.  In the narrow passage in front thronged the bystanders.\'And what,\' whispered Arbaces to one of the bystanders, who was amerchant engaged in the Alexandrian trade, which trade had probablyfirst introduced in Pompeii the worship of the Egyptian goddess--\'whatoccasion now assembles you before the altars of the venerable Isis?  Itseems, by the white robes of the group before me, that a sacrifice is tobe rendered; and by the assembly of the priests, that ye are preparedfor some oracle.  To what question is it to vouchsafe a reply?\'\'We are merchants,\' replied the bystander (who was no other than Diomed)in the same voice, \'who seek to know the fate of our vessels, which sailfor Alexandria to-morrow.  We are about to offer up a sacrifice andimplore an answer from the goddess.  I am not one of those who havepetitioned the priest to sacrifice, as you may see by my dress, but Ihave some interest in the success of the fleet--by Jupiter! yes.  I havea pretty trade, else how could I live in these hard times?The Egyptian replied gravely--\'That though Isis was properly the goddessof agriculture, she was no less the patron of commerce.\' Then turninghis head towards the east, Arbaces seemed absorbed in silent prayer.And now in the centre of the steps appeared a priest robed in white fromhead to foot, the veil parting over the crown; two new priests relievedthose hitherto stationed at either corner, being naked half-way down tothe breast, and covered, for the rest, in white and loose robes.  At thesame time, seated at the bottom of the steps, a priest commenced asolemn air upon a long wind-instrument of music.  Half-way down thesteps stood another flamen, holding in one hand the votive wreath, inthe other a white wand; while, adding to the picturesque scene of thateastern ceremony, the stately ibis (bird sacred to the Egyptian worship)looked mutely down from the wall upon the rite, or stalked beside thealtar at the base of the steps.At that altar now stood the sacrificial flamen.The countenance of Arbaces seemed to lose all its rigid calm while thearuspices inspected the entrails, and to be intent in pious anxiety--torejoice and brighten as the signs were declared favorable, and the firebegan bright and clearly to consume the sacred portion of the victimamidst odorous of myrrh and frankincense.  It was then that a deadsilence fell over the whispering crowd, and the priests gathering roundthe cella, another priest, naked save by a cincture round the middle,rushed forward, and dancing with wild gestures, implored an answer fromthe goddess.  He ceased at last in exhaustion, and a low murmuring noisewas heard within the body of the statue: thrice the head moved, and thelips parted, and then a hollow voice uttered these mystic words:  There are waves like chargers that meet and glow,  There are graves ready wrought in the rocks below,  On the brow of the future the dangers lour,  But blest are your barks in the fearful hour.The voice ceased--the crowd breathed more freely--the merchants lookedat each other.  \'Nothing can be more plain,\' murmured Diomed; \'there isto be a storm at sea, as there very often is at the beginning of autumn,but our vessels are to be saved.  O beneficent Isis!\'\'Lauded eternally be the goddess!\' said the merchants: \'what can be lessequivocal than her prediction?\'Raising one hand in sign of silence to the people, for the rites of Isisenjoined what to the lively Pompeians was an impossible suspense fromthe use of the vocal organs, the chief priest poured his libation on thealtar, and after a short concluding prayer the ceremony was over, andthe congregation dismissed.  Still, however, as the crowd dispersedthemselves here and there, the Egyptian lingered by the railing, andwhen the space became tolerably cleared, one of the priests, approachingit, saluted him with great appearance of friendly familiarity.The countenance of the priest was remarkably unprepossessing--his shavenskull was so low and narrow in the front as nearly to approach to theconformation of that of an African savage, save only towards thetemples, where, in that organ styled acquisitiveness by the pupils of ascience modern in name, but best practically known (as their sculptureteaches us) amongst the ancients, two huge and almost preternaturalprotuberances yet more distorted the unshapely head--around the browsthe skin was puckered into a web of deep and intricate wrinkles--theeyes, dark and small, rolled in a muddy and yellow orbit--the nose,short yet coarse, was distended at the nostrils like a satyr\'s--and thethick but pallid lips, the high cheek-bones, the livid and motley huesthat struggled through the parchment skin, completed a countenance whichnone could behold without repugnance, and few without terror anddistrust: whatever the wishes of the mind, the animal frame was wellfitted to execute them; the wiry muscles of the throat, the broad chest,the nervous hands and lean gaunt arms, which were bared above the elbow,betokened a form capable alike of great active exertion and passiveendurance.\'Calenus,\' said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen, \'you haveimproved the voice of the statue much by attending to my suggestion; andyour verses are excellent.  Always prophesy good fortune, unless thereis an absolute impossibility of its fulfilment.\'\'Besides,\' added Calenus, \'if the storm does come, and if it doesoverwhelm the accursed ships, have we not prophesied it? and are thebarks not blest to be at rest?--for rest prays the mariner in the AEgeansea, or at least so says Horace--can the mariner be more at rest in thesea than when he is at the bottom of it?\'\'Right, my Calenus; I wish Apaecides would take a lesson from yourwisdom. But I desire to confer with you relative to him and to othermatters: you can admit me into one of your less sacred apartments?\'\'Assuredly,\' replied the priest, leading the way to one of the smallchambers which surrounded the open gate.  Here they seated themselvesbefore a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs, andvarious cold meats, with vases of excellent wine, of which while thecompanions partook, a curtain, drawn across the entrance opening to thecourt, concealed them from view, but admonished them by the thinness ofthe partition to speak low, or to speak no secrets: they chose theformer alternative.\'Thou knowest,\' said Arbaces, in a voice that scarcely stirred the air,so soft and inward was its sound, \'that it has ever been my maxim toattach myself to the young.  From their flexile and unformed minds I cancarve out my fittest tools.  I weave--I warp--I mould them at my will.Of the men I make merely followers or servants; of the women...\'\'Mistresses,\' said Calenus, as a livid grin distorted his ungainlyfeatures.\'Yes, I do not disguise it: woman is the main object, the greatappetite, of my soul.  As you feed the victim for the slaughter, I loveto rear the votaries of my pleasure.  I love to train, to ripen theirminds--to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions, in order toprepare the fruit to my taste.  I loathe your ready-made and ripenedcourtesans; it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence todesire that I find the true charm of love; it is thus that I defysatiety; and by contemplating the freshness of others, I sustain thefreshness of my own sensations.  From the young hearts of my victims Idraw the ingredients of the caldron in which I re-youth myself.  Butenough of this: to the subject before us.  You know, then, that inNeapolis some time since I encountered Ione and Apaecides, brother andsister, the children of Athenians who had settled at Neapolis. The deathof their parents, who knew and esteemed me, constituted me theirguardian.  I was not unmindful of the trust. The youth, docile and mild,yielded readily to the impression I sought to stamp upon him.  Next towoman, I love the old recollections of my ancestral land; I love to keepalive--to propagate on distant shores (which her colonies perchance yetpeople) her dark and mystic creeds.  It may be, that it pleases me todelude mankind, while I thus serve the deities.  To Apaecides I taughtthe solemn faith of Isis.  I unfolded to him something of those sublimeallegories which are couched beneath her worship.  I excited in a soulpeculiarly alive to religious fervor that enthusiasm which imaginationbegets on faith.  I have placed him amongst you: he is one of you.\'\'He is so,\' said Calenus: \'but in thus stimulating his faith, you haverobbed him of wisdom.  He is horror-struck that he is no longer duped:our sage delusions, our speaking statues and secret staircases dismayand revolt him; he pines; he wastes away; he mutters to himself; herefuses to share our ceremonies.  He has been known to frequent thecompany of men suspected of adherence to that new and atheistical creedwhich denies all our gods, and terms our oracles the inspirations ofthat malevolent spirit of which eastern tradition speaks.  Ouroracles--alas! we know well whose inspirations they are!\'\'This is what I feared,\' said Arbaces, musingly, \'from variousreproaches he made me when I last saw him.  Of late he hath shunned mysteps.  I must find him: I must continue my lessons: I must lead himinto the adytum of Wisdom. I must teach him that there are two stages ofsanctity--the first, FAITH--the next, DELUSION; the one for the vulgar,the second for the sage.\'\'I never passed through the first, I said Calenus; \'nor you either, Ithink, my Arbaces.\'\'You err,\' replied the Egyptian, gravely.  \'I believe at this day (notindeed that which I teach, but that which I teach not).  Nature has asanctity against which I cannot (nor would I) steel conviction.  Ibelieve in mine own knowledge, and that has revealed to me--but nomatter.  Now to earthlier and more inviting themes.  If I thus fulfilledmy object with Apaecides, what was my design for Ione?  Thou knowestalready I intend her for my queen--my bride--my heart\'s Isis.  Nevertill I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable.\'\'I hear from a thousand lips that she is a second Helen,\' said Calenus;and he smacked his own lips, but whether at the wine or at the notion itis not easy to decide.\'Yes, she has a beauty that Greece itself never excelled,\' resumedArbaces. \'But that is not all: she has a soul worthy to match with mine.She has a genius beyond that of woman--keen--dazzling--bold. Poetryflows spontaneous to her lips: utter but a truth, and, however intricateand profound, her mind seizes and commands it.  Her imagination and herreason are not at war with each other; they harmonize and direct hercourse as the winds and the waves direct some lofty bark.  With this sheunites a daring independence of thought; she can stand alone in theworld; she can be brave as she is gentle; this is the nature I havesought all my life in woman, and never found till now.  Ione must bemine!  In her I have a double passion; I wish to enjoy a beauty ofspirit as of form.\'\'She is not yours yet, then?\' said the priest.\'No; she loves me--but as a friend--she loves me with her mind only.She fancies in me the paltry virtues which I have only the profoundervirtue to disdain.  But you must pursue with me her history. The brotherand sister were young and rich: Ione is proud and ambitious--proud ofher genius--the magic of her poetry--the charm of her conversation.When her brother left me, and entered your temple, in order to be nearhim she removed also to Pompeii.  She has suffered her talents to beknown.  She summons crowds to her feasts; her voice enchants them; herpoetry subdues.  She delights in being thought the successor of Erinna.\'\'Or of Sappho?\'\'But Sappho without love!  I encouraged her in this boldness ofcareer--in this indulgence of vanity and of pleasure.  I loved to steepher amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city.  Mark me,Calenus!  I desired to enervate her mind!--it has been too pure toreceive yet the breath which I wish not to pass, but burningly to eatinto, the mirror.  I wished her to be surrounded by lovers, hollow,vain, and frivolous (lovers that her nature must despise), in order tofeel the want of love.  Then, in those soft intervals of lassitudethat succeed to excitement--I can weave my spells--excite herinterest--attract her passions--possess myself of her heart.  For it isnot the young, nor the beautiful, nor the gay, that should fascinateIone; her imagination must be won, and the life of Arbaces has been onescene of triumph over the imaginations of his kind.\'\'And hast thou no fear, then, of thy rivals?  The gallants of Italy areskilled in the art to please.\'\'None!  Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans, and would scornitself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race.\'\'But thou art an Egyptian, not a Greek!\'\'Egypt,\' replied Arbaces, \'is the mother of Athens.  Her tutelaryMinerva is our deity; and her founder, Cecrops, was the fugitive ofEgyptian Sais. This have I already taught to her; and in my blood shevenerates the eldest dynasties of earth.  But yet I will own that oflate some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind.  She is more silentthan she used to be; she loves melancholy and subduing music; she sighswithout an outward cause.  This may be the beginning of love--it may bethe want of love.  In either case it is time for me to begin myoperations on her fancies and her heart: in the one case, to divert thesource of love to me; in the other, in me to awaken it. It is for thisthat I have sought you.\'\'And how can I assist you?\'\'I am about to invite her to a feast in my house: I wish to dazzle--tobewilder--to inflame her senses.  Our arts--the arts by which Egypttrained her young novitiates--must be employed; and, under veil of themysteries of religion, I will open to her the secrets of love.\'\'Ah! now I understand:--one of those voluptuous banquets that, despiteour dull vows of mortified coldness, we, the priests of Isis, haveshared at thy house.\'\'No, no!  Thinkest thou her chaste eyes are ripe for such scenes? No;but first we must ensnare the brother--an easier task.  Listen to me,while I give you my instructions.\'Chapter VMORE OF THE FLOWER-GIRL.  THE PROGRESS OF LOVE.THE sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber in the house of Glaucus,which I have before said is now called the \'Room of Leda\'.  The morningrays entered through rows of small casements at the higher part of theroom, and through the door which opened on the garden, that answered tothe inhabitants of the southern cities the same purpose that agreenhouse or conservatory does to us.  The size of the garden did notadapt it for exercise, but the various and fragrant plants with which itwas filled gave a luxury to that indolence so dear to the dwellers in asunny clime.  And now the odorous, fanned by a gentle wind creeping fromthe adjacent sea, scattered themselves over that chamber, whose wallsvied with the richest colors of the most glowing flowers.  Besides thegem of the room--the painting of Leda and Tyndarus--in the centre ofeach compartment of the walls were set other pictures of exquisitebeauty.  In one you saw Cupid leaning on the knees of Venus; in anotherAriadne sleeping on the beach, unconscious of the perfidy of Theseus.Merrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and thebrilliant walls--far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart ofthe young Glaucus.\'I have seen her, then,\' said he, as he paced that narrow chamber--\'Ihave heard her--nay, I have spoken to her again--I have listened to themusic of her song, and she sung of glory and of Greece.  I havediscovered the long-sought idol of my dreams; and like the Cypriansculptor, I have breathed life into my own imaginings.\'Longer, perhaps, had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus, but atthat moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a youngfemale, still half a child in years, broke upon his solitude.  She wasdressed simply in a white tunic, which reached from the neck to theankles; under her arm she bore a basket of flowers, and in the otherhand she held a bronze water-vase; her features were more formed thanexactly became her years, yet they were soft and feminine in theiroutline, and without being beautiful in themselves, they were almostmade so by their beauty of expression; there was something ineffablygentle, and you would say patient, in her aspect.  A look of resignedsorrow, of tranquil endurance, had banished the smile, but not thesweetness, from her lips; something timid and cautious in herstep--something wandering in her eyes, led you to suspect the afflictionwhich she had suffered from her birth--she was blind; but in the orbsthemselves there was no visible defect--their melancholy and subduedlight was clear, cloudless, and serene. \'They tell me that Glaucus ishere,\' said she; \'may I come in?\'\'Ah, my Nydia,\' said the Greek, \'is that you I knew you would notneglect my invitation.\'\'Glaucus did but justice to himself,\' answered Nydia, with a blush; \'forhe has always been kind to the poor blind girl.\'\'Who could be otherwise?\' said Glaucus, tenderly, and in the voice of acompassionate brother.Nydia sighed and paused before she resumed, without replying to hisremark. \'You have but lately returned?\'\'This is the sixth sun that hath shone upon me at Pompeii.\'\'And you are well?  Ah, I need not ask--for who that sees the earth,which they tell me is so beautiful, can be ill?\'\'I am well.  And you, Nydia--how you have grown!  Next year you will bethinking what answer to make your lovers.\'A second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia, but this time she frownedas she blushed.  \'I have brought you some flowers,\' said she, withoutreplying to a remark that she seemed to resent; and feeling about theroom till she found the table that stood by Glaucus, she laid the basketupon it: \'they are poor, but they are fresh-gathered.\'\'They might come from Flora herself,\' said he, kindly; \'and I renewagain my vow to the Graces, that I will wear no other garlands while thyhands can weave me such as these.\'\'And how find you the flowers in your viridarium?--are they thriving?\'\'Wonderfully so--the Lares themselves must have tended them.\'\'Ah, now you give me pleasure; for I came, as often as I could steal theleisure, to water and tend them in your absence.\'\'How shall I thank thee, fair Nydia?\' said the Greek.  \'Glaucus littledreamed that he left one memory so watchful over his favorites atPompeii.\'The hand of the child trembled, and her breast heaved beneath her tunic.She turned round in embarrassment.  \'The sun is hot for the poorflowers,\' said she, \'to-day and they will miss me; for I have been illlately, and it is nine days since I visited them.\'\'Ill, Nydia!--yet your cheek has more color than it had last year.\'\'I am often ailing,\' said the blind girl, touchingly; \'and as I grow upI grieve more that I am blind.  But now to the flowers!\' So saying, shemade a slight reverence with her head, and passing into the viridarium,busied herself with watering the flowers.\'Poor Nydia,\' thought Glaucus, gazing on her; \'thine is a hard doom!Thou seest not the earth--nor the sun--nor the ocean--nor thestars--above all, thou canst not behold Ione.\'At that last thought his mind flew back to the past evening, and was asecond time disturbed in its reveries by the entrance of Clodius.  Itwas a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and torefine the love of the Athenian for Ione, that whereas he had confidedto Clodius the secret of his first interview with her, and the effect ithad produced on him, he now felt an invincible aversion even to mentionto him her name.  He had seen Ione, bright, pure, unsullied, in themidst of the gayest and most profligate gallants of Pompeii, charmingrather than awing the boldest into respect, and changing the very natureof the most sensual and the least ideal--as by her intellectual andrefining spells she reversed the fable of Circe, and converted theanimals into men.  They who could not understand her soul were madespiritual, as it were, by the magic of her beauty--they who had no heartfor poetry had ears, at least, for the melody of her voice. Seeing herthus surrounded, purifying and brightening all things with her presence,Glaucus almost for the first time felt the nobleness of his ownnature--he felt how unworthy of the goddess of his dreams had been hiscompanions and his pursuits.  A veil seemed lifted from his eyes; he sawthat immeasurable distance between himself and his associates which thedeceiving mists of pleasure had hitherto concealed; he was refined by asense of his courage in aspiring to Ione.  He felt that henceforth itwas his destiny to look upward and to soar.  He could no longer breathethat name, which sounded to the sense of his ardent fancy as somethingsacred and divine, to lewd and vulgar ears.  She was no longer thebeautiful girl once seen and passionately remembered--she was alreadythe mistress, the divinity of his soul.  This feeling who has notexperienced?--If thou hast not, then thou hast never loved.When Clodius therefore spoke to him in affected transport of the beautyof Ione, Glaucus felt only resentment and disgust that such lips shoulddare to praise her; he answered coldly, and the Roman imagined that hispassion was cured instead of heightened.  Clodius scarcely regretted it,for he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richlyendowed--Julia, the daughter of the wealthy Diomed, whose gold thegamester imagined he could readily divert into his own coffers.  Theirconversation did not flow with its usual ease; and no sooner had Clodiusleft him than Glaucus bent his way to the house of Ione.  In passing bythe threshold he again encountered Nydia, who had finished her gracefultask.  She knew his step on the instant.\'You are early abroad?\' said she.\'Yes; for the skies of Campania rebuke the sluggard who neglects them.\'\'Ah, would I could see them!\' murmured the blind girl, but so low thatGlaucus did not overhear the complaint.The Thessalian lingered on the threshold a few moments, and then guidingher steps by a long staff, which she used with great dexterity, she tookher way homeward.  She soon turned from the more gaudy streets, andentered a quarter of the town but little loved by the decorous and thesober.  But from the low and rude evidences of vice around her she wassaved by her misfortune.  And at that hour the streets were quiet andsilent, nor was her youthful ear shocked by the sounds which too oftenbroke along the obscene and obscure haunts she patiently and sadlytraversed.She knocked at the back-door of a sort of tavern; it opened, and a rudevoice bade her give an account of the sesterces.  Ere she could reply,another voice, less vulgarly accented, said:\'Never mind those petty profits, my Burbo.  The girl\'s voice will bewanted again soon at our rich friend\'s revels; and he pays, as thouknowest, pretty high for his nightingales\' tongues.\'Oh, I hope not--I trust not,\' cried Nydia, trembling.  \'I will beg fromsunrise to sunset, but send me not there.\'\'And why?\' asked the same voice.\'Because--because I am young, and delicately born, and the femalecompanions I meet there are not fit associates for one who--who...\'\'Is a slave in the house of Burbo,\' returned the voice ironically, andwith a coarse laugh.The Thessalian put down the flowers, and, leaning her face on her hands,wept silently.Meanwhile, Glaucus sought the house of the beautiful Neapolitan. Hefound Ione sitting amidst her attendants, who were at work around her.Her harp stood at her side, for Ione herself was unusually idle, perhapsunusually thoughtful, that day.  He thought her even more beautiful bythe morning light and in her simple robe, than amidst the blazing lamps,and decorated with the costly jewels of the previous night: not the lessso from a certain paleness that overspread her transparent hues--not theless so from the blush that mounted over them when he approached.Accustomed to flatter, flattery died upon his lips when he addressedIone.  He felt it beneath her to utter the homage which every lookconveyed.  They spoke of Greece; this was a theme on which Ione lovedrather to listen than to converse: it was a theme on which the Greekcould have been eloquent for ever.  He described to her the silver olivegroves that yet clad the banks of Ilyssus, and the temples, alreadydespoiled of half their glories--but how beautiful in decay!  He lookedback on the melancholy city of Harmodius the free, and Pericles themagnificent, from the height of that distant memory, which mellowed intoone hazy light all the ruder and darker shades.  He had seen the land ofpoetry chiefly in the poetical age of early youth; and the associationsof patriotism were blended with those of the flush and spring of life.And Ione listened to him, absorbed and mute; dearer were those accents,and those descriptions, than all the prodigal adulation of hernumberless adorers.  Was it a sin to love her countryman? she lovedAthens in him--the gods of her race, the land of her dreams, spoke toher in his voice!  From that time they daily saw each other.  At thecool of the evening they made excursions on the placid sea.  By nightthey met again in Ione\'s porticoes and halls.  Their love was sudden,but it was strong; it filled all the sources of their life.Heart--brain--sense--imagination, all were its ministers and priests.As you take some obstacle from two objects that have a mutualattraction, they met, and united at once; their wonder was, that theyhad lived separate so long.  And it was natural that they should solove.  Young, beautiful, and gifted--of the same birth, and the samesoul--there was poetry in their very union.  They imagined the heavenssmiled upon their affection.  As the persecuted seek refuge at theshrine, so they recognized in the altar of their love an asylum from thesorrows of earth; they covered it with flowers--they knew not of theserpents that lay coiled behind.One evening, the fifth after their first meeting at Pompeii, Glaucus andIone, with a small party of chosen friends, were returning from anexcursion round the bay; their vessel skimmed lightly over the twilightwaters, whose lucid mirror was only broken by the dripping oars.  As therest of the party conversed gaily with each other, Glaucus lay at thefeet of Ione, and he would have looked up in her face, but he did notdare.  Ione broke the pause between them.\'My poor brother,\' said she, sighing, \'how once he would have enjoyedthis hour!\'\'Your brother!\' said Glaucus; \'I have not seen him.  Occupied with you,I have thought of nothing else, or I should have asked if that was notyour brother for whose companionship you left me at the Temple ofMinerva, in Neapolis?\'\'It was.\'\'And is he here?\'\'He is.\'At Pompeii! and not constantly with you?  Impossible!\'\'He has other duties,\' answered Ione, sadly; \'he is a priest of Isis.\'\'So young, too; and that priesthood, in its laws at least, so severe!\'said the warm and bright-hearted Greek, in surprise and pity. \'Whatcould have been his inducement?\'\'He was always enthusiastic and fervent in religious devotion: and theeloquence of an Egyptian--our friend and guardian--kindled in him thepious desire to consecrate his life to the most mystic of our deities.Perhaps in the intenseness of his zeal, he found in the severity of thatpeculiar priesthood its peculiar attraction.\'\'And he does not repent his choice?--I trust he is happy.\'Ione sighed deeply, and lowered her veil over her eyes.\'I wish,\' said she, after a pause, \'that he had not been so hasty.Perhaps, like all who expect too much, he is revolted too easily!\'\'Then he is not happy in his new condition.  And this Egyptian, was he apriest himself? was he interested in recruits to the sacred band?\'No.  His main interest was in our happiness.  He thought he promotedthat of my brother.  We were left orphans.\'\'Like myself,\' said Glaucus, with a deep meaning in his voice.Ione cast down her eyes as she resumed:\'And Arbaces sought to supply the place of our parent.  You must knowhim. He loves genius.\'\'Arbaces! I know him already; at least, we speak when we meet.  But foryour praise I would not seek to know more of him.  My heart inclinesreadily to most of my kind.  But that dark Egyptian, with his gloomybrow and icy smiles, seems to me to sadden the very sun. One would thinkthat, like Epimenides, the Cretan, he had spent forty years in a cave,and had found something unnatural in the daylight ever afterwards.\'\'Yet, like Epimenides, he is kind, and wise, and gentle,\' answered Ione.\'Oh, happy that he has thy praise!  He needs no other virtues to makehim dear to me.\'\'His calm, his coldness,\' said Ione, evasively pursuing the subject,\'are perhaps but the exhaustion of past sufferings; as yonder mountain(and she pointed to Vesuvius), which we see dark and tranquil in thedistance, once nursed the fires for ever quenched.\'They both gazed on the mountain as Ione said these words; the rest ofthe sky was bathed in rosy and tender hues, but over that grey summit,rising amidst the woods and vineyards that then clomb half-way up theascent, there hung a black and ominous cloud, the single frown of thelandscape.  A sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each as they thusgazed; and in that sympathy which love had already taught them, andwhich bade them, in the slightest shadows of emotion, the faintestpresentiment of evil, turn for refuge to each other, their gaze at thesame moment left the mountain, and full of unimaginable tenderness, met.What need had they of words to say they loved?Chapter VITHE FOWLER SNARES AGAIN THE BIRD THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED, AND SETS HISNETS FOR A NEW VICTIM.IN the history I relate, the events are crowded and rapid as those ofthe drama.  I write of an epoch in which days sufficed to ripen theordinary fruits of years.Meanwhile, Arbaces had not of late much frequented the house of Ione;and when he had visited her he had not encountered Glaucus, nor knew he,as yet, of that love which had so suddenly sprung up between himself andhis designs.  In his interest for the brother of Ione, he had beenforced, too, a little while, to suspend his interest in Ione herself.His pride and his selfishness were aroused and alarmed at the suddenchange which had come over the spirit of the youth.  He trembled lest hehimself should lose a docile pupil, and Isis an enthusiastic servant.Apaecides had ceased to seek or to consult him.  He was rarely to befound; he turned sullenly from the Egyptian--nay, he fled when heperceived him in the distance. Arbaces was one of those haughty andpowerful spirits accustomed to master others; he chafed at the notionthat one once his own should ever elude his grasp. He swore inly thatApaecides should not escape him.It was with this resolution that he passed through a thick grove in thecity, which lay between his house and that of Ione, in his way to thelatter; and there, leaning against a tree, and gazing on the ground, hecame unawares on the young priest of Isis.\'Apaecides!\' said he--and he laid his hand affectionately on the youngman\'s shoulder.The priest started; and his first instinct seemed to be that of flight.\'My son,\' said the Egyptian, \'what has chanced that you desire to shunme?\'Apaecides remained silent and sullen, looking down on the earth, as hislips quivered, and his breast heaved with emotion.\'Speak to me, my friend,\' continued the Egyptian.  \'Speak. Somethingburdens thy spirit.  What hast thou to reveal?\'\'To thee--nothing.\'\'And why is it to me thou art thus unconfidential?\'\'Because thou hast been my enemy.\'\'Let us confer,\' said Arbaces, in a low voice; and drawing the reluctantarm of the priest in his own, he led him to one of the seats which werescattered within the grove.  They sat down--and in those gloomy formsthere was something congenial to the shade and solitude of the place.Apaecides was in the spring of his years, yet he seemed to haveexhausted even more of life than the Egyptian; his delicate and regularfeatures were worn and colorless; his eyes were hollow, and shone with abrilliant and feverish glare: his frame bowed prematurely, and in hishands, which were small to effeminacy, the blue and swollen veinsindicated the lassitude and weakness of the relaxed fibres.  You saw inhis face a strong resemblance to Ione, but the expression was altogetherdifferent from that majestic and spiritual calm which breathed so divineand classical a repose over his sister\'s beauty.  In her, enthusiasm wasvisible, but it seemed always suppressed and restrained; this made thecharm and sentiment of her countenance; you longed to awaken a spiritwhich reposed, but evidently did not sleep.  In Apaecides the wholeaspect betokened the fervor and passion of his temperament, and theintellectual portion of his nature seemed, by the wild fire of the eyes,the great breadth of the temples when compared with the height of thebrow, the trembling restlessness of the lips, to be swayed andtyrannized over by the imaginative and ideal.  Fancy, with the sister,had stopped short at the golden goal of poetry; with the brother, lesshappy and less restrained, it had wandered into visions more intangibleand unembodied; and the faculties which gave genius to the onethreatened madness to the other.\'You say I have been your enemy,\' said Arbaces, \'I know the cause ofthat unjust accusation: I have placed you amidst the priests ofIsis--you are revolted at their trickeries and imposture--you think thatI too have deceived you--the purity of your mind is offended--youimagine that I am one of the deceitful...\'\'You knew the jugglings of that impious craft,\' answered Apaecides; \'whydid you disguise them from me?--When you excited my desire to devotemyself to the office whose garb I bear, you spoke to me of the holy lifeof men resigning themselves to knowledge--you have given me forcompanions an ignorant and sensual herd, who have no knowledge but thatof the grossest frauds; you spoke to me of men sacrificing the earthlierpleasures to the sublime cultivation of virtue--you place me amongst menreeking with all the filthiness of vice; you spoke to me of the friends,the enlighteners of our common kind--I see but their cheats anddeluders!  Oh!  it was basely done!--you have robbed me of the glory ofyouth, of the convictions of virtue, of the sanctifying thirst afterwisdom.  Young as I was, rich, fervent, the sunny pleasures of earthbefore me, I resigned all without a sign, nay, with happiness andexultation, in the thought that I resigned them for the abstrusemysteries of diviner wisdom, for the companionship of gods--for therevelations of Heaven--and now--now...\'Convulsive sobs checked the priest\'s voice; he covered his face with hishands, and large tears forced themselves through the wasted fingers, andran profusely down his vest.\'What I promised to thee, that will I give, my friend, my pupil: thesehave been but trials to thy virtue--it comes forth the brighter for thynovitiate--think no more of those dull cheats--assort no more with thosemenials of the goddess, the atrienses of her hall--you are worthy toenter into the penetralia.  I henceforth will be your priest, yourguide, and you who now curse my friendship shall live to bless it.\'The young man lifted up his head, and gazed with a vacant and wonderingstare upon the Egyptian.\'Listen to me,\' continued Arbaces, in an earnest and solemn voice,casting first his searching eyes around to see that they were stillalone.  \'From Egypt came all the knowledge of the world; from Egypt camethe lore of Athens, and the profound policy of Crete; from Egypt camethose early and mysterious tribes which (long before the hordes ofRomulus swept over the plains of Italy, and in the eternal cycle ofevents drove back civilization into barbarism and darkness) possessedall the arts of wisdom and the graces of intellectual life.  From Egyptcame the rites and the grandeur of that solemn Caere, whose inhabitantstaught their iron vanquishers of Rome all that they yet know of elevatedin religion and sublime in worship.  And how deemest thou, young man,that that Egypt, the mother of countless nations, achieved hergreatness, and soared to her cloud-capt eminence of wisdom?--It was theresult of a profound and holy policy.  Your modern nations owe theirgreatness to Egypt--Egypt her greatness to her priests.  Rapt inthemselves, coveting a sway over the nobler part of man, his soul andhis belief, those ancient ministers of God were inspired with thegrandest thought that ever exalted mortals.  From the revolutions of thestars, from the seasons of the earth, from the round and unvaryingcircle of human destinies, they devised an august allegory; they made itgross and palpable to the vulgar by the signs of gods and goddesses, andthat which in reality was Government they named Religion.  Isis is afable--start not!--that for which Isis is a type is a reality, animmortal being; Isis is nothing.  Nature, which she represents, is themother of all things--dark, ancient, inscrutable, save to the giftedfew.  ""None among mortals hath ever lifted up my veil,"" so saith theIsis that you adore; but to the wise that veil hath been removed, and wehave stood face to face with the solemn loveliness of Nature.  Thepriests then were the benefactors, the civilizers of mankind; true, theywere also cheats, impostors if you will.  But think you, young man, thatif they had not deceived their kind they could have served them?  Theignorant and servile vulgar must be blinded to attain to their propergood; they would not believe a maxim--they revere an oracle.  TheEmperor of Rome sways the vast and various tribes of earth, andharmonizes the conflicting and disunited elements; thence come peace,order, law, the blessings of life. Think you it is the man, the emperor,that thus sways?--no, it is the pomp, the awe, the majesty that surroundhim--these are his impostures, his delusions; our oracles and ourdivinations, our rites and our ceremonies, are the means of oursovereignty and the engines of our power.  They are the same means tothe same end, the welfare and harmony of mankind.  You listen to me raptand intent--the light begins to dawn upon you.\'Apaecides remained silent, but the changes rapidly passing over hisspeaking countenance betrayed the effect produced upon him by the wordsof the Egyptian--words made tenfold more eloquent by the voice, theaspect, and the manner of the man.\'While, then,\' resumed Arbaces, \'our fathers of the Nile thus achievedthe first elements by whose life chaos is destroyed, namely, theobedience and reverence of the multitude for the few, they drew fromtheir majestic and starred meditations that wisdom which was nodelusion: they invented the codes and regularities of law--the arts andglories of existence.  They asked belief; they returned the gift bycivilization.  Were not their very cheats a virtue!  Trust me, whosoeverin yon far heavens of a diviner and more beneficent nature look downupon our world, smile approvingly on the wisdom which has worked suchends.  But you wish me to apply these generalities to yourself; I hastento obey the wish.  The altars of the goddess of our ancient faith mustbe served, and served too by others than the stolid and soulless thingsthat are but as pegs and hooks whereon to hang the fillet and the robe.Remember two sayings of Sextus the Pythagorean, sayings borrowed fromthe lore of Egypt.  The first is, ""Speak not of God to the multitude"";the second is, ""The man worthy of God is a god among men."" As Geniusgave to the ministers of Egypt worship, that empire in late ages sofearfully decayed, thus by Genius only can the dominion be restored.  Isaw in you, Apaecides, a pupil worthy of my lessons--a minister worthyof the great ends which may yet be wrought; your energy, your talents,your purity of faith, your earnestness of enthusiasm, all fitted you forthat calling which demands so imperiously high and ardent qualities: Ifanned, therefore, your sacred desires; I stimulated you to the step youhave taken. But you blame me that I did not reveal to you the littlesouls and the juggling tricks of your companions.  Had I done so,Apaecides, I had defeated my own object; your noble nature would have atonce revolted, and Isis would have lost her priest.\'Apaecides groaned aloud.  The Egyptian continued, without heeding theinterruption.\'I placed you, therefore, without preparation, in the temple; I left yousuddenly to discover and to be sickened by all those mummeries whichdazzle the herd.  I desired that you should perceive how those enginesare moved by which the fountain that refreshes the world casts itswaters in the air.  It was the trial ordained of old to all our priests.They who accustom themselves to the impostures of the vulgar, are leftto practise them--for those like you, whose higher natures demand higherpursuit, religion opens more god-like secrets.  I am pleased to find inyou the character I had expected.  You have taken the vows; you cannotrecede.  Advance--I will be your guide.\'\'And what wilt thou teach me, O singular and fearful man?  Newcheats--new...\'\'No--I have thrown thee into the abyss of disbelief; I will lead theenow to the eminence of faith.  Thou hast seen the false types: thoushalt learn now the realities they represent.  There is no shadow,Apaecides, without its substance.  Come to me this night.  Your hand.\'Impressed, excited, bewildered by the language of the Egyptian,Apaecides gave him his hand, and master and pupil parted.It was true that for Apaecides there was no retreat.  He had taken thevows of celibacy: he had devoted himself to a life that at presentseemed to possess all the austerities of fanaticism, without any of theconsolations of belief It was natural that he should yet cling to ayearning desire to reconcile himself to an irrevocable career.  Thepowerful and profound mind of the Egyptian yet claimed an empire overhis young imagination; excited him with vague conjecture, and kept himalternately vibrating between hope and fear.Meanwhile Arbaces pursued his slow and stately way to the house of Ione.As he entered the tablinum, he heard a voice from the porticoes of theperistyle beyond, which, musical as it was, sounded displeasingly on hisear--it was the voice of the young and beautiful Glaucus, and for thefirst time an involuntary thrill of jealousy shot through the breast ofthe Egyptian.  On entering the peristyle, he found Glaucus seated by theside of Ione.  The fountain in the odorous garden cast up its silverspray in the air, and kept a delicious coolness in the midst of thesultry noon.  The handmaids, almost invariably attendant on Ione, whowith her freedom of life preserved the most delicate modesty, sat at alittle distance; by the feet of Glaucus lay the lyre on which he hadbeen playing to Ione one of the Lesbian airs.  The scene--the groupbefore Arbaces, was stamped by that peculiar and refined ideality ofpoesy which we yet, not erroneously, imagine to be the distinction ofthe ancients--the marble columns, the vases of flowers, the statue,white and tranquil, closing every vista; and, above all, the two livingforms, from which a sculptor might have caught either inspiration ordespair!Arbaces, pausing for a moment, gazed on the pair with a brow from whichall the usual stern serenity had fled; he recovered himself by aneffort, and slowly approached them, but with a step so soft andecholess, that even the attendants heard him not; much less Ione and herlover.\'And yet,\' said Glaucus, \'it is only before we love that we imagine thatour poets have truly described the passion; the instant the sun rises,all the stars that had shone in his absence vanish into air.  The poetsexist only in the night of the heart; they are nothing to us when wefeel the full glory of the god.\'\'A gentle and most glowing image, noble Glaucus.\'Both started, and recognized behind the seat of Ione the cold andsarcastic face of the Egyptian.\'You are a sudden guest,\' said Glaucus, rising, and with a forced smile.\'So ought all to be who know they are welcome,\' returned Arbaces,seating himself, and motioning to Glaucus to do the same.\'I am glad,\' said Ione, \'to see you at length together; for you aresuited to each other, and you are formed to be friends.\'\'Give me back some fifteen years of life,\' replied the Egyptian, \'beforeyou can place me on an equality with Glaucus.  Happy should I be toreceive his friendship; but what can I give him in return?  Can I maketo him the same confidences that he would repose in me--of banquets andgarlands--of Parthian steeds, and the chances of the dice? thesepleasures suit his age, his nature, his career: they are not for mine.\'So saying, the artful Egyptian looked down and sighed; but from thecorner of his eye he stole a glance towards Ione, to see how shereceived these insinuations of the pursuits of her visitor.  Hercountenance did not satisfy him.  Glaucus, slightly coloring, hastenedgaily to reply.  Nor was he, perhaps, without the wish in his turn todisconcert and abash the Egyptian.\'You are right, wise Arbaces,\' said he; \'we can esteem each other, butwe cannot be friends.  My banquets lack the secret salt which, accordingto rumor, gives such zest to your own.  And, by Hercules! when I havereached your age, if I, like you, may think it wise to pursue thepleasures of manhood, like you, I shall be doubtless sarcastic on thegallantries of youth.\'The Egyptian raised his eyes to Glaucus with a sudden and piercingglance.\'I do not understand you,\' said he, coldly; \'but it is the custom toconsider that wit lies in obscurity.\' He turned from Glaucus as hespoke, with a scarcely perceptible sneer of contempt, and after amoment\'s pause addressed himself to Ione.\'I have not, beautiful Ione,\' said he, \'been fortunate enough to findyou within doors the last two or three times that I have visited yourvestibule.\'\'The smoothness of the sea has tempted me much from home,\' replied Ione,with a little embarrassment.The embarrassment did not escape Arbaces; but without seeming to heedit, he replied with a smile: \'You know the old poet says, that ""Womenshould keep within doors, and there converse.""\'\'The poet was a cynic,\' said Glaucus, \'and hated women.\'\'He spoke according to the customs of his country, and that country isyour boasted Greece.\'\'To different periods different customs.  Had our forefathers knownIone, they had made a different law.\'\'Did you learn these pretty gallantries at Rome?\' said Arbaces, withill-suppressed emotion.\'One certainly would not go for gallantries to Egypt,\' retorted Glaucus,playing carelessly with his chain.\'Come, come,\' said Ione, hastening to interrupt a conversation which shesaw, to her great distress, was so little likely to cement the intimacyshe had desired to effect between Glaucus and her friend, \'Arbaces mustnot be so hard upon his poor pupil.  An orphan, and without a mother\'scare, I may be to blame for the independent and almost masculine libertyof life that I have chosen: yet it is not greater than the Roman womenare accustomed to--it is not greater than the Grecian ought to be.Alas! is it only to be among men that freedom and virtue are to bedeemed united?  Why should the slavery that destroys you be consideredthe only method to preserve us?  Ah! believe me, it has been the greaterror of men--and one that has worked bitterly on their destinies--toimagine that the nature of women is (I will not say inferior, that maybe so, but) so different from their own, in making laws unfavorable tothe intellectual advancement of women.  Have they not, in so doing, madelaws against their children, whom women are to rear?--against thehusbands, of whom women are to be the friends, nay, sometimes theadvisers?\' Ione stopped short suddenly, and her face was suffused withthe most enchanting blushes.  She feared lest her enthusiasm had led hertoo far; yet she feared the austere Arbaces less than the courteousGlaucus, for she loved the last, and it was not the custom of the Greeksto allow their women (at least such of their women as they most honored)the same liberty and the same station as those of Italy enjoyed. Shefelt, therefore, a thrill of delight as Glaucus earnestly replied:\'Ever mayst thou think thus, Ione--ever be your pure heart your unerringguide!  Happy it had been for Greece if she had given to the chaste thesame intellectual charms that are so celebrated amongst the less worthyof her women.  No state falls from freedom--from knowledge, while yoursex smile only on the free, and by appreciating, encourage the wise.\'Arbaces was silent, for it was neither his part to sanction thesentiment of Glaucus, nor to condemn that of Ione, and, after a shortand embarrassed conversation, Glaucus took his leave of Ione.When he was gone, Arbaces, drawing his seat nearer to the fairNeapolitan\'s, said in those bland and subdued tones, in which he knew sowell how to veil the mingled art and fierceness of his character:\'Think not, my sweet pupil, if so I may call you, that I wish to shacklethat liberty you adorn while you assume: but which, if not greater, asyou rightly observe, than that possessed by the Roman women, must atleast be accompanied by great circumspection, when arrogated by oneunmarried. Continue to draw crowds of the gay, the brilliant, the wisethemselves, to your feet--continue to charm them with the conversationof an Aspasia, the music of an Erinna--but reflect, at least, on thosecensorious tongues which can so easily blight the tender reputation of amaiden; and while you provoke admiration, give, I beseech you, novictory to envy.\'\'What mean you, Arbaces?\' said Ione, in an alarmed and trembling voice:\'I know you are my friend, that you desire only my honour and mywelfare.  What is it you would say?\'\'Your friend--ah, how sincerely!  May I speak then as a friend, withoutreserve and without offence?\'\'I beseech you do so.\'\'This young profligate, this Glaucus, how didst thou know him? Hast thouseen him often?\' And as Arbaces spoke, he fixed his gaze steadfastlyupon Ione, as if he sought to penetrate into her soul.Recoiling before that gaze, with a strange fear which she could notexplain, the Neapolitan answered with confusion and hesitation: \'He wasbrought to my house as a countryman of my father\'s, and I may say ofmine.  I have known him only within this last week or so: but why thesequestions?\'\'Forgive me,\' said Arbaces; \'I thought you might have known him longer.Base insinuator that he is!\'\'How! what mean you?  Why that term?\'\'It matters not: let me not rouse your indignation against one who doesnot deserve so grave an honour.\'\'I implore you speak.  What has Glaucus insinuated? or rather, in whatdo you suppose he has offended?\'Smothering his resentment at the last part of Ione\'s question, Arbacescontinued: \'You know his pursuits, his companions his habits; thecomissatio and the alea (the revel and the dice) make his occupation;and amongst the associates of vice how can he dream of virtue?\'\'Still you speak riddles.  By the gods!  I entreat you, say the worst atonce.\'\'Well, then, it must be so.  Know, my Ione, that it was but yesterdaythat Glaucus boasted openly--yes, in the public baths--of your love tohim.  He said it amused him to take advantage of it. Nay, I will do himjustice, he praised your beauty.  Who could deny it? But he laughedscornfully when his Clodius, or his Lepidus, asked him if he loved youenough for marriage, and when he purposed to adorn his door-posts withflowers?\'\'Impossible!  How heard you this base slander?\'\'Nay, would you have me relate to you all the comments of the insolentcoxcombs with which the story has circled through the town? Be assuredthat I myself disbelieved at first, and that I have now painfully beenconvinced by several ear-witnesses of the truth of what I havereluctantly told thee.\'Ione sank back, and her face was whiter than the pillar against whichshe leaned for support.\'I own it vexed--it irritated me, to hear your name thus lightly pitchedfrom lip to lip, like some mere dancing-girl\'s fame.  I hastened thismorning to seek and to warn you.  I found Glaucus here.  I was stungfrom my self-possession.  I could not conceal my feelings; nay, I wasuncourteous in thy presence.  Canst thou forgive thy friend, Ione?\'Ione placed her hand in his, but replied not.\'Think no more of this,\' said he; \'but let it be a warning voice, totell thee how much prudence thy lot requires.  It cannot hurt thee,Ione, for a moment; for a gay thing like this could never have beenhonored by even a serious thought from Ione.  These insults only woundwhen they come from one we love; far different indeed is he whom thelofty Ione shall stoop to love.\'\'Love!\' muttered Ione, with an hysterical laugh.  \'Ay, indeed.\'It is not without interest to observe in those remote times, and under asocial system so widely different from the modern, the same small causesthat ruffle and interrupt the \'course of love\', which operate socommonly at this day--the same inventive jealousy, the same cunningslander, the same crafty and fabricated retailings of petty gossip,which so often now suffice to break the ties of the truest love, andcounteract the tenor of circumstances most apparently propitious.  Whenthe bark sails on over the smoothest wave, the fable tells us of thediminutive fish that can cling to the keel and arrest its progress: sois it ever with the great passions of mankind; and we should paint lifebut ill if, even in times the most prodigal of romance, and of theromance of which we most largely avail ourselves, we did not alsodescribe the mechanism of those trivial and household springs ofmischief which we see every day at work in our chambers and at ourhearths.  It is in these, the lesser intrigues of life, that we mostlyfind ourselves at home with the past.Most cunningly had the Egyptian appealed to Ione\'s ruling foible--mostdexterously had he applied the poisoned dart to her pride.  He fanciedhe had arrested what he hoped, from the shortness of the time she hadknown Glaucus, was, at most, but an incipient fancy; and hastening tochange the subject, he now led her to talk of her brother.  Theirconversation did not last long.  He left her, resolved not again totrust so much to absence, but to visit--to watch her--every day.No sooner had his shadow glided from her presence, than woman\'spride--her sex\'s dissimulation--deserted his intended victim, and thehaughty Ione burst into passionate tears.Chapter VIITHE GAY LIFE OF THE POMPEIAN LOUNGER.  A MINIATURE LIKENESS OF THE ROMANBATHS.WHEN Glaucus left Ione, he felt as if he trod upon air.  In theinterview with which he had just been blessed, he had for the first timegathered from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome to, andwould not be unrewarded by, her.  This hope filled him with a rapturefor which earth and heaven seemed too narrow to afford a vent.Unconscious of the sudden enemy he had left behind, and forgetting notonly his taunts but his very existence, Glaucus passed through the gaystreets, repeating to himself, in the wantonness of joy, the music ofthe soft air to which Ione had listened with such intentness; and now heentered the Street of Fortune, with its raised footpath--its housespainted without, and the open doors admitting the view of the glowingfrescoes within.  Each end of the street was adorned with a triumphalarch: and as Glaucus now came before the Temple of Fortune, the juttingportico of that beautiful fane (which is supposed to have been built byone of the family of Cicero, perhaps by the orator himself) imparted adignified and venerable feature to a scene otherwise more brilliant thanlofty in its character.  That temple was one of the most gracefulspecimens of Roman architecture. It was raised on a somewhat loftypodium; and between two flights of steps ascending to a platform stoodthe altar of the goddess.  From this platform another flight of broadstairs led to the portico, from the height of whose fluted columns hungfestoons of the richest flowers.  On either side the extremities of thetemple were placed statues of Grecian workmanship; and at a littledistance from the temple rose the triumphal arch crowned with anequestrian statue of Caligula, which was flanked by trophies of bronze.In the space before the temple a lively throng were assembled--someseated on benches and discussing the politics of the empire, someconversing on the approaching spectacle of the amphitheatre.  One knotof young men were lauding a new beauty, another discussing the merits ofthe last play; a third group, more stricken in age, were speculating onthe chance of the trade with Alexandria, and amidst these were manymerchants in the Eastern costume, whose loose and peculiar robes,painted and gemmed slippers, and composed and serious countenances,formed a striking contrast to the tunicked forms and animated gesturesof the Italians.  For that impatient and lively people had, as now, alanguage distinct from speech--a language of signs and motions,inexpressibly significant and vivacious: their descendants retain it,and the learned Jorio hath written a most entertaining work upon thatspecies of hieroglyphical gesticulation.Sauntering through the crowd, Glaucus soon found himself amidst a groupof his merry and dissipated friends.\'Ah!\' said Sallust, \'it is a lustrum since I saw you.\'\'And how have you spent the lustrum?  What new dishes have youdiscovered?\'\'I have been scientific,\' returned Sallust, \'and have made someexperiments in the feeding of lampreys: I confess I despair of bringingthem to the perfection which our Roman ancestors attained.\'\'Miserable man! and why?\'\'Because,\' returned Sallust, with a sigh, \'it is no longer lawful togive them a slave to eat.  I am very often tempted to make away with avery fat carptor (butler) whom I possess, and pop him slily into thereservoir.  He would give the fish a most oleaginous flavor!  But slavesare not slaves nowadays, and have no sympathy with their masters\'interest--or Davus would destroy himself to oblige me!\'\'What news from Rome?\' said Lepidus, as he languidly joined the group.\'The emperor has been giving a splendid supper to the senators,\'answered Sallust.\'He is a good creature,\' quoth Lepidus; \'they say he never sends a manaway without granting his request.\'\'Perhaps he would let me kill a slave for my reservoir?\' returnedSallust, eagerly.\'Not unlikely,\' said Glaucus; \'for he who grants a favor to one Roman,must always do it at the expense of another.  Be sure, that for everysmile Titus has caused, a hundred eyes have wept.\'\'Long live Titus!\' cried Pansa, overhearing the emperor\'s name, as heswept patronizingly through the crowd; \'he has promised my brother aquaestorship, because he had run through his fortune.\'\'And wishes now to enrich himself among the people, my Pansa,\' saidGlaucus.\'Exactly so,\' said Pansa.\'That is putting the people to some use,\' said Glaucus.\'To be sure, returned Pansa.  \'Well, I must go and look after theaerarium--it is a little out of repair\'; and followed by a long train ofclients, distinguished from the rest of the throng by the togas theywore (for togas, once the sign of freedom in a citizen, were now thebadge of servility to a patron), the aedile fidgeted fussily away.\'Poor Pansa!\' said Lepidus: \'he never has time for pleasure.  ThankHeaven I am not an aedile!\'\'Ah, Glaucus! how are you? gay as ever?\' said Clodius, joining thegroup.\'Are you come to sacrifice to Fortune?\' said Sallust.\'I sacrifice to her every night,\' returned the gamester.\'I do not doubt it.  No man has made more victims!\'\'By Hercules, a biting speech!\' cried Glaucus, laughing.\'The dog\'s letter is never out of your mouth, Sallust,\' said Clodius,angrily: \'you are always snarling.\'\'I may well have the dog\'s letter in my mouth, since, whenever I playwith you, I have the dog\'s throw in my hand,\' returned Sallust.\'Hist!\' said Glaucus, taking a rose from a flower-girl, who stoodbeside.\'The rose is the token of silence,\' replied Sallust, \'but I love only tosee it at the supper-table.\'\'Talking of that, Diomed gives a grand feast next week,\' said Sallust:\'are you invited, Glaucus?\'\'Yes, I received an invitation this morning.\'\'And I, too,\' said Sallust, drawing a square piece of papyrus from hisgirdle: \'I see that he asks us an hour earlier than usual: an earnest ofsomething sumptuous.\'\'Oh! he is rich as Croesus,\' said Clodius; \'and his bill of fare is aslong as an epic.\'\'Well, let us to the baths,\' said Glaucus: \'this is the time when allthe world is there; and Fulvius, whom you admire so much, is going toread us his last ode.\'The young men assented readily to the proposal, and they strolled to thebaths.Although the public thermae, or baths, were instituted rather for thepoorer citizens than the wealthy (for the last had baths in their ownhouses), yet, to the crowds of all ranks who resorted to them, it was afavorite place for conversation, and for that indolent lounging so dearto a gay and thoughtless people.  The baths at Pompeii differed, ofcourse, in plan and construction from the vast and complicated thermaeof Rome; and, indeed, it seems that in each city of the empire there wasalways some slight modification of arrangement in the generalarchitecture of the public baths. This mightily puzzles the learned--asif architects and fashion were not capricious before the nineteenthcentury!  Our party entered by the principal porch in the Street ofFortune.  At the wing of the portico sat the keeper of the baths, withhis two boxes before him, one for the money he received, one for thetickets he dispensed.  Round the walls of the portico were seats crowdedwith persons of all ranks; while others, as the regimen of thephysicians prescribed, were walking briskly to and fro the portico,stopping every now and then to gaze on the innumerable notices of shows,games, sales, exhibitions, which were painted or inscribed upon thewalls. The general subject of conversation was, however, the spectacleannounced in the amphitheatre; and each new-comer was fastened upon by agroup eager to know if Pompeii had been so fortunate as to produce somemonstrous criminal, some happy case of sacrilege or of murder, whichwould allow the aediles to provide a man for the jaws of the lion: allother more common exhibitions seemed dull and tame, when compared withthe possibility of this fortunate occurrence.\'For my part,\' said one jolly-looking man, who was a goldsmith, \'I thinkthe emperor, if he is as good as they say, might have sent us a Jew.\'\'Why not take one of the new sect of Nazarenes?\' said a philosopher.  \'Iam not cruel: but an atheist, one who denies Jupiter himself, deservesno mercy.\'\'I care not how many gods a man likes to believe in,\' said thegoldsmith; \'but to deny all gods is something monstrous.\'\'Yet I fancy,\' said Glaucus, \'that these people are not absolutelyatheists. I am told that they believe in a God--nay, in a future state.\'\'Quite a mistake, my dear Glaucus,\' said the philosopher.  \'I haveconferred with them--they laughed in my face when I talked of Pluto andHades.\'\'O ye gods!\' exclaimed the goldsmith, in horror; \'are there any of thesewretches in Pompeii?\'\'I know there are a few: but they meet so privately that it isimpossible to discover who they are.\'As Glaucus turned away, a sculptor, who was a great enthusiast in hisart, looked after him admiringly.\'Ah!\' said he, \'if we could get him on the arena--there would be a modelfor you! What limbs! what a head! he ought to have been a gladiator!  Asubject--a subject--worthy of our art!  Why don\'t they give him to thelion?\'Meanwhile Fulvius, the Roman poet, whom his contemporaries declaredimmortal, and who, but for this history, would never have been heard ofin our neglectful age, came eagerly up to Glaucus. \'Oh, my Athenian, myGlaucus, you have come to hear my ode!  That is indeed an honour; you, aGreek--to whom the very language of common life is poetry.  How I thankyou. It is but a trifle; but if I secure your approbation, perhaps I mayget an introduction to Titus.  Oh, Glaucus! a poet without a patron isan amphora without a label; the wine may be good, but nobody will laudit!  And what says Pythagoras?--""Frankincense to the gods, but praise toman."" A patron, then, is the poet\'s priest: he procures him the incense,and obtains him his believers.\'\'But all Pompeii is your patron, and every portico an altar in yourpraise.\'\'Ah! the poor Pompeians are very civil--they love to honour merit. Butthey are only the inhabitants of a petty town--spero meliora! Shall wewithin?\'\'Certainly; we lose time till we hear your poem.\'At this instant there was a rush of some twenty persons from the bathsinto the portico; and a slave stationed at the door of a small corridornow admitted the poet, Glaucus, Clodius, and a troop of the bard\'s otherfriends, into the passage.\'A poor place this, compared with the Roman thermae!\' said Lepidus,disdainfully.\'Yet is there some taste in the ceiling,\' said Glaucus, who was in amood to be pleased with everything; pointing to the stars which studdedthe roof.Lepidus shrugged his shoulders, but was too languid to reply.They now entered a somewhat spacious chamber, which served for thepurposes of the apodyterium (that is, a place where the bathers preparedthemselves for their luxurious ablutions).  The vaulted ceiling wasraised from a cornice, glowingly colored with motley and grotesquepaintings; the ceiling itself was paneled in white compartments borderedwith rich crimson; the unsullied and shining floor was paved with whitemosaics, and along the walls were ranged benches for the accommodationof the loiterers.  This chamber did not possess the numerous andspacious windows which Vitruvius attributes to his more magnificentfrigidarium.  The Pompeians, as all the southern Italians, were fond ofbanishing the light of their sultry skies, and combined in theirvoluptuous associations the idea of luxury with darkness.  Two windowsof glass alone admitted the soft and shaded ray; and the compartment inwhich one of these casements was placed was adorned with a large reliefof the destruction of the Titans.In this apartment Fulvius seated himself with a magisterial air, and hisaudience gathering round him, encouraged him to commence his recital.The poet did not require much pressing.  He drew forth from his vest aroll of papyrus, and after hemming three times, as much to commandsilence as to clear his voice, he began that wonderful ode, of which, tothe great mortification of the author of this history, no single versecan be discovered.By the plaudits he received, it was doubtless worthy of his fame; andGlaucus was the only listener who did not find it excel the best odes ofHorace.The poem concluded, those who took only the cold bath began to undress;they suspended their garments on hooks fastened in the wall, andreceiving, according to their condition, either from their own slaves orthose of the thermae, loose robes in exchange, withdrew into thatgraceful circular building which yet exists, to shame the unlavingposterity of the south.The more luxurious departed by another door to the tepidarium, a placewhich was heated to a voluptuous warmth, partly by a movable fireplace,principally by a suspended pavement, beneath which was conducted thecaloric of the laconicum.Here this portion of the intended bathers, after unrobing themselves,remained for some time enjoying the artificial warmth of the luxuriousair. And this room, as befitted its important rank in the long processof ablution, was more richly and elaborately decorated than the rest;the arched roof was beautifully carved and painted; the windows above,of ground glass, admitted but wandering and uncertain rays; below themassive cornices were rows of figures in massive and bold relief; thewalls glowed with crimson, the pavement was skillfully tessellated inwhite mosaics.  Here the habituated bathers, men who bathed seven timesa day, would remain in a state of enervate and speechless lassitude,either before or (mostly) after the water-bath; and many of thesevictims of the pursuit of health turned their listless eyes on thenewcomers, recognizing their friends with a nod, but dreading thefatigue of conversation.From this place the party again diverged, according to their severalfancies, some to the sudatorium, which answered the purpose of ourvapor-baths, and thence to the warm-bath itself; those more accustomedto exercise, and capable of dispensing with so cheap a purchase offatigue, resorted at once to the calidarium, or water-bath.In order to complete this sketch, and give to the reader an adequatenotion of this, the main luxury of the ancients, we will accompanyLepidus, who regularly underwent the whole process, save only the coldbath, which had gone lately out of fashion.  Being then gradually warmedin the tepidarium, which has just been described, the delicate steps ofthe Pompeian elegant were conducted to the sudatorium.  Here let thereader depict to himself the gradual process of the vapor-bath,accompanied by an exhalation of spicy perfumes.  After our bather hadundergone this operation, he was seized by his slaves, who alwaysawaited him at the baths, and the dews of heat were removed by a kind ofscraper, which (by the way) a modern traveler has gravely declared to beused only to remove the dirt, not one particle of which could eversettle on the polished skin of the practised bather. Thence, somewhatcooled, he passed into the water-bath, over which fresh perfumes wereprofusely scattered, and on emerging from the opposite part of the room,a cooling shower played over his head and form.  Then wrapping himselfin a light robe, he returned once more to the tepidarium, where he foundGlaucus, who had not encountered the sudatorium; and now, the maindelight and extravagance of the bath commenced.  Their slaves anointedthe bathers from vials of gold, of alabaster, or of crystal, studdedwith profusest gems, and containing the rarest unguents gathered fromall quarters of the world.  The number of these smegmata used by thewealthy would fill a modern volume--especially if the volume wereprinted by a fashionable publisher; Amaracinum, Megalium, Nardum--omnequod exit in um--while soft music played in an adjacent chamber, andsuch as used the bath in moderation, refreshed and restored by thegrateful ceremony, conversed with all the zest and freshness ofrejuvenated life.\'Blessed be he who invented baths!\' said Glaucus, stretching himselfalong one of those bronze seats (then covered with soft cushions) whichthe visitor to Pompeii sees at this day in that same tepidarium.\'Whether he were Hercules or Bacchus, he deserved deification.\'\'But tell me,\' said a corpulent citizen, who was groaning and wheezingunder the operation of being rubbed down, \'tell me, O Glaucus!--evilchance to thy hands, O slave! why so rough?--tell me--ugh--ugh!--are thebaths at Rome really so magnificent?\' Glaucus turned, and recognizedDiomed, though not without some difficulty, so red and so inflamed werethe good man\'s cheeks by the sudatory and the scraping he had so latelyundergone.  \'I fancy they must be a great deal finer than these.  Eh?\'Suppressing a smile, Glaucus replied:\'Imagine all Pompeii converted into baths, and you will then form anotion of the size of the imperial thermae of Rome.  But a notion of thesize only. Imagine every entertainment for mind and body--enumerate allthe gymnastic games our fathers invented--repeat all the books Italy andGreece have produced--suppose places for all these games, admirers forall these works--add to this, baths of the vastest size, the mostcomplicated construction--intersperse the whole with gardens, withtheatres, with porticoes, with schools--suppose, in one word, a city ofthe gods, composed but of palaces and public edifices, and you may formsome faint idea of the glories of the great baths of Rome.\'\'By Hercules!\' said Diomed, opening his eyes, \'why, it would take aman\'s whole life to bathe!\'\'At Rome, it often does so,\' replied Glaucus, gravely.  \'There are manywho live only at the baths.  They repair there the first hour in whichthe doors are opened, and remain till that in which the doors areclosed.  They seem as if they knew nothing of the rest of Rome, as ifthey despised all other existence.\'\'By Pollux! you amaze me.\'\'Even those who bathe only thrice a day contrive to consume their livesin this occupation.  They take their exercise in the tennis-court or theporticoes, to prepare them for the first bath; they lounge into thetheatre, to refresh themselves after it.  They take their prandium underthe trees, and think over their second bath. By the time it is prepared,the prandium is digested.  From the second bath they stroll into one ofthe peristyles, to hear some new poet recite: or into the library, tosleep over an old one. Then comes the supper, which they still considerbut a part of the bath: and then a third time they bathe again, as thebest place to converse with their friends.\'\'Per Hercle! but we have their imitators at Pompeii.\'\'Yes, and without their excuse.  The magnificent voluptuaries of theRoman baths are happy: they see nothing but gorgeousness and splendor;they visit not the squalid parts of the city; they know not that thereis poverty in the world.  All Nature smiles for them, and her only frownis the last one which sends them to bathe in Cocytus. Believe me, theyare your only true philosophers.\'While Glaucus was thus conversing, Lepidus, with closed eyes and scarceperceptible breath, was undergoing all the mystic operations, not one ofwhich he ever suffered his attendants to omit.  After the perfumes andthe unguents, they scattered over him the luxurious powder whichprevented any further accession of heat: and this being rubbed away bythe smooth surface of the pumice, he began to indue, not the garments hehad put off, but those more festive ones termed \'the synthesis\', withwhich the Romans marked their respect for the coming ceremony of supper,if rather, from its hour (three o\'clock in our measurement of time), itmight not be more fitly denominated dinner.  This done, he at lengthopened his eyes and gave signs of returning life.At the same time, too, Sallust betokened by a long yawn the evidence ofexistence.\'It is supper time,\' said the epicure; \'you, Glaucus and Lepidus, comeand sup with me.\'\'Recollect you are all three engaged to my house next week,\' criedDiomed, who was mightily proud of the acquaintance of men of fashion.\'Ah, ah! we recollect,\' said Sallust; \'the seat of memory, my Diomed, iscertainly in the stomach.\'Passing now once again into the cooler air, and so into the street, ourgallants of that day concluded the ceremony of a Pompeian bath.Chapter VIIIARBACES COGS HIS DICE WITH PLEASURE AND WINS THE GAME.THE evening darkened over the restless city as Apaecides took his way tothe house of the Egyptian.  He avoided the more lighted and populousstreets; and as he strode onward with his head buried in his bosom, andhis arms folded within his robe, there was something startling in thecontrast, which his solemn mien and wasted form presented to thethoughtless brows and animated air of those who occasionally crossed hispath.At length, however, a man of a more sober and staid demeanor, and whohad twice passed him with a curious but doubting look, touched him onthe shoulder.\'Apaecides!\' said he, and he made a rapid sign with his hands: it wasthe sign of the cross.\'Well, Nazarene,\' replied the priest, and his face grew paler; \'whatwouldst thou?\'\'Nay,\' returned the stranger, \'I would not interrupt thy meditations;but the last time we met, I seemed not to be so unwelcome.\'\'You are not unwelcome, Olinthus; but I am sad and weary: nor am I ablethis evening to discuss with you those themes which are most acceptableto you.\'\'O backward of heart!\' said Olinthus, with bitter fervor; and art thousad and weary, and wilt thou turn from the very springs that refresh andheal?\'\'O earth!\' cried the young priest, striking his breast passionately,\'from what regions shall my eyes open to the true Olympus, where thygods really dwell?  Am I to believe with this man, that none whom for somany centuries my fathers worshipped have a being or a name?  Am I tobreak down, as something blasphemous and profane, the very altars whichI have deemed most sacred? or am I to think with Arbaces--what?\' Hepaused, and strode rapidly away in the impatience of a man who strivesto get rid of himself.  But the Nazarene was one of those hardy,vigorous, and enthusiastic men, by whom God in all times has worked therevolutions of earth, and those, above all, in the establishment and inthe reformation of His own religion--men who were formed to convert,because formed to endure.  It is men of this mould whom nothingdiscourages, nothing dismays; in the fervor of belief they are inspiredand they inspire.  Their reason first kindles their passion, but thepassion is the instrument they use; they force themselves into men\'shearts, while they appear only to appeal to their judgment.  Nothing isso contagious as enthusiasm; it is the real allegory of the tale ofOrpheus--it moves stones, it charms brutes.  Enthusiasm is the genius ofsincerity, and truth accomplishes no victories without it.Olinthus did not then suffer Apaecides thus easily to escape him.  Heovertook and addressed him thus:\'I do not wonder, Apaecides, that I distress you; that I shake all theelements of your mind: that you are lost in doubt; that you drift hereand there in the vast ocean of uncertain and benighted thought.  Iwonder not at this, but bear with me a little; watch and pray--thedarkness shall vanish, the storm sleep, and God Himself, as He came ofyore on the seas of Samaria, shall walk over the lulled billows, to thedelivery of your soul.  Ours is a religion jealous in its demands, buthow infinitely prodigal in its gifts! It troubles you for an hour, itrepays you by immortality.\'\'Such promises,\' said Apaecides, sullenly, \'are the tricks by which manis ever gulled.  Oh, glorious were the promises which led me to theshrine of Isis!\'\'But,\' answered the Nazarene, \'ask thy reason, can that religion besound which outrages all morality?  You are told to worship your gods.What are those gods, even according to yourselves?  What their actions,what their attributes?  Are they not all represented to you as theblackest of criminals? yet you are asked to serve them as the holiest ofdivinities. Jupiter himself is a parricide and an adulterer.  What arethe meaner deities but imitators of his vices?  You are told not tomurder, but you worship murderers; you are told not to commit adultery,and you make your prayers to an adulterer!  Oh!  what is this but amockery of the holiest part of man\'s nature, which is faith?  Turn nowto the God, the one, the true God, to whose shrine I would lead you.  IfHe seem to you too sublime, two shadowy, for those human associations,those touching connections between Creator and creature, to which theweak heart clings--contemplate Him in His Son, who put on mortality likeourselves.  His mortality is not indeed declared, like that of yourfabled gods, by the vices of our nature, but by the practice of all itsvirtues.  In Him are united the austerest morals with the tenderestaffections.  If He were but a mere man, He had been worthy to become agod.  You honour Socrates--he has his sect, his disciples, his schools.But what are the doubtful virtues of the Athenian, to the bright, theundisputed, the active, the unceasing, the devoted holiness of Christ?I speak to you now only of His human character.  He came in that as thepattern of future ages, to show us the form of virtue which Platothirsted to see embodied. This was the true sacrifice that He made forman; but the halo that encircled His dying hour not only brightenedearth, but opened to us the sight of heaven!  You are touched--you aremoved.  God works in your heart.  His Spirit is with you.  Come, resistnot the holy impulse; come at once--unhesitatingly.  A few of us are nowassembled to expound the word of God.  Come, let me guide you to them.You are sad, you are weary.  Listen, then, to the words of God: ""Come tome"", saith He, ""all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest!""\'\'I cannot now,\' said Apaecides; \'another time.\'\'Now--now!\' exclaimed Olinthus, earnestly, and clasping him by the arm.But Apaecides, yet unprepared for the renunciation of that faith--thatlife, for which he had sacrificed so much, and still haunted by thepromises of the Egyptian, extricated himself forcibly from the grasp;and feeling an effort necessary to conquer the irresolution which theeloquence of the Christian had begun to effect in his heated andfeverish mind, he gathered up his robes and fled away with a speed thatdefied pursuit.Breathless and exhausted, he arrived at last in a remote and sequesteredpart of the city, and the lone house of the Egyptian stood before him.As he paused to recover himself, the moon emerged from a silver cloud,and shone full upon the walls of that mysterious habitation.No other house was near--the darksome vines clustered far and wide infront of the building and behind it rose a copse of lofty forest trees,sleeping in the melancholy moonlight; beyond stretched the dim outlineof the distant hills, and amongst them the quiet crest of Vesuvius, notthen so lofty as the traveler beholds it now.Apaecides passed through the arching vines, and arrived at the broad andspacious portico.  Before it, on either side of the steps, reposed theimage of the Egyptian sphinx, and the moonlight gave an additional andyet more solemn calm to those large, and harmonious, and passionlessfeatures, in which the sculptors of that type of wisdom united so muchof loveliness with awe; half way up the extremities of the stepsdarkened the green and massive foliage of the aloe, and the shadow ofthe eastern palm cast its long and unwaving boughs partially over themarble surface of the stairs.Something there was in the stillness of the place, and the strangeaspect of the sculptured sphinxes, which thrilled the blood of thepriest with a nameless and ghostly fear, and he longed even for an echoto his noiseless steps as he ascended to the threshold.He knocked at the door, over which was wrought an inscription incharacters unfamiliar to his eyes; it opened without a sound, and a tallEthiopian slave, without question or salutation, motioned to him toproceed.The wide hall was lighted by lofty candelabra of elaborate bronze, andround the walls were wrought vast hieroglyphics, in dark and solemncolors, which contrasted strangely with the bright hues and gracefulshapes with which the inhabitants of Italy decorated their abodes.  Atthe extremity of the hall, a slave, whose countenance, though notAfrican, was darker by many shades than the usual color of the south,advanced to meet him.\'I seek Arbaces,\' said the priest; but his voice trembled even in hisown ear.  The slave bowed his head in silence, and leading Apaecides toa wing without the hall, conducted him up a narrow staircase, and thentraversing several rooms, in which the stern and thoughtful beauty ofthe sphinx still made the chief and most impressive object of thepriest\'s notice, Apaecides found himself in a dim and half-lightedchamber, in the presence of the Egyptian.Arbaces was seated before a small table, on which lay unfolded severalscrolls of papyrus, impressed with the same character as that on thethreshold of the mansion.  A small tripod stood at a little distance,from the incense in which the smoke slowly rose.  Near this was a vastglobe, depicting the signs of heaven; and upon another table lay severalinstruments, of curious and quaint shape, whose uses were unknown toApaecides.  The farther extremity of the room was concealed by acurtain, and the oblong window in the roof admitted the rays of themoon, mingling sadly with the single lamp which burned in the apartment.\'Seat yourself, Apaecides,\' said the Egyptian, without rising.The young man obeyed.\'You ask me,\' resumed Arbaces, after a short pause, in which he seemedabsorbed in thought--\'You ask me, or would do so, the mightiest secretswhich the soul of man is fitted to receive; it is the enigma of lifeitself that you desire me to solve.  Placed like children in the dark,and but for a little while, in this dim and confined existence, we shapeour spectres in the obscurity; our thoughts now sink back into ourselvesin terror, now wildly plunge themselves into the guideless gloom,guessing what it may contain; stretching our helpless hands here andthere, lest, blindly, we stumble upon some hidden danger; not knowingthe limits of our boundary, now feeling them suffocate us withcompression, now seeing them extend far away till they vanish intoeternity.  In this state all wisdom consists necessarily in the solutionof two questions: ""What are we to believe? and What are we to reject?""These questions you desire me to decide.\'Apaecides bowed his head in assent.\'Man must have some belief,\' continued the Egyptian, in a tone ofsadness. \'He must fasten his hope to something: is our common naturethat you inherit when, aghast and terrified to see that in which youhave been taught to place your faith swept away, you float over a drearyand shoreless sea of incertitude, you cry for help, you ask for someplank to cling to, some land, however dim and distant, to attain.  Well,then, have not forgotten our conversation of to-day?\'\'Forgotten!\'\'I confessed to you that those deities for whom smoke so many altarswere but inventions.  I confessed to you that our rites and ceremonieswere but mummeries, to delude and lure the herd to their proper good.  Iexplained to you that from those delusions came the bonds of society,the harmony of the world, the power of the wise; that power is in theobedience of the vulgar. Continue we then these salutary delusions--ifman must have some belief, continue to him that which his fathers havemade dear to him, and which custom sanctifies and strengthens.  Inseeking a subtler faith for us, whose senses are too spiritual for thegross one, let us leave others that support which crumbles fromourselves.  This is wise--it is benevolent.\'\'Proceed.\'\'This being settled,\' resumed the Egyptian, \'the old landmarks beingleft uninjured for those whom we are about to desert, we gird up ourloins and depart to new climes of faith.  Dismiss at once from yourrecollection, from your thought, all that you have believed before.Suppose the mind a blank, an unwritten scroll, fit to receiveimpressions for the first time.  Look round the world--observe itsorder--its regularity--its design.  Something must have created it--thedesign speaks a designer: in that certainty we first touch land.  Butwhat is that something?--A god, you cry.  Stay--no confusedand confusing names.  Of that which created the world, we know,we can know, nothing, save these attributes--power and unvaryingregularity--stern, crushing, relentless regularity--heeding noindividual cases--rolling--sweeping--burning on; no matter whatscattered hearts, severed from the general mass, fall ground andscorched beneath its wheels. The mixture of evil with good--theexistence of suffering and of crime--in all times have perplexed thewise.  They created a god--they supposed him benevolent.  How then camethis evil? why did he permit it--nay, why invent, why perpetuate it?  Toaccount for this, the Persian creates a second spirit, whose nature isevil, and supposes a continual war between that and the god of good.  Inour own shadowy and tremendous Typhon, the Egyptians image a similardemon.  Perplexing blunder that yet more bewilders us!--folly that arosefrom the vain delusion that makes a palpable, a corporeal, a humanbeing, of this unknown power--that clothes the Invisible with attributesand a nature similar to the Seen.  No: to this designer let us give aname that does not command our bewildering associations, and the mysterybecomes more clear--that name is NECESSITY.  Necessity, say the Greeks,compels the gods.  Then why the gods?--their agency becomesunnecessary--dismiss them at once. Necessity is the ruler of all wesee--power, regularity--these two qualities make its nature.  Would youask more?--you can learn nothing: whether it be eternal--whether itcompel us, its creatures, to new careers after that darkness which wecall death--we cannot tell.  There leave we this ancient, unseen,unfathomable power, and come to that which, to our eyes, is the greatminister of its functions. This we can task more, from this we can learnmore: its evidence is around us--its name is NATURE.  The error of thesages has been to direct their researches to the attributes ofnecessity, where all is gloom and blindness. Had they confined theirresearches to Nature--what of knowledge might we not already haveachieved?  Here patience, examination, are never directed in vain.  Wesee what we explore; our minds ascend a palpable ladder of causes andeffects. Nature is the great agent of the external universe, andNecessity imposes upon it the laws by which it acts, and imparts to usthe powers by which we examine; those powers are curiosity andmemory--their union is reason, their perfection is wisdom.  Well, then,I examine by the help of these powers this inexhaustible Nature.  Iexamine the earth, the air, the ocean, the heaven: I find that all havea mystic sympathy with each other--that the moon sways the tides--thatthe air maintains the earth, and is the medium of the life and sense ofthings--that by the knowledge of the stars we measure the limits of theearth--that we portion out the epochs of time--that by their pale lightwe are guided into the abyss of the past--that in their solemn lore wediscern the destinies of the future. And thus, while we know not thatwhich Necessity is, we learn, at least, her decrees.  And now, whatmorality do we glean from this religion?--for religion it is.  I believein two deities--Nature and Necessity; I worship the last by reverence,the first by investigation.  What is the morality my religion teaches?This--all things are subject but to general rules; the sun shines forthe joy of the many--it may bring sorrow to the few; the night shedssleep on the multitude--but it harbors murder as well as rest; theforests adorn the earth--but shelter the serpent and the lion; the oceansupports a thousand barks--but it engulfs the one. It is only thus forthe general, and not for the universal benefit, that Nature acts, andNecessity speeds on her awful course.  This is the morality of the dreadagents of the world--it is mine, who am their creature.  I wouldpreserve the delusions of priestcraft, for they are serviceable to themultitude; I would impart to man the arts I discover, the sciences Iperfect; I would speed the vast career of civilizing lore: in this Iserve the mass, I fulfill the general law, I execute the great moralthat Nature preaches.  For myself I claim the individual exception; Iclaim it for the wise--satisfied that my individual actions are nothingin the great balance of good and evil; satisfied that the product of myknowledge can give greater blessings to the mass than my desires canoperate evil on the few (for the first can extend to remotest regionsand humanize nations yet unborn), I give to the world wisdom, to myselffreedom. I enlighten the lives of others, and I enjoy my own.  Yes; ourwisdom is eternal, but our life is short: make the most of it while itlasts. Surrender thy youth to pleasure, and thy senses to delight.  Sooncomes the hour when the wine-cup is shattered, and the garlands shallcease to bloom.  Enjoy while you may.  Be still, O Apaecides, my pupiland my follower!  I will teach thee the mechanism of Nature, her darkestand her wildest secrets--the lore which fools call magic--and the mightymysteries of the stars. By this shalt thou discharge thy duty to themass; by this shalt thou enlighten thy race.  But I will lead thee alsoto pleasures of which the vulgar do not dream; and the day which thougivest to men shall be followed by the sweet night which thousurrenderest to thyself.\'As the Egyptian ceased there rose about, around, beneath, the softestmusic that Lydia ever taught, or Iona ever perfected.  It came like astream of sound, bathing the senses unawares; enervating, subduing withdelight.  It seemed the melodies of invisible spirits, such as theshepherd might have heard in the golden age, floating through the valesof Thessaly, or in the noontide glades of Paphos.  The words which hadrushed to the lip of Apaecides, in answer to the sophistries of theEgyptian, died tremblingly away.  He felt it as a profanation to breakupon that enchanted strain--the susceptibility of his excited nature,the Greek softness and ardour of his secret soul, were swayed andcaptured by surprise.  He sank on the seat with parted lips andthirsting ear; while in a chorus of voices, bland and melting as thosewhich waked Psyche in the halls of love, rose the following song:                THE HYMN OF EROS       By the cool banks where soft Cephisus flows,         A voice sail\'d trembling down the waves of air;        The leaves blushed brighter in the Teian\'s rose,         The doves couch\'d breathless in their summer lair;       While from their hands the purple flowerets fell,         The laughing Hours stood listening in the sky;--       From Pan\'s green cave to AEgle\'s haunted cell,         Heaved the charm\'d earth in one delicious sigh.       Love, sons of earth!  I am the Power of Love!         Eldest of all the gods, with Chaos born;        My smile sheds light along the courts above,         My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn.       Mine are the stars--there, ever as ye gaze,         Ye meet the deep spell of my haunting eyes;        Mine is the moon--and, mournful if her rays,         \'Tis that she lingers where her Carian lies.       The flowers are mine--the blushes of the rose,         The violet--charming Zephyr to the shade;        Mine the quick light that in the Maybeam glows,         And mine the day-dream in the lonely glade.       Love, sons of earth--for love is earth\'s soft lore,         Look where ye will--earth overflows with ME;        Learn from the waves that ever kiss the shore,         And the winds nestling on the heaving sea.       \'All teaches love!\'--The sweet voice, like a dream,         Melted in light; yet still the airs above,        The waving sedges, and the whispering stream,         And the green forest rustling, murmur\'d \'LOVE!\'As the voices died away, the Egyptian seized the hand of Apaecides, andled him, wandering, intoxicated, yet half-reluctant, across the chambertowards the curtain at the far end; and now, from behind that curtain,there seemed to burst a thousand sparkling stars; the veil itself,hitherto dark, was now lighted by these fires behind into the tenderestblue of heaven.  It represented heaven itself--such a heaven, as in thenights of June might have shone down over the streams of Castaly.  Hereand there were painted rosy and aerial clouds, from which smiled, by thelimner\'s art, faces of divinest beauty, and on which reposed the shapesof which Phidias and Apelles dreamed.  And the stars which studded thetransparent azure rolled rapidly as they shone, while the music, thatagain woke with a livelier and lighter sound, seemed to imitate themelody of the joyous spheres.\'Oh! what miracle is this, Arbaces,\' said Apaecides in falteringaccents. \'After having denied the gods, art thou about to reveal tome...\'\'Their pleasures!\' interrupted Arbaces, in a tone so different from itsusual cold and tranquil harmony that Apaecides started, and thought theEgyptian himself transformed; and now, as they neared the curtain, awild--a loud--an exulting melody burst from behind its concealment.With that sound the veil was rent in twain--it parted--it seemed tovanish into air: and a scene, which no Sybarite ever more than rivalled,broke upon the dazzled gaze of the youthful priest.  A vast banquet-roomstretched beyond, blazing with countless lights, which filled the warmair with the scents of frankincense, of jasmine, of violets, of myrrh;all that the most odorous flowers, all that the most costly spices coulddistil, seemed gathered into one ineffable and ambrosial essence: fromthe light columns that sprang upwards to the airy roof, hung draperiesof white, studded with golden stars.  At the extremities of the room twofountains cast up a spray, which, catching the rays of the roseatelight, glittered like countless diamonds. In the centre of the room asthey entered there rose slowly from the floor, to the sound of unseenminstrelsy, a table spread with all the viands which sense ever devotedto fancy, and vases of that lost Myrrhine fabric, so glowing in itscolors, so transparent in its material, were crowned with the exotics ofthe East.  The couches, to which this table was the centre, were coveredwith tapestries of azure and gold; and from invisible tubes the vaultedroof descended showers of fragrant waters, that cooled the deliciousair, and contended with the lamps, as if the spirits of wave and firedisputed which element could furnish forth the most delicious odorous.And now, from behind the snowy draperies, trooped such forms as Adonisbeheld when he lay on the lap of Venus.  They came, some with garlands,others with lyres; they surrounded the youth, they led his steps to thebanquet.  They flung the chaplets round him in rosy chains.  Theearth--the thought of earth, vanished from his soul.  He imaginedhimself in a dream, and suppressed his breath lest he should wake toosoon; the senses, to which he had never yielded as yet, beat in hisburning pulse, and confused his dizzy and reeling sight.  And while thusamazed and lost, once again, but in brisk and Bacchic measures, rose themagic strain:                ANACREONTIC       In the veins of the calix foams and glows          The blood of the mantling vine,        But oh! in the bowl of Youth there glows          A Lesbian, more divine!              Bright, bright,             As the liquid light,         Its waves through thine eyelids shine!       Fill up, fill up, to the sparkling brim,          The juice of the young Lyaeus;        The grape is the key that we owe to him          From the gaol of the world to free us.              Drink, drink!             What need to shrink,         When the lambs alone can see us?       Drink, drink, as I quaff from thine eyes          The wine of a softer tree;        Give the smiles to the god of the grape--thy sighs,          Beloved one, give to me.              Turn, turn,             My glances burn,         And thirst for a look from thee!As the song ended, a group of three maidens, entwined with a chain ofstarred flowers, and who, while they imitated, might have shamed theGraces, advanced towards him in the gliding measures of the Ioniandance: such as the Nereids wreathed in moonlight on the yellow sands ofthe AEgean wave--such as Cytherea taught her handmaids in themarriage-feast of Psyche and her son.Now approaching, they wreathed their chaplet round his head; nowkneeling, the youngest of the three proffered him the bowl, from whichthe wine of Lesbos foamed and sparkled.  The youth resisted no more, hegrasped the intoxicating cup, the blood mantled fiercely through hisveins.  He sank upon the breast of the nymph who sat beside him, andturning with swimming eyes to seek for Arbaces, whom he had lost in thewhirl of his emotions, he beheld him seated beneath a canopy at theupper end of the table, and gazing upon him with a smile that encouragedhim to pleasure.  He beheld him, but not as he had hitherto seen, withdark and sable garments, with a brooding and solemn brow: a robe thatdazzled the sight, so studded was its whitest surface with gold andgems, blazed upon his majestic form; white roses, alternated with theemerald and the ruby, and shaped tiara-like, crowned his raven locks.He appeared, like Ulysses, to have gained the glory of a secondyouth--his features seemed to have exchanged thought for beauty, and hetowered amidst the loveliness that surrounded him, in all the beamingand relaxing benignity of the Olympian god.\'Drink, feast, love, my pupil!\' said he, \'blush not that thou artpassionate and young.  That which thou art, thou feelest in thy veins:that which thou shalt be, survey!\'With this he pointed to a recess, and the eyes of Apaecides, followingthe gesture, beheld on a pedestal, placed between the statues of Bacchusand Idalia, the form of a skeleton.\'Start not,\' resumed the Egyptian; \'that friendly guest admonishes usbut of the shortness of life.  From its jaws I hear a voice that summonsus to ENJOY.\'As he spoke, a group of nymphs surrounded the statue; they laid chapletson its pedestal, and, while the cups were emptied and refilled at thatglowing board, they sang the following strain:         BACCHIC HYMNS TO THE IMAGE OF DEATH                    I        Thou art in the land of the shadowy Host,           Thou that didst drink and love:         By the Solemn River, a gliding ghost,           But thy thought is ours above!                If memory yet can fly,                Back to the golden sky,           And mourn the pleasures lost!         By the ruin\'d hall these flowers we lay,           Where thy soul once held its palace;         When the rose to thy scent and sight was gay,           And the smile was in the chalice,                And the cithara\'s voice                Could bid thy heart rejoice           When night eclipsed the day.Here a new group advancing, turned the tide of the music into a quickerand more joyous strain.                    II        Death, death is the gloomy shore           Where we all sail--        Soft, soft, thou gliding oar;           Blow soft, sweet gale!         Chain with bright wreaths the Hours;           Victims if all         Ever, \'mid song and flowers,           Victims should fall!Pausing for a moment, yet quicker and quicker danced the silver-footedmusic:        Since Life\'s so short, we\'ll live to laugh,           Ah! wherefore waste a minute!         If youth\'s the cup we yet can quaff,           Be love the pearl within it!A third band now approached with brimming cups, which they poured inlibation upon that strange altar; and once more, slow and solemn, rosethe changeful melody:                  III        Thou art welcome, Guest of gloom,           From the far and fearful sea!         When the last rose sheds its bloom,           Our board shall be spread with thee!              All hail, dark Guest!           Who hath so fair a plea           Our welcome Guest to be,           As thou, whose solemn hall           At last shall feast us all           In the dim and dismal coast?           Long yet be we the Host!           And thou, Dead Shadow, thou,           All joyless though thy brow,               Thou--but our passing GUEST!At this moment, she who sat beside Apaecides suddenly took up the song:                    IV        Happy is yet our doom,           The earth and the sun are ours!         And far from the dreary tomb           Speed the wings of the rosy Hours--          Sweet is for thee the bowl,              Sweet are thy looks, my love;           I fly to thy tender soul,              As bird to its mated dove!                Take me, ah, take!           Clasp\'d to thy guardian breast,           Soft let me sink to rest:                But wake me--ah, wake!           And tell me with words and sighs,           But more with thy melting eyes,                That my sun is not set--         That the Torch is not quench\'d at the Urn           That we love, and we breathe, and burn,                Tell me--thou lov\'st me yet!BOOK THE SECONDChapter IA FLASH HOUSE IN POMPEII, AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CLASSIC RING.TO one of those parts of Pompeii, which were tenanted not by the lordsof pleasure, but by its minions and its victims; the haunt of gladiatorsand prize-fighters; of the vicious and the penniless; of the savage andthe obscene; the Alsatia of an ancient city--we are now transported.It was a large room, that opened at once on the confined and crowdedlane. Before the threshold was a group of men, whose iron andwell-strung muscles, whose short and Herculean necks, whose hardy andreckless countenances, indicated the champions of the arena. On a shelf,without the shop, were ranged jars of wine and oil; and right over thiswas inserted in the wall a coarse painting, which exhibited gladiatorsdrinking--so ancient and so venerable is the custom of signs!  Withinthe room were placed several small tables, arranged somewhat in themodern fashion of \'boxes\', and round these were seated several knots ofmen, some drinking, some playing at dice, some at that more skilful gamecalled \'duodecim scriptae\', which certain of the blundering learned havemistaken for chess, though it rather, perhaps, resembled backgammon ofthe two, and was usually, though not always, played by the assistance ofdice.  The hour was in the early forenoon, and nothing better, perhaps,than that unseasonable time itself denoted the habitual indolence ofthese tavern loungers.Yet, despite the situation of the house and the character of itsinmates, it indicated none of that sordid squalor which would havecharacterized a similar haunt in a modern city.  The gay disposition ofall the Pompeians, who sought, at least, to gratify the sense even wherethey neglected the mind, was typified by the gaudy colors whichdecorated the walls, and the shapes, fantastic but not inelegant, inwhich the lamps, the drinking-cups, the commonest household utensils,were wrought.\'By Pollux!\' said one of the gladiators, as he leaned against the wallof the threshold, \'the wine thou sellest us, old Silenus\'--and as hespoke he slapped a portly personage on the back--\'is enough to thin thebest blood in one\'s veins.\'The man thus caressingly saluted, and whose bared arms, white apron, andkeys and napkin tucked carelessly within his girdle, indicated him to bethe host of the tavern, was already passed into the autumn of his years;but his form was still so robust and athletic, that he might have shamedeven the sinewy shapes beside him, save that the muscles had seeded, asit were, into flesh, that the cheeks were swelled and bloated, and theincreasing stomach threw into shade the vast and massive chest whichrose above it.\'None of thy scurrilous blusterings with me,\' growled the giganticlandlord, in the gentle semi-roar of an insulted tiger; \'my wine is goodenough for a carcass which shall so soon soak the dust of thespoliarium.\'\'Croakest thou thus, old raven!\' returned the gladiator, laughingscornfully; \'thou shalt live to hang thyself with despite when thouseest me win the palm crown; and when I get the purse at theamphitheatre, as I certainly shall, my first vow to Hercules shall be toforswear thee and thy vile potations evermore.\'\'Hear to him--hear to this modest Pyrgopolinices!  He has certainlyserved under Bombochides Cluninstaridysarchides,\' cried the host.\'Sporus, Niger, Tetraides, he declares he shall win the purse from you.Why, by the gods! each of your muscles is strong enough to stifle allhis body, or I know nothing of the arena!\'\'Ha!\' said the gladiator, coloring with rising fury, \'our lanista wouldtell a different story.\'\'What story could he tell against me, vain Lydon?\' said Tetraides,frowning.\'Or me, who have conquered in fifteen fights?\' said the gigantic Niger,stalking up to the gladiator.\'Or me?\' grunted Sporus, with eyes of fire.\'Tush!\' said Lydon, folding his arms, and regarding his rivals with areckless air of defiance.  \'The time of trial will soon come; keep yourvalor till then.\'\'Ay, do,\' said the surly host; \'and if I press down my thumb to saveyou, may the Fates cut my thread!\'\'Your rope, you mean,\' said Lydon, sneeringly: \'here is a sesterce tobuy one.\'The Titan wine-vender seized the hand extended to him, and griped it inso stern a vice that the blood spirted from the fingers\' ends over thegarments of the bystanders.They set up a savage laugh.\'I will teach thee, young braggart, to play the Macedonian with me!  Iam no puny Persian, I warrant thee!  What, man!  have I not foughttwenty years in the ring, and never lowered my arms once?  And have Inot received the rod from the editor\'s own hand as a sign of victory,and as a grace to retirement on my laurels?  And am I now to be lecturedby a boy?\' So saying, he flung the hand from him in scorn.Without changing a muscle, but with the same smiling face with which hehad previously taunted mine host, did the gladiator brave the painfulgrasp he had undergone.  But no sooner was his hand released, than,crouching for one moment as a wild cat crouches, you might see his hairbristle on his head and beard, and with a fierce and shrill yell hesprang on the throat of the giant, with an impetus that threw him, vastand sturdy as he was, from his balance--and down, with the crash of afalling rock, he fell--while over him fell also his ferocious foe.Our host, perhaps, had had no need of the rope so kindly recommended tohim by Lydon, had he remained three minutes longer in that position.But, summoned to his assistance by the noise of his fall, a woman, whohad hitherto kept in an inner apartment, rushed to the scene of battle.This new ally was in herself a match for the gladiator; she was tall,lean, and with arms that could give other than soft embraces.  In fact,the gentle helpmate of Burbo the wine-seller had, like himself, foughtin the lists--nay under the emperor\'s eye.  And Burbo himself--Burbo,the unconquered in the field, according to report, now and then yieldedthe palm to his soft Stratonice.  This sweet creature no sooner saw theimminent peril that awaited her worse half, than without other weaponsthan those with which Nature had provided her, she darted upon theincumbent gladiator, and, clasping him round the waist with her long andsnakelike arms, lifted him by a sudden wrench from the body of herhusband, leaving only his hands still clinging to the throat of his foe.So have we seen a dog snatched by the hind legs from the strife with afallen rival in the arms of some envious groom; so have we seen one halfof him high in air--passive and offenceless--while the other half, head,teeth, eyes, claws, seemed buried and engulfed in the mangled andprostrate enemy.  Meanwhile, the gladiators, lapped, and pampered, andglutted upon blood, crowded delightedly round the combatants--theirnostrils distended--their lips grinning--their eyes gloatingly fixed onthe bloody throat of the one and the indented talons of the other.\'Habet! (he has got it!) habet!\' cried they, with a sort of yell,rubbing their nervous hands.\'Non habeo, ye liars; I have not got it!\' shouted the host, as with amighty effort he wrenched himself from those deadly hands, and rose tohis feet, breathless, panting, lacerated, bloody; and fronting, withreeling eyes, the glaring look and grinning teeth of his baffled foe,now struggling (but struggling with disdain) in the gripe of the sturdyamazon.\'Fair play!\' cried the gladiators: \'one to one\'; and, crowding roundLydon and the woman, they separated our pleasing host from his courteousguest.But Lydon, feeling ashamed at his present position, and endeavoring invain to shake off the grasp of the virago, slipped his hand into hisgirdle, and drew forth a short knife.  So menacing was his look, sobrightly gleamed the blade, that Stratonice, who was used only to thatfashion of battle which we moderns call the pugilistic, started back inalarm.\'O gods!\' cried she, \'the ruffian!--he has concealed weapons!  Is thatfair? Is that like a gentleman and a gladiator?  No, indeed, I scornsuch fellows.\' With that she contemptuously turned her back on thegladiator, and hastened to examine the condition of her husband.But he, as much inured to the constitutional exercises as an Englishbull-dog is to a contest with a more gentle antagonist, had alreadyrecovered himself.  The purple hues receded from the crimson surface ofhis cheek, the veins of the forehead retired into their wonted size.  Heshook himself with a complacent grunt, satisfied that he was stillalive, and then looking at his foe from head to foot with an air of moreapprobation than he had ever bestowed upon him before:\'By Castor!\' said he, \'thou art a stronger fellow than I took thee for!I see thou art a man of merit and virtue; give me thy hand, my hero!\'\'Jolly old Burbo!\' cried the gladiators, applauding, \'staunch to thebackbone.  Give him thy hand, Lydon.\'\'Oh, to be sure,\' said the gladiator: \'but now I have tasted his blood,I long to lap the whole.\'\'By Hercules!\' returned the host, quite unmoved, \'that is the truegladiator feeling.  Pollux! to think what good training may make a man;why, a beast could not be fiercer!\'\'A beast!  O dullard! we beat the beasts hollow!\' cried Tetraides.\'Well, well,\' said Stratonice, who was now employed in smoothing her hairand adjusting her dress, \'if ye are all good friends again, I recommendyou to be quiet and orderly; for some young noblemen, your patrons andbackers, have sent to say they will come here to pay you a visit: theywish to see you more at their ease than at the schools, before they makeup their bets on the great fight at the amphitheatre. So they alwayscome to my house for that purpose: they know we only receive the bestgladiators in Pompeii--our society is very select--praised be the gods!\'\'Yes,\' continued Burbo, drinking off a bowl, or rather a pail of wine,\'a man who has won my laurels can only encourage the brave. Lydon,drink, my boy; may you have an honorable old age like mine!\'\'Come here,\' said Stratonice, drawing her husband to her affectionatelyby the ears, in that caress which Tibullus has so prettilydescribed--\'Come here!\'\'Not so hard, she-wolf! thou art worse than the gladiator,\' murmured thehuge jaws of Burbo.\'Hist!\' said she, whispering him; \'Calenus has just stole in, disguised,by the back way.  I hope he has brought the sesterces.\'\'Ho! ho! I will join him,\' said Burbo; \'meanwhile, I say, keep a sharpeye on the cups--attend to the score.  Let them not cheat thee, wife;they are heroes, to be sure, but then they are arrant rogues: Cacus wasnothing to them.\'\'Never fear me, fool!\' was the conjugal reply; and Burbo, satisfied withthe dear assurance, strode through the apartment, and sought thepenetralia of his house.\'So those soft patrons are coming to look at our muscles,\' said Niger.\'Who sent to previse thee of it, my mistress?\'\'Lepidus.  He brings with him Clodius, the surest better in Pompeii, andthe young Greek, Glaucus.\'\'A wager on a wager,\' cried Tetraides; \'Clodius bets on me, for twentysesterces!  What say you, Lydon?\'\'He bets on me!\' said Lydon.\'No, on me!\' grunted Sporus.\'Dolts! do you think he would prefer any of you to Niger?\' said theathletic, thus modestly naming himself.\'Well, well,\' said Stratonice, as she pierced a huge amphora for herguests, who had now seated themselves before one of the tables, \'greatmen and brave, as ye all think yourselves, which of you will fight theNumidian lion in case no malefactor should be found to deprive you ofthe option?\'\'I who have escaped your arms, stout Stratonice,\' said Lydon, \'mightsafely, I think, encounter the lion.\'\'But tell me,\' said Tetraides, \'where is that pretty young slave ofyours--the blind girl, with bright eyes?  I have not seen her a longtime.\'\'Oh! she is too delicate for you, my son of Neptune,\' said the hostess,\'and too nice even for us, I think.  We send her into the town to sellflowers and sing to the ladies: she makes us more money so than shewould by waiting on you.  Besides, she has often other employments whichlie under the rose.\'\'Other employments!\' said Niger; \'why, she is too young for them.\'\'Silence, beast!\' said Stratonice; \'you think there is no play but theCorinthian.  If Nydia were twice the age she is at present, she would beequally fit for Vesta--poor girl!\'\'But, hark ye, Stratonice,\' said Lydon; \'how didst thou come by sogentle and delicate a slave?  She were more meet for the handmaid ofsome rich matron of Rome than for thee.\'\'That is true,\' returned Stratonice; \'and some day or other I shall makemy fortune by selling her.  How came I by Nydia, thou askest.\'\'Ay!\'\'Why, thou seest, my slave Staphyla--thou rememberest Staphyla, Niger?\'\'Ay, a large-handed wench, with a face like a comic mask.  How should Iforget her, by Pluto, whose handmaid she doubtless is at this moment!\'\'Tush, brute!--Well, Staphyla died one day, and a great loss she was tome, and I went into the market to buy me another slave.  But, by thegods! they were all grown so dear since I had bought poor Staphyla, andmoney was so scarce, that I was about to leave the place in despair,when a merchant plucked me by the robe.  ""Mistress,"" said he, ""dost thouwant a slave cheap I have a child to sell--a bargain. She is but little,and almost an infant, it is true; but she is quick and quiet, docile andclever, sings well, and is of good blood, I assure you."" ""Of whatcountry?"" said I.  ""Thessalian."" Now I knew the Thessalians were acuteand gentle; so I said I would see the girl.  I found her just as you seeher now, scarcely smaller and scarcely younger in appearance.  Shelooked patient and resigned enough, with her hands crossed on her bosom,and her eyes downcast. I asked the merchant his price: it was moderate,and I bought her at once.  The merchant brought her to my house, anddisappeared in an instant.  Well, my friends, guess my astonishment whenI found she was blind!  Ha! ha! a clever fellow that merchant!  I ran atonce to the magistrates, but the rogue was already gone from Pompeii. SoI was forced to go home in a very ill humor, I assure you; and the poorgirl felt the effects of it too.  But it was not her fault that she wasblind, for she had been so from her birth.  By degrees, we gotreconciled to our purchase.  True, she had not the strength of Staphyla,and was of very little use in the house, but she could soon find her wayabout the town, as well as if she had the eyes of Argus; and when onemorning she brought us home a handful of sesterces, which she said shehad got from selling some flowers she had gathered in our poor littlegarden, we thought the gods had sent her to us.  So from that time welet her go out as she likes, filling her basket with flowers, which shewreathes into garlands after the Thessalian fashion, which pleases thegallants; and the great people seem to take a fancy to her, for theyalways pay her more than they do any other flower-girl, and she bringsall of it home to us, which is more than any other slave would do.  So Iwork for myself, but I shall soon afford from her earnings to buy me asecond Staphyla; doubtless, the Thessalian kidnapper had stolen theblind girl from gentle parents.  Besides her skill in the garlands, shesings and plays on the cithara, which also brings money, and lately--butthat is a secret.\'\'That is a secret! What!\' cried Lydon, \'art thou turned sphinx?\'\'Sphinx, no!--why sphinx?\'\'Cease thy gabble, good mistress, and bring us our meat--I am hungry,\'said Sporus, impatiently.\'And I, too,\' echoed the grim Niger, whetting his knife on the palm ofhis hand.The amazon stalked away to the kitchen, and soon returned with a trayladen with large pieces of meat half-raw: for so, as now, did the heroesof the prize-fight imagine they best sustained their hardihood andferocity: they drew round the table with the eyes of famishedwolves--the meat vanished, the wine flowed.  So leave we those importantpersonages of classic life to follow the steps of Burbo.Chapter IITWO WORTHIES.IN the earlier times of Rome the priesthood was a profession, not oflucre but of honour.  It was embraced by the noblest citizens--it wasforbidden to the plebeians.  Afterwards, and long previous to thepresent date, it was equally open to all ranks; at least, that part ofthe profession which embraced the flamens, or priests--not of religiongenerally but of peculiar gods.  Even the priest of Jupiter (the FlamenDialis) preceded by a lictor, and entitled by his office to the entranceof the senate, at first the especial dignitary of the patricians, wassubsequently the choice of the people.  The less national and lesshonored deities were usually served by plebeian ministers; and manyembraced the profession, as now the Roman Catholic Christians enter themonastic fraternity, less from the impulse of devotion than thesuggestions of a calculating poverty.  Thus Calenus, the priest of Isis,was of the lowest origin.  His relations, though not his parents, werefreedmen.  He had received from them a liberal education, and from hisfather a small patrimony, which he had soon exhausted.  He embraced thepriesthood as a last resource from distress.  Whatever the stateemoluments of the sacred profession, which at that time were probablysmall, the officers of a popular temple could never complain of theprofits of their calling.  There is no profession so lucrative as thatwhich practises on the superstition of the multitude.Calenus had but one surviving relative at Pompeii, and that was Burbo.Various dark and disreputable ties, stronger than those of blood, unitedtogether their hearts and interests; and often the minister of Isisstole disguised and furtively from the supposed austerity of hisdevotions; and gliding through the back door of the retired gladiator, aman infamous alike by vices and by profession, rejoiced to throw off thelast rag of an hypocrisy which, but for the dictates of avarice, hisruling passion, would at all time have sat clumsily upon a nature toobrutal for even the mimicry of virtue.Wrapped in one of those large mantles which came in use among the Romansin proportion as they dismissed the toga, whose ample folds wellconcealed the form, and in which a sort of hood (attached to it)afforded no less a security to the features, Calenus now sat in thesmall and private chamber of the wine-cellar, whence a small passage ranat once to that back entrance, with which nearly all the houses ofPompeii were furnished.Opposite to him sat the sturdy Burbo, carefully counting on a tablebetween them a little pile of coins which the priest had just pouredfrom his purse--for purses were as common then as now, with thisdifference--they were usually better furnished!\'You see,\' said Calenus, \'that we pay you handsomely, and you ought tothank me for recommending you to so advantageous a market.\'\'I do, my cousin, I do,\' replied Burbo, affectionately, as he swept thecoins into a leathern receptacle, which he then deposited in his girdle,drawing the buckle round his capacious waist more closely than he waswont to do in the lax hours of his domestic avocations.  \'And by Isis,Pisis, and Nisis, or whatever other gods there may be in Egypt, mylittle Nydia is a very Hesperides--a garden of gold to me.\'\'She sings well, and plays like a muse,\' returned Calenus; \'those arevirtues that he who employs me always pays liberally.\'\'He is a god,\' cried Burbo, enthusiastically; \'every rich man who isgenerous deserves to be worshipped.  But come, a cup of wine, oldfriend: tell me more about it.  What does she do? she is frightened,talks of her oath, and reveals nothing.\'\'Nor will I, by my right hand!  I, too, have taken that terrible oath ofsecrecy.\'\'Oath! what are oaths to men like us?\'\'True oaths of a common fashion; but this!\'--and the stalwart priestshuddered as he spoke.  \'Yet,\' he continued, in emptying a huge cup ofunmixed wine, \'I own to thee, that it is not so much the oath that Idread as the vengeance of him who proposed it.  By the gods! he is amighty sorcerer, and could draw my confession from the moon, did I dareto make it to her.  Talk no more of this.  By Pollux! wild as thosebanquets are which I enjoy with him, I am never quite at my ease there.I love, my boy, one jolly hour with thee, and one of the plain,unsophisticated, laughing girls that I meet in this chamber, allsmoke-dried though it be, better than whole nights of those magnificentdebauches.\'\'Ho! sayest thou so!  To-morrow night, please the gods, we will havethen a snug carousal.\'\'With all my heart,\' said the priest, rubbing his hands, and drawinghimself nearer to the table.At this moment they heard a slight noise at the door, as of one feelingthe handle.  The priest lowered the hood over his head.\'Tush!\' whispered the host, \'it is but the blind girl,\' as Nydia openedthe door, and entered the apartment.\'Ho! girl, and how durst thou? thou lookest pale--thou hast kept laterevels?  No matter, the young must be always the young,\' said Burbo,encouragingly.The girl made no answer, but she dropped on one of the seats with an airof lassitude.  Her color went and came rapidly: she beat the floorimpatiently with her small feet, then she suddenly raised her face, andsaid with a determined voice:\'Master, you may starve me if you will--you may beat me--you maythreaten me with death--but I will go no more to that unholy place!\'\'How, fool!\' said Burbo, in a savage voice, and his heavy brows metdarkly over his fierce and bloodshot eyes; \'how, rebellious! Take care.\'\'I have said it,\' said the poor girl, crossing her hands on her breast.\'What! my modest one, sweet vestal, thou wilt go no more!  Very well,thou shalt be carried.\'\'I will raise the city with my cries,\' said she, passionately; and thecolor mounted to her brow.\'We will take care of that too; thou shalt go gagged.\'\'Then may the gods help me!\' said Nydia, rising; \'I will appeal to themagistrates.\'\'Thine oath remember!\' said a hollow voice, as for the first timeCalenus joined in the dialogue.At these words a trembling shook the frame of the unfortunate girl; sheclasped her hands imploringly.  \'Wretch that I am!\' she cried, and burstviolently into sobs.Whether or not it was the sound of that vehement sorrow which broughtthe gentle Stratonice to the spot, her grisly form at this momentappeared in the chamber.\'How now? what hast thou been doing with my slave, brute?\' said she,angrily, to Burbo.\'Be quiet, wife,\' said he, in a tone half-sullen, half-timid; \'you wantnew girdles and fine clothes, do you?  Well then, take care of yourslave, or you may want them long.  Voe capiti tuo--vengeance on thyhead, wretched one!\'\'What is this?\' said the hag, looking from one to the other.Nydia started as by a sudden impulse from the wall against which she hadleaned: she threw herself at the feet of Stratonice; she embraced herknees, and looking up at her with those sightless but touching eyes:\'O my mistress!\' sobbed she, \'you are a woman--you have had sisters--youhave been young like me, feel for me--save me!  I will go to thosehorrible feasts no more!\'\'Stuff!\' said the hag, dragging her up rudely by one of those delicatehands, fit for no harsher labor than that of weaving the flowers whichmade her pleasure or her trade; \'stuff! these fine scruples are not forslaves.\'\'Hark ye,\' said Burbo, drawing forth his purse, and chinking itscontents: \'you hear this music, wife; by Pollux! if you do not break inyon colt with a tight rein, you will hear it no more.\'\'The girl is tired,\' said Stratonice, nodding to Calenus; \'she will bemore docile when you next want her.\'\'You! you! who is here?\' cried Nydia, casting her eyes round theapartment with so fearful and straining a survey, that Calenus rose inalarm from his seat.\'She must see with those eyes!\' muttered he.\'Who is here!  Speak, in heaven\'s name!  Ah, if you were blind like me,you would be less cruel,\' said she; and she again burst into tears.\'Take her away,\' said Burbo, impatiently; \'I hate these whimperings.\'\'Come!\' said Stratonice, pushing the poor child by the shoulders.  Nydiadrew herself aside, with an air to which resolution gave dignity.\'Hear me,\' she said; \'I have served you faithfully--I who was broughtup--Ah! my mother, my poor mother! didst thou dream I should come tothis?\' She dashed the tear from her eyes, and proceeded: \'Command me inaught else, and I will obey; but I tell you now, hard, stern, inexorableas you are--I tell you that I will go there no more; or, if I am forcedthere, that I will implore the mercy of the praetor himself--I have saidit.  Hear me, ye gods, I swear!\'The hag\'s eyes glowed with fire; she seized the child by the hair withone hand, and raised on high the other--that formidable right hand, theleast blow of which seemed capable to crush the frail and delicate formthat trembled in her grasp.  That thought itself appeared to strike her,for she suspended the blow, changed her purpose, and dragging Nydia tothe wall, seized from a hook a rope, often, alas! applied to a similarpurpose, and the next moment the shrill, the agonized shrieks of theblind girl, rang piercingly through the house.Chapter IIIGLAUCUS MAKES A PURCHASE THAT AFTERWARDS COSTS HIM DEAR.\'HOLLA, my brave fellows!\' said Lepidus, stooping his head as he enteredthe low doorway of the house of Burbo.  \'We have come to see which ofyou most honors your lanista.\' The gladiators rose from the table inrespect to three gallants known to be among the gayest and richestyouths of Pompeii, and whose voices were therefore the dispensers ofamphitheatrical reputation.\'What fine animals!\' said Clodius to Glaucus: \'worthy to be gladiators!\'\'It is a pity they are not warriors,\' returned Glaucus.A singular thing it was to see the dainty and fastidious Lepidus, whomin a banquet a ray of daylight seemed to blind--whom in the bath abreeze of air seemed to blast--in whom Nature seemed twisted andperverted from every natural impulse, and curdled into one dubious thingof effeminacy and art--a singular thing was it to see this Lepidus, nowall eagerness, and energy, and life, patting the vast shoulders of thegladiators with a blanched and girlish hand, feeling with a mincinggripe their great brawn and iron muscles, all lost in calculatingadmiration at that manhood which he had spent his life in carefullybanishing from himself.So have we seen at this day the beardless flutterers of the saloons ofLondon thronging round the heroes of the Fives-court--so have we seenthem admire, and gaze, and calculate a bet--so have we seen them meettogether, in ludicrous yet in melancholy assemblage, the two extremes ofcivilized society--the patrons of pleasure and its slaves--vilest of allslaves--at once ferocious and mercenary; male prostitutes, who selltheir strength as women their beauty; beasts in act, but baser thanbeasts in motive, for the last, at least, do not mangle themselves formoney!\'Ha! Niger, how will you fight?\' said Lepidus: \'and with whom?\'\'Sporus challenges me,\' said the grim giant; \'we shall fight to thedeath, I hope.\'\'Ah! to be sure,\' grunted Sporus, with a twinkle of his small eye.\'He takes the sword, I the net and the trident: it will be rare sport. Ihope the survivor will have enough to keep up the dignity of the crown.\'\'Never fear, we\'ll fill the purse, my Hector,\' said Clodius:\'let me see--you fight against Niger?  Glaucus, a bet--I back Niger.\'\'I told you so,\' cried Niger exultingly.  \'The noble Clodius knows me;count yourself dead already, my Sporus.\'Clodius took out his tablet.  \'A bet--ten sestertia.  What say you?\'\'So be it,\' said Glaucus.  \'But whom have we here?  I never saw thishero before\'; and he glanced at Lydon, whose limbs were slighter thanthose of his companions, and who had something of grace, and somethingeven of nobleness, in his face, which his profession had not yet whollydestroyed.\'It is Lydon, a youngster, practised only with the wooden sword as yet,\'answered Niger, condescendingly.  \'But he has the true blood in him, andhas challenged Tetraides.\'\'He challenged me,\' said Lydon: \'I accept the offer.\'\'And how do you fight?\' asked Lepidus.  \'Chut, my boy, wait a whilebefore you contend with Tetraides.\' Lydon smiled disdainfully.\'Is he a citizen or a slave?\' said Clodius.\'A citizen--we are all citizens here,\' quoth Niger.\'Stretch out your arm, my Lydon,\' said Lepidus, with the air of aconnoisseur.The gladiator, with a significant glance at his companions, extended anarm which, if not so huge in its girth as those of his comrades, was sofirm in its muscles, so beautifully symmetrical in its proportions, thatthe three visitors uttered simultaneously an admiring exclamation.\'Well, man, what is your weapon?\' said Clodius, tablet in hand.\'We are to fight first with the cestus; afterwards, if both survive,with swords,\' returned Tetraides, sharply, and with an envious scowl.\'With the cestus!\' cried Glaucus; \'there you are wrong, Lydon; thecestus is the Greek fashion: I know it well.  You should have encouragedflesh for that contest: you are far too thin for it--avoid the cestus.\'\'I cannot,\' said Lydon.\'And why?\'\'I have said--because he has challenged me.\'\'But he will not hold you to the precise weapon.\'\'My honour holds me!\' returned Lydon, proudly.\'I bet on Tetraides, two to one, at the cestus,\' said Clodius; shall itbe, Lepidus?--even betting, with swords.\'\'If you give me three to one, I will not take the odds, said Lepidus:\'Lydon will never come to the swords.  You are mighty courteous.\'\'What say you, Glaucus?\' said Clodius.\'I will take the odds three to one.\'\'Ten sestertia to thirty.\'\'Yes.\'Clodius wrote the bet in his book.\'Pardon me, noble sponsor mine,\' said Lydon, in a low voice to Glaucus:\'but how much think you the victor will gain?\'\'How much? why, perhaps seven sestertia.\'\'You are sure it will be as much?\'\'At least.  But out on you!--a Greek would have thought of the honour,and not the money.  O Italians! everywhere ye are Italians!\'A blush mantled over the bronzed cheek of the gladiator.\'Do not wrong me, noble Glaucus; I think of both, but I should neverhave been a gladiator but for the money.\'\'Base! mayest thou fall!  A miser never was a hero.\'\'I am not a miser,\' said Lydon, haughtily, and he withdrew to the otherend of the room.\'But I don\'t see Burbo; where is Burbo?  I must talk with Burbo,\' criedClodius.\'He is within,\' said Niger, pointing to the door at the extremity of theroom.\'And Stratonice, the brave old lass, where is she?\' quoth Lepidus.\'Why, she was here just before you entered; but she heard something thatdispleased her yonder, and vanished.  Pollux! old Burbo had perhapscaught hold of some girl in the back room.  I heard a female\'s voicecrying out; the old dame is as jealous as Juno.\'\'Ho! excellent!\' cried Lepidus, laughing.  \'Come, Clodius, let us goshares with Jupiter; perhaps he has caught a Leda.\'At this moment a loud cry of pain and terror startled the group.\'Oh, spare me! spare me!  I am but a child, I am blind--is not thatpunishment enough?\'\'O Pallas!  I know that voice, it is my poor flower-girl!\' exclaimedGlaucus, and he darted at once into the quarter whence the cry rose.He burst the door; he beheld Nydia writhing in the grasp of theinfuriate hag; the cord, already dabbled with blood, was raised in theair--it was suddenly arrested.\'Fury!\' said Glaucus, and with his left hand he caught Nydia from hergrasp; \'how dare you use thus a girl--one of your own sex, a child!  MyNydia, my poor infant!\'\'Oh? is that you--is that Glaucus?\' exclaimed the flower-girl, in a tonealmost of transport; the tears stood arrested on her cheek; she smiled,she clung to his breast, she kissed his robe as she clung.\'And how dare you, pert stranger! interfere between a free woman and herslave.  By the gods! despite your fine tunic and your filthy perfumes, Idoubt whether you are even a Roman citizen, my mannikin.\'\'Fair words, mistress--fair words!\' said Clodius, now entering withLepidus. \'This is my friend and sworn brother; he must be put undershelter of your tongue, sweet one; it rains stones!\'\'Give me my slave!\' shrieked the virago, placing her mighty grasp on thebreast of the Greek.\'Not if all your sister Furies could help you,\' answered Glaucus.  \'Fearnot, sweet Nydia; an Athenian never forsook distress!\'\'Holla!\' said Burbo, rising reluctantly, \'What turmoil is all this abouta slave?  Let go the young gentleman, wife--let him go: for his sake thepert thing shall be spared this once.\' So saying, he drew, or ratherdragged off, his ferocious help-mate.\'Methought when we entered,\' said Clodius, \'there was another manpresent?\'\'He is gone.\'For the priest of Isis had indeed thought it high time to vanish.\'Oh, a friend of mine! a brother cupman, a quiet dog, who does not lovethese snarlings,\' said Burbo, carelessly.  \'But go, child, you will tearthe gentleman\'s tunic if you cling to him so tight; go, you arepardoned.\'\'Oh, do not--do not forsake me!\' cried Nydia, clinging yet closer to theAthenian.Moved by her forlorn situation, her appeal to him, her own innumerableand touching graces, the Greek seated himself on one of the rude chairs.He held her on his knees--he wiped the blood from her shoulders with hislong hair--he kissed the tears from her cheeks--he whispered to her athousand of those soothing words with which we calm the grief of achild--and so beautiful did he seem in his gentle and consoling task,that even the fierce heart of Stratonice was touched.  His presenceseemed to shed light over that base and obscene haunt--young, beautiful,glorious, he was the emblem of all that earth made most happy,comforting one that earth had abandoned!\'Well, who could have thought our blind Nydia had been so honored!\' saidthe virago, wiping her heated brow.Glaucus looked up at Burbo.\'My good man,\' said he, \'this is your slave; she sings well, she isaccustomed to the care of flowers--I wish to make a present of such aslave to a lady.  Will you sell her to me?\' As he spoke he felt thewhole frame of the poor girl tremble with delight; she started up, sheput her disheveled hair from her eyes, she looked around, as if, alas,she had the power to see!\'Sell our Nydia! no, indeed,\' said Stratonice, gruffly.Nydia sank back with a long sigh, and again clasped the robe of herprotector.\'Nonsense!\' said Clodius, imperiously: \'you must oblige me. What, man!what, old dame! offend me, and your trade is ruined.  Is not Burbo mykinsman Pansa\'s client?  Am I not the oracle of the amphitheatre and itsheroes?  If I say the word, break up your wine-jars--you sell no more.Glaucus, the slave is yours.\'Burbo scratched his huge head, in evident embarrassment.\'The girl is worth her weight in gold to me.\'\'Name your price, I am rich,\' said Glaucus.The ancient Italians were like the modern, there was nothing they wouldnot sell, much less a poor blind girl.\'I paid six sestertia for her, she is worth twelve now,\' mutteredStratonice.\'You shall have twenty; come to the magistrates at once, and then to myhouse for your money.\'\'I would not have sold the dear girl for a hundred but to oblige nobleClodius,\' said Burbo, whiningly.  \'And you will speak to Pansa about theplace of designator at the amphitheatre, noble Clodius? it would justsuit me.\'\'Thou shalt have it,\' said Clodius; adding in a whisper to Burbo, \'YonGreek can make your fortune; money runs through him like a sieve: markto-day with white chalk, my Priam.\'\'An dabis?\' said Glaucus, in the formal question of sale and barter.\'Dabitur,\' answered Burbo.\'Then, then, I am to go with you--with you?  O happiness!\' murmuredNydia.\'Pretty one, yes; and thy hardest task henceforth shall be to sing thyGrecian hymns to the loveliest lady in Pompeii.\'The girl sprang from his clasp; a change came over her whole face,bright the instant before; she sighed heavily, and then once more takinghis hand, she said:\'I thought I was to go to your house?\'\'And so thou shalt for the present; come, we lose time.\'Chapter IVTHE RIVAL OF GLAUCUS PRESSES ONWARD IN THE RACE.IONE was one of those brilliant characters which, but once or twice,flash across our career.  She united in the highest perfection therarest of earthly gifts--Genius and Beauty.  No one ever possessedsuperior intellectual qualities without knowing them--the alliterationof modesty and merit is pretty enough, but where merit is great, theveil of that modesty you admire never disguises its extent from itspossessor.  It is the proud consciousness of certain qualities that itcannot reveal to the everyday world, that gives to genius that shy, andreserved, and troubled air, which puzzles and flatters you when youencounter it.Ione, then, knew her genius; but, with that charming versatility thatbelongs of right to women, she had the faculty so few of a kindredgenius in the less malleable sex can claim--the faculty to bend andmodel her graceful intellect to all whom it encountered. The sparklingfountain threw its waters alike upon the strand, the cavern, and theflowers; it refreshed, it smiled, it dazzled everywhere.  That pride,which is the necessary result of superiority, she wore easily--in herbreast it concentred itself in independence.  She pursued thus her ownbright and solitary path.  She asked no aged matron to direct and guideher--she walked alone by the torch of her own unflickering purity.  Sheobeyed no tyrannical and absolute custom.  She moulded custom to her ownwill, but this so delicately and with so feminine a grace, so perfect anexemption from error, that you could not say she outraged custom butcommanded it.  The wealth of her graces was inexhaustible--shebeautified the commonest action; a word, a look from her, seemed magic.Love her, and you entered into a new world, you passed from this triteand commonplace earth.  You were in a land in which your eyes saweverything through an enchanted medium.  In her presence you felt as iflistening to exquisite music; you were steeped in that sentiment whichhas so little of earth in it, and which music so well inspires--thatintoxication which refines and exalts, which seizes, it is true, thesenses, but gives them the character of the soul.She was peculiarly formed, then, to command and fascinate the lessordinary and the bolder natures of men; to love her was to unite twopassions, that of love and of ambition--you aspired when you adored her.It was no wonder that she had completely chained and subdued themysterious but burning soul of the Egyptian, a man in whom dwelt thefiercest passions.  Her beauty and her soul alike enthralled him.Set apart himself from the common world, he loved that daringness ofcharacter which also made itself, among common things, aloof and alone.He did not, or he would not see, that that very isolation put her yetmore from him than from the vulgar.  Far as the poles--far as the nightfrom day, his solitude was divided from hers.  He was solitary from hisdark and solemn vices--she from her beautiful fancies and her purity ofvirtue.If it was not strange that Ione thus enthralled the Egyptian, far lessstrange was it that she had captured, as suddenly as irrevocably,  thebright and sunny heart of the Athenian.  The gladness of a temperamentwhich seemed woven from the beams of light had led Glaucus intopleasure.  He obeyed no more vicious dictates when he wandered into thedissipations of his time, than the exhilarating voices of youth andhealth.  He threw the brightness of his nature over every abyss andcavern through which he strayed.  His imagination dazzled him, but hisheart never was corrupted. Of far more penetration than his companionsdeemed, he saw that they sought to prey upon his riches and his youth:but he despised wealth save as the means of enjoyment, and youth was thegreat sympathy that united him to them.  He felt, it is true, theimpulse of nobler thoughts and higher aims than in pleasure could beindulged: but the world was one vast prison, to which the Sovereign ofRome was the Imperial gaoler; and the very virtues, which in the freedays of Athens would have made him ambitious, in the slavery of earthmade him inactive and supine.  For in that unnatural and bloatedcivilization, all that was noble in emulation was forbidden. Ambition inthe regions of a despotic and luxurious court was but the contest offlattery and craft.  Avarice had become the sole ambition--men desiredpraetorships and provinces only as the license to pillage, andgovernment was but the excuse of rapine.  It is in small states thatglory is most active and pure--the more confined the limits of thecircle, the more ardent the patriotism.  In small states, opinion isconcentrated and strong--every eye reads your actions--your publicmotives are blended with your private ties--every spot in your narrowsphere is crowded with forms familiar since your childhood--the applauseof your citizens is like the caresses of your friends.  But in largestates, the city is but the court: the provinces--unknown to you,unfamiliar in customs, perhaps in language--have no claim on yourpatriotism, the ancestry of their inhabitants is not yours.  In thecourt you desire favor instead of glory; at a distance from the court,public opinion has vanished from you, and self-interest has nocounterpoise.Italy, Italy, while I write, your skies are over me--your seas flowbeneath my feet, listen not to the blind policy which would unite allyour crested cities, mourning for their republics, into one empire;false, pernicious delusion! your only hope of regeneration is indivision.  Florence, Milan, Venice, Genoa, may be free once more, ifeach is free.  But dream not of freedom for the whole while you enslavethe parts; the heart must be the centre of the system, the blood mustcirculate freely everywhere; and in vast communities you behold but abloated and feeble giant, whose brain is imbecile, whose limbs are dead,and who pays in disease and weakness the penalty of transcending thenatural proportions of health and vigour.Thus thrown back upon themselves, the more ardent qualities of Glaucusfound no vent, save in that overflowing imagination which gave grace topleasure, and poetry to thought.  Ease was less despicable thancontention with parasites and slaves, and luxury could yet be refinedthough ambition could not be ennobled.  But all that was best andbrightest in his soul woke at once when he knew Ione.  Here was anempire, worthy of demigods to attain; here was a glory, which thereeking smoke of a foul society could not soil or dim.  Love, in everytime, in every state, can thus find space for its golden altars. Andtell me if there ever, even in the ages most favorable to glory, couldbe a triumph more exalted and elating than the conquest of one nobleheart?And whether it was that this sentiment inspired him, his ideas glowedmore brightly, his soul seemed more awake and more visible, in Ione\'spresence. If natural to love her, it was natural that she should returnthe passion. Young, brilliant, eloquent, enamoured, and Athenian, he wasto her as the incarnation of the poetry of her father\'s land.  They werenot like creatures of a world in which strife and sorrow are theelements; they were like things to be seen only in the holiday ofnature, so glorious and so fresh were their youth, their beauty, andtheir love.  They seemed out of place in the harsh and every-day earth;they belonged of right to the Saturnian age, and the dreams of demigodand nymph.  It was as if the poetry of life gathered and fed itself inthem, and in their hearts were concentrated the last rays of the sun ofDelos and of Greece.But if Ione was independent in her choice of life, so was her modestpride proportionably vigilant and easily alarmed.  The falsehood of theEgyptian was invented by a deep knowledge of her nature.  The story ofcoarseness, of indelicacy, in Glaucus, stung her to the quick.  She feltit a reproach upon her character and her career, a punishment above allto her love; she felt, for the first time, how suddenly she had yieldedto that love; she blushed with shame at a weakness, the extent of whichshe was startled to perceive: she imagined it was that weakness whichhad incurred the contempt of Glaucus; she endured the bitterest curse ofnoble natures--humiliation!  Yet her love, perhaps, was no less alarmedthan her pride.  If one moment she murmured reproaches upon Glaucus--ifone moment she renounced, she almost hated him--at the next she burstinto passionate tears, her heart yielded to its softness, and she saidin the bitterness of anguish, \'He despises me--he does not love me.\'From the hour the Egyptian had left her she had retired to her mostsecluded chamber, she had shut out her handmaids, she had denied herselfto the crowds that besieged her door.  Glaucus was excluded with therest; he wondered, but he guessed not why!  He never attributed to hisIone--his queen--his goddess--that woman-like caprice of which thelove-poets of Italy so unceasingly complain.  He imagined her, in themajesty of her candour, above all the arts that torture.  He wastroubled, but his hopes were not dimmed, for he knew already that heloved and was beloved; what more could he desire as an amulet againstfear?At deepest night, then, when the streets were hushed, and the high moononly beheld his devotions, he stole to that temple of his heart--herhome; and wooed her after the beautiful fashion of his country.  Hecovered her threshold with the richest garlands, in which every flowerwas a volume of sweet passion; and he charmed the long summer night withthe sound of the Lydian lute: and verses, which the inspiration of themoment sufficed to weave.But the window above opened not; no smile made yet more holy the shiningair of night.  All was still and dark.  He knew not if his verse waswelcome and his suit was heard.Yet Ione slept not, nor disdained to hear.  Those soft strains ascendedto her chamber; they soothed, they subdued her.  While she listened, shebelieved nothing against her lover; but when they were stilled at last,and his step departed, the spell ceased; and, in the bitterness of hersoul, she almost conceived in that delicate flattery a new affront.I said she was denied to all; but there was one exception, there was oneperson who would not be denied, assuming over her actions and her housesomething like the authority of a parent; Arbaces, for himself, claimedan exemption from all the ceremonies observed by others.  He entered thethreshold with the license of one who feels that he is privileged and athome.  He made his way to her solitude and with that sort of quiet andunapologetic air which seemed to consider the right as a thing ofcourse. With all the independence of Ione\'s character, his heart hadenabled him to obtain a secret and powerful control over her mind.  Shecould not shake it off; sometimes she desired to do so; but she neveractively struggled against it.  She was fascinated by his serpent eye.He arrested, he commanded her, by the magic of a mind long accustomed toawe and to subdue. Utterly unaware of his real character or his hiddenlove, she felt for him the reverence which genius feels for wisdom, andvirtue for sanctity.  She regarded him as one of those mighty sages ofold, who attained to the mysteries of knowledge by an exemption from thepassions of their kind.  She scarcely considered him as a being, likeherself, of the earth, but as an oracle at once dark and sacred.  Shedid not love him, but she feared.  His presence was unwelcome to her; itdimmed her spirit even in its brightest mood; he seemed, with hischilling and lofty aspect, like some eminence which casts a shadow overthe sun.  But she never thought of forbidding his visits.  She waspassive under the influence which created in her breast, not therepugnance, but something of the stillness of terror.Arbaces himself now resolved to exert all his arts to possess himself ofthat treasure he so burningly coveted.  He was cheered and elated by hisconquests over her brother.  From the hour in which Apaecides fellbeneath the voluptuous sorcery of that fete which we have described, hefelt his empire over the young priest triumphant and insured.  He knewthat there is no victim so thoroughly subdued as a young and fervent manfor the first time delivered to the thraldom of the senses.When Apaecides recovered, with the morning light, from the profoundsleep which succeeded to the delirium of wonder and of pleasure, he was,it is true, ashamed--terrified--appalled.  His vows of austerity andcelibacy echoed in his ear; his thirst after holiness--had it beenquenched at so unhallowed a stream?  But Arbaces knew well the means bywhich to confirm his conquest.  From the arts of pleasure he led theyoung priest at once to those of his mysterious wisdom.  He bared to hisamazed eyes the initiatory secrets of the sombre philosophy of theNile--those secrets plucked from the stars, and the wild chemistry,which, in those days, when Reason herself was but the creature ofImagination, might well pass for the lore of a diviner magic.  He seemedto the young eyes of the priest as a being above mortality, and endowedwith supernatural gifts.  That yearning and intense desire for theknowledge which is not of earth--which had burned from his boyhood inthe heart of the priest--was dazzled, until it confused and mastered hisclearer sense. He gave himself to the art which thus addressed at oncethe two strongest of human passions, that of pleasure and that ofknowledge. He was loth to believe that one so wise could err, that oneso lofty could stoop to deceive.  Entangled in the dark web ofmetaphysical moralities, he caught at the excuse by which the Egyptianconverted vice into a virtue.  His pride was insensibly flattered thatArbaces had deigned to rank him with himself, to set him apart from thelaws which bound the vulgar, to make him an august participator, both inthe mystic studies and the magic fascinations of the Egyptian\'ssolitude.  The pure and stern lessons of that creed to which Olinthushad sought to make him convert, were swept away from his memory by thedeluge of new passions. And the Egyptian, who was versed in the articlesof that true faith, and who soon learned from his pupil the effect whichhad been produced upon him by its believers, sought, not unskilfully, toundo that effect, by a tone of reasoning, half-sarcastic andhalf-earnest.\'This faith,\' said he, \'is but a borrowed plagiarism from one of themany allegories invented by our priests of old.  Observe,\' he added,pointing to a hieroglyphical scroll--\'observe in these ancient figuresthe origin of the Christian\'s Trinity.  Here are also three gods--theDeity, the Spirit, and the Son.  Observe, that the epithet of the Son is""Saviour""--observe, that the sign by which his human qualities aredenoted is the cross.\' Note here, too, the mystic history of Osiris, howhe put on death; how he lay in the grave; and how, thus fulfilling asolemn atonement, he rose again from the dead!  In these stories we butdesign to paint an allegory from the operations of nature and theevolutions of the eternal heavens.  But the allegory unknown, the typesthemselves have furnished to credulous nations the materials of manycreeds.  They have travelled to the vast plains of India; they havemixed themselves up in the visionary speculations of the Greek; becomingmore and more gross and embodied, as they emerge farther from theshadows of their antique origin, they have assumed a human and palpableform in this novel faith; and the believers of Galilee are but theunconscious repeaters of one of the superstitions of the Nile!\'This was the last argument which completely subdued the priest.  It wasnecessary to him, as to all, to believe in something; and undivided and,at last, unreluctant, he surrendered himself to that belief whichArbaces inculcated, and which all that was human in passion--all thatwas flattering in vanity--all that was alluring in pleasure, served toinvite to, and contributed to confirm.This conquest, thus easily made, the Egyptian could now give himselfwholly up to the pursuit of a far dearer and mightier object; and hehailed, in his success with the brother, an omen of his triumph over thesister.He had seen Ione on the day following the revel we have witnessed; andwhich was also the day after he had poisoned her mind against his rival.The next day, and the next, he saw her also: and each time he laidhimself out with consummate art, partly to confirm her impressionagainst Glaucus, and principally to prepare her for the impressions hedesired her to receive. The proud Ione took care to conceal the anguishshe endured; and the pride of woman has an hypocrisy which can deceivethe most penetrating, and shame the most astute.  But Arbaces was noless cautious not to recur to a subject which he felt it was mostpolitic to treat as of the lightest importance. He knew that by dwellingmuch upon the fault of a rival, you only give him dignity in the eyes ofyour mistress: the wisest plan is, neither loudly to hate, nor bitterlyto contemn; the wisest plan is to lower him by an indifference of tone,as if you could not dream that he could be loved. Your safety is inconcealing the wound to your own pride, and imperceptibly alarming thatof the umpire, whose voice is fate!  Such, in all times, will be thepolicy of one who knows the science of the sex--it was now theEgyptian\'s.He recurred no more, then, to the presumption of Glaucus; he mentionedhis name, but not more often than that of Clodius or of Lepidus.  Heaffected to class them together as things of a low and ephemeralspecies; as things wanting nothing of the butterfly, save its innocenceand its grace. Sometimes he slightly alluded to some invented debauch,in which he declared them companions; sometimes he adverted to them asthe antipodes of those lofty and spiritual natures, to whose order thatof Ione belonged.  Blinded alike by the pride of Ione, and, perhaps, byhis own, he dreamed not that she already loved; but he dreaded lest shemight have formed for Glaucus the first fluttering prepossessions thatlead to love.  And, secretly, he ground his teeth in rage and jealousy,when he reflected on the youth, the fascinations, and the brilliancy ofthat formidable rival whom he pretended to undervalue.It was on the fourth day from the date of the close of the previousbook, that Arbaces and Ione sat together.\'You wear your veil at home,\' said the Egyptian; \'that is not fair tothose whom you honour with your friendship.\'\'But to Arbaces,\' answered Ione, who, indeed, had cast the veil over herfeatures to conceal eyes red with weeping--\'to Arbaces, who looks onlyto the mind, what matters it that the face is concealed?\'\'I do look only to the mind,\' replied the Egyptian: \'show me then yourface--for there I shall see it.\'\'You grow gallant in the air of Pompeii,\' said Ione, with a forced toneof gaiety.\'Do you think, fair Ione, that it is only at Pompeii that I have learnedto value you?\' The Egyptian\'s voice trembled--he paused for a moment,and then resumed.\'There is a love, beautiful Greek, which is not the love only of thethoughtless and the young--there is a love which sees not with the eyes,which hears not with the ears; but in which soul is enamoured of soul.The countryman of thy ancestors, the cave-nursed Plato, dreamed of sucha love--his followers have sought to imitate it; but it is a love thatis not for the herd to echo--it is a love that only high and noblenatures can conceive--it hath nothing in common with the sympathies andties of coarse affection--wrinkles do not revolt it--homeliness offeature does not deter; it asks youth, it is true, but it asks it onlyin the freshness of the emotions; it asks beauty, it is true, but it isthe beauty of the thought and of the spirit.  Such is the love, O Ione,which is a worthy offering to thee from the cold and the austere.Austere and cold thou deemest me--such is the love that I venture to layupon thy shrine--thou canst receive it without a blush.\'\'And its name is friendship!\' replied Ione: her answer was innocent, yetit sounded like the reproof of one conscious of the design of thespeaker.\'Friendship!\' said Arbaces, vehemently.  \'No; that is a word too oftenprofaned to apply to a sentiment so sacred.  Friendship! it is a tiethat binds fools and profligates! Friendship! it is the bond that unitesthe frivolous hearts of a Glaucus and a Clodius! Friendship! no, that isan affection of earth, of vulgar habits and sordid sympathies; thefeeling of which I speak is borrowed from the stars\'--it partakes ofthat mystic and ineffable yearning, which we feel when we gaze onthem--it burns, yet it purifies--it is the lamp of naphtha in thealabaster vase, glowing with fragrant odorous, but shining only throughthe purest vessels.  No; it is not love, and it is not friendship, thatArbaces feels for Ione.  Give it no name--earth has no name for it--itis not of earth--why debase it with earthly epithets and earthlyassociations?\'Never before had Arbaces ventured so far, yet he felt his ground step bystep: he knew that he uttered a language which, if at this day ofaffected platonisms it would speak unequivocally to the ears of beauty,was at that time strange and unfamiliar, to which no precise idea couldbe attached, from which he could imperceptibly advance or recede, asoccasion suited, as hope encouraged or fear deterred. Ione trembled,though she knew not why; her veil hid her features, and masked anexpression, which, if seen by the Egyptian, would have at once dampedand enraged him; in fact, he never was more displeasing to her--theharmonious modulation of the most suasive voice that ever disguisedunhallowed thought fell discordantly on her ear.  Her whole soul wasstill filled with the image of Glaucus; and the accent of tendernessfrom another only revolted and dismayed; yet she did not conceive thatany passion more ardent than that platonism which Arbaces expressedlurked beneath his words.  She thought that he, in truth, spoke only ofthe affection and sympathy of the soul; but was it not precisely thataffection and that sympathy which had made a part of those emotions shefelt for Glaucus; and could any other footstep than his approach thehaunted adytum of her heart?Anxious at once to change the conversation, she replied, therefore, witha cold and indifferent voice, \'Whomsoever Arbaces honors with thesentiment of esteem, it is natural that his elevated wisdom should colorthat sentiment with its own hues; it is natural that his friendshipshould be purer than that of others, whose pursuits and errors he doesnot deign to share.  But tell me, Arbaces, hast thou seen my brother oflate?  He has not visited me for several days; and when I last saw himhis manner disturbed and alarmed me much.  I fear lest he was tooprecipitate in the severe choice that he has adopted, and that herepents an irrevocable step.\'\'Be cheered, Ione,\' replied the Egyptian.  \'It is true that, some littletime since he was troubled and sad of spirit; those doubts beset himwhich were likely to haunt one of that fervent temperament, which everebbs and flows, and vibrates between excitement and exhaustion.  But he,Ione, he came to me his anxieties and his distress; he sought one whopitied me and loved him; I have calmed his mind--I have removed hisdoubts--I have taken him from the threshold of Wisdom into its temple;and before the majesty of the goddess his soul is hushed and soothed.Fear not, he will repent no more; they who trust themselves to Arbacesnever repent but for a moment.\'\'You rejoice me,\' answered Ione.  \'My dear brother! in his contentment Iam happy.\'The conversation then turned upon lighter subjects; the Egyptian exertedhimself to please, he condescended even to entertain; the vast varietyof his knowledge enabled him to adorn and light up every subject onwhich he touched; and Ione, forgetting the displeasing effect of hisformer words, was carried away, despite her sadness, by the magic of hisintellect.  Her manner became unrestrained and her language fluent; andArbaces, who had waited his opportunity, now hastened to seize it.\'You have never seen,\' said he, \'the interior of my home; it may amuseyou to do so: it contains some rooms that may explain to you what youhave often asked me to describe--the fashion of an Egyptian house; notindeed, that you will perceive in the poor and minute proportions ofRoman architecture the massive strength, the vast space, the giganticmagnificence, or even the domestic construction of the palaces of Thebesand Memphis; but something there is, here and there, that may serve toexpress to you some notion of that antique civilization which hashumanized the world.  Devote, then, to the austere friend of your youth,one of these bright summer evenings, and let me boast that my gloomymansion has been honored with the presence of the admired Ione.\'Unconscious of the pollutions of the mansion, of the danger that awaitedher, Ione readily assented to the proposal.  The next evening was fixedfor the visit; and the Egyptian, with a serene countenance, and a heartbeating with fierce and unholy joy, departed. Scarce had he gone, whenanother visitor claimed admission....  But now we return to Glaucus.Chapter VTHE POOR TORTOISE.  NEW CHANGES FOR NYDIA.THE morning sun shone over the small and odorous garden enclosed withinthe peristyle of the house of the Athenian.  He lay reclined, sad andlistlessly, on the smooth grass which intersected the viridarium; and aslight canopy stretched above, broke the fierce rays of the summer sun.When that fairy mansion was first disinterred from the earth they foundin the garden the shell of a tortoise that had been its inmate.  Thatanimal, so strange a link in the creation, to which Nature seems to havedenied all the pleasure of life, save life\'s passive and dream-likeperception, had been the guest of the place for years before Glaucuspurchased it; for years, indeed which went beyond the memory of man, andto which tradition assigned an almost incredible date.  The househad been built and rebuilt--its possessors had changed andfluctuated--generations had flourished and decayed--and still thetortoise dragged on its slow and unsympathizing existence.  In theearthquake, which sixteen years before had overthrown many of the publicbuildings of the city, and scared away the amazed inhabitants, the housenow inhabited by Glaucus had been terribly shattered.  The possessorsdeserted it for many days; on their return they cleared away the ruinswhich encumbered the viridarium, and found still the tortoise, unharmedand unconscious of the surrounding destruction.  It seemed to bear acharmed life in its languid blood and imperceptible motions; yet it wasnot so inactive as it seemed: it held a regular and monotonous course;inch by inch it traversed the little orbit of its domain, taking monthsto accomplish the whole gyration.  It was a restless voyager, thattortoise!--patiently, and with pain, did it perform its self-appointedjourneys, evincing no interest in the things around it--a philosopherconcentrated in itself.  There was something grand in its solitaryselfishness!--the sun in which it basked--the waters poured daily overit--the air, which it insensibly inhaled, were its sole and unfailingluxuries.  The mild changes of the season, in that lovely clime,affected it not.  It covered itself with its shell--as the saint in hispiety--as the sage in his wisdom--as the lover in his hope.It was impervious to the shocks and mutations of time--it was an emblemof time itself: slow, regular, perpetual; unwitting of the passions thatfret themselves around--of the wear and tear of mortality.  The poortortoise! nothing less than the bursting of volcanoes, the convulsionsof the riven world, could have quenched its sluggish spark!  Theinexorable Death, that spared not pomp or beauty, passed unheedingly bya thing to which death could bring so insignificant a change.For this animal the mercurial and vivid Greek felt all the wonder andaffection of contrast.  He could spend hours in surveying its creepingprogress, in moralizing over its mechanism.  He despised it in joy--heenvied it in sorrow.Regarding it now as he lay along the sward--its dull mass moving whileit seemed motionless, the Athenian murmured to himself:\'The eagle dropped a stone from his talons, thinking to break thy shell:the stone crushed the head of a poet.  This is the allegory of Fate!Dull thing!  Thou hadst a father and a mother; perhaps, ages ago, thouthyself hadst a mate.  Did thy parents love, or didst thou?  Did thyslow blood circulate more gladly when thou didst creep to the side ofthy wedded one? Wert thou capable of affection? Could it distress theeif she were away from thy side?  Couldst thou feel when she was present?What would I not give to know the history of thy mailed breast--to gazeupon the mechanism of thy faint desires--to mark what hair-breadthdifference separates thy sorrow from thy joy!  Yet, methinks, thouwouldst know if Ione were present!  Thou wouldst feel her coming like ahappier air--like a gladder sun.  I envy thee now, for thou knowest notthat she is absent; and I--would I could be like thee--between theintervals of seeing her!  What doubt, what presentiment, haunts me! whywill she not admit me?  Days have passed since I heard her voice.  Forthe first time, life grows flat to me.  I am as one who is left alone ata banquet, the lights dead, and the flowers faded.  Ah! Ione, couldstthou dream how I adore thee!\'From these enamoured reveries, Glaucus was interrupted by the entranceof Nydia.  She came with her light, though cautious step, along themarble tablinum.  She passed the portico, and paused at the flowerswhich bordered the garden.  She had her water-vase in her hand, and shesprinkled the thirsting plants, which seemed to brighten at herapproach.  She bent to inhale their odor.  She touched them timidly andcaressingly.  She felt, along their stems, if any withered leaf orcreeping insect marred their beauty.  And as she hovered from flower toflower, with her earnest and youthful countenance and graceful motions,you could not have imagined a fitter handmaid for the goddess of thegarden.\'Nydia, my child!\' said Glaucus.At the sound of his voice she paused at once--listening, blushing,breathless; with her lips parted, her face upturned to catch thedirection of the sound, she laid down the vase--she hastened to him; andwonderful it was to see how unerringly she threaded her dark way throughthe flowers, and came by the shortest path to the side of her new lord.\'Nydia,\' said Glaucus, tenderly stroking back her long and beautifulhair, \'it is now three days since thou hast been under the protection ofmy household gods.  Have they smiled on thee?  Art thou happy?\'\'Ah! so happy!\' sighed the slave.\'And now,\' continued Glaucus, \'that thou hast recovered somewhat fromthe hateful recollections of thy former state,--and now that they havefitted thee (touching her broidered tunic) with garments more meet forthy delicate shape--and now, sweet child, that thou hast accustomedthyself to a happiness, which may the gods grant thee ever! I am aboutto pray at thy hands a boon.\'\'Oh! what can I do for thee?\' said Nydia, clasping her hands.\'Listen,\' said Glaucus, \'and young as thou art, thou shalt be myconfidant. Hast thou ever heard the name of Ione?\'The blind girl gasped for breath, and turning pale as one of the statueswhich shone upon them from the peristyle, she answered with an effort,and after a moment\'s pause:\'Yes!  I have heard that she is of Neapolis, and beautiful.\'\'Beautiful! her beauty is a thing to dazzle the day!  Neapolis! nay, sheis Greek by origin; Greece only could furnish forth such shapes.  Nydia,I love her!\'\'I thought so,\' replied Nydia, calmly.\'I love, and thou shalt tell her so.  I am about to send thee to her.Happy Nydia, thou wilt be in her chamber--thou wilt drink the music ofher voice--thou wilt bask in the sunny air of her presence!\'\'What! what! wilt thou send me from thee?\'\'Thou wilt go to Ione,\' answered Glaucus, in a tone that said, \'Whatmore canst thou desire?\'Nydia burst into tears.Glaucus, raising himself, drew her towards him with the soothingcaresses of a brother.\'My child, my Nydia, thou weepest in ignorance of the happiness I bestowon thee.  She is gentle, and kind, and soft as the breeze of spring. Shewill be a sister to thy youth--she will appreciate thy winningtalents--she will love thy simple graces as none other could, for theyare like her own. Weepest thou still, fond fool?  I will not force thee,sweet. Wilt thou not do for me this kindness?\'\'Well, if I can serve thee, command.  See, I weep no longer--I am calm.\'\'That is my own Nydia,\' continued Glaucus, kissing her hand. \'Go, then,to her: if thou art disappointed in her kindness--if I have deceivedthee, return when thou wilt.  I do not give thee to another; I but lend.My home ever be thy refuge, sweet one.  Ah! would it could shelter allthe friendless and distressed!  But if my heart whispers truly, I shallclaim thee again soon, my child.  My home and Ione\'s will become thesame, and thou shalt dwell with both.\'A shiver passed through the slight frame of the blind girl, but she weptno more--she was resigned.\'Go, then, my Nydia, to Ione\'s house--they shall show thee the way. Takeher the fairest flowers thou canst pluck; the vase which contains them Iwill give thee: thou must excuse its unworthiness.  Thou shalt take,too, with thee the lute that I gave thee yesterday, and from which thouknowest so well to awaken the charming spirit.  Thou shalt give her,also, this letter, in which, after a hundred efforts, I have embodiedsomething of my thoughts. Let thy ear catch every accent, everymodulation of her voice, and tell me, when we meet again, if its musicshould flatter me or discourage.  It is now, Nydia, some days since Ihave been admitted to Ione; there is something mysterious in thisexclusion.  I am distracted with doubts and fears; learn--for thou artquick, and thy care for me will sharpen tenfold thy acuteness--learn thecause of this unkindness; speak of me as often as thou canst; let myname come ever to thy lips: insinuate how I love rather than proclaimit; watch if she sighs whilst thou speakest, if she answer thee; or, ifshe reproves, in what accents she reproves.  Be my friend, plead for me:and oh! how vastly wilt thou overpay the little I have done for thee!Thou comprehendest, Nydia; thou art yet a child--have I said more thanthou canst understand?\'\'No.\'\'And thou wilt serve me?\'\'Yes.\'\'Come to me when thou hast gathered the flowers, and I will give theethe vase I speak of; seek me in the chamber of Leda.  Pretty one, thoudost not grieve now?\'\'Glaucus, I am a slave; what business have I with grief or joy?\'\'Sayest thou so?  No, Nydia, be free.  I give thee freedom; enjoy it asthou wilt, and pardon me that I reckoned on thy desire to serve me.\'\'You are offended.  Oh! I would not, for that which no freedom can give,offend you, Glaucus.  My guardian, my saviour, my protector, forgive thepoor blind girl!  She does not grieve even in leaving thee, if she cancontribute to thy happiness.\'\'May the gods bless this grateful heart!\' said Glaucus, greatly moved;and, unconscious of the fires he excited, he repeatedly kissed herforehead.\'Thou forgivest me,\' said she, \'and thou wilt talk no more of freedom;my happiness is to be thy slave: thou hast promised thou wilt not giveme to another...\'\'I have promised.\'\'And now, then, I will gather the flowers.\'Silently, Nydia took from the hand of Glaucus the costly and jewelledvase, in which the flowers vied with each other in hue and fragrance;tearlessly she received his parting admonition.  She paused for a momentwhen his voice ceased--she did not trust herself to reply--she soughthis hand--she raised it to her lips, dropped her veil over her face, andpassed at once from his presence.  She paused again as she reached thethreshold; she stretched her hands towards it, and murmured:\'Three happy days--days of unspeakable delight, have I known since Ipassed thee--blessed threshold! may peace dwell ever with thee when I amgone!  And now, my heart tears itself from thee, and the only sound itutters bids me--die!\'Chapter VITHE HAPPY BEAUTY AND THE BLIND SLAVE.A SLAVE entered the chamber of Ione.  A messenger from Glaucus desiredto be admitted.Ione hesitated an instant.\'She is blind, that messenger,\' said the slave; \'she will do hercommission to none but thee.\'Base is that heart which does not respect affliction!  The moment sheheard the messenger was blind, Ione felt the impossibility of returninga chilling reply.  Glaucus had chosen a herald that was indeed sacred--aherald that could not be denied.\'What can he want with me? what message can he send?\' and the heart ofIone beat quick.  The curtain across the door was withdrawn; a soft andecholess step fell upon the marble; and Nydia, led by one of theattendants, entered with her precious gift.She stood still a moment, as if listening for some sound that mightdirect her.\'Will the noble Ione,\' said she, in a soft and low voice, \'deign tospeak, that I may know whither to steer these benighted steps, and thatI may lay my offerings at her feet?\'\'Fair child,\' said Ione, touched and soothingly, \'give not thyself thepain to cross these slippery floors, my attendant will bring to me whatthou hast to present\'; and she motioned to the handmaid to take thevase.\'I may give these flowers to none but thee,\' answered Nydia; and, guidedby her ear, she walked slowly to the place where Ione sat, and kneelingwhen she came before her, proffered the vase.Ione took it from her hand, and placed it on the table at her side.  Shethen raised her gently, and would have seated her on the couch, but thegirl modestly resisted.\'I have not yet discharged my office,\' said she; and she drew the letterof Glaucus from her vest.  \'This will, perhaps, explain why he who sentme chose so unworthy a messenger to Ione.\'The Neapolitan took the letter with a hand, the trembling of which Nydiaat once felt and sighed to feel.  With folded arms, and downcast looks,she stood before the proud and stately form of Ione--no less proud,perhaps, in her attitude of submission.  Ione waved her hand, and theattendants withdrew; she gazed again upon the form of the young slave insurprise and beautiful compassion; then, retiring a little from her, sheopened and read the following letter:\'Glaucus to Ione sends more than he dares to utter.  Is Ione ill? thyslaves tell me ""No"", and that assurance comforts me.  Has Glaucusoffended Ione?--ah! that question I may not ask from them.  For fivedays I have been banished from thy presence.  Has the sun shone?--I knowit not.  Has the sky smiled?--it has had no smile for me.  My sun and mysky are Ione.  Do I offend thee?  Am I too bold?  Do I say that on thetablet which my tongue has hesitated to breathe?  Alas! it is in thineabsence that I feel most the spells by which thou hast subdued me.  Andabsence, that deprives me of joy, brings me courage.  Thou wilt not seeme; thou hast banished also the common flatterers that flock aroundthee.  Canst thou confound me with them?  It is not possible! Thouknowest too well that I am not of them--that their clay is not mine. Foreven were I of the humblest mould, the fragrance of the rose haspenetrated me, and the spirit of thy nature hath passed within me, toembalm, to sanctify, to inspire.  Have they slandered me to thee, Ione?Thou wilt not believe them.  Did the Delphic oracle itself tell me thouwert unworthy, I would not believe it; and am I less incredulous thanthou I think of the last time we met--of the song which I sang tothee--of the look that thou gavest me in return. Disguise it as thou wilt,Ione, there is something kindred between us, and our eyes acknowledgedit, though our lips were silent.  Deign to see me, to listen to me, andafter that exclude me if thou wilt.  I meant not so soon to say I loved.But those words rush to my heart--they will have way.  Accept, then, myhomage and my vows.  We met first at the shrine of Pallas; shall we notmeet before a softer and a more ancient altar?\'Beautiful! adored Ione!  If my hot youth and my Athenian blood havemisguided and allured me, they have but taught my wanderings toappreciate the rest--the haven they have attained.  I hang up mydripping robes on the Sea-god\'s shrine.  I have escaped shipwreck.  Ihave found THEE.  Ione, deign to see me; thou art gentle to strangers,wilt thou be less merciful to those of thine own land?  I await thyreply.  Accept the flowers which I send--their sweet breath has alanguage more eloquent than words.  They take from the sun the odorousthey return--they are the emblem of the love that receives and repaystenfold--the emblem of the heart that drunk thy rays, and owes to theethe germ of the treasures that it proffers to thy smile.  I send theseby one whom thou wilt receive for her own sake, if not for mine. She,like us, is a stranger; her fathers\' ashes lie under brighter skies:but, less happy than we, she is blind and a slave.  Poor Nydia!  I seekas much as possible to repair to her the cruelties of Nature and ofFate, in asking permission to place her with thee.  She is gentle,quick, and docile. She is skilled in music and the song; and she is avery Chloris to the flowers.  She thinks, Ione, that thou wilt love her:if thou dost not, send her back to me.\'One word more--let me be bold, Ione.  Why thinkest thou so highly ofyon dark Egyptian? he hath not about him the air of honest men.  WeGreeks learn mankind from our cradle; we are not the less profound, inthat we affect no sombre mien; our lips smile, but our eyes aregrave--they observe--they note--they study.  Arbaces is not one to becredulously trusted: can it be that he hath wronged me to thee?  I thinkit, for I left him with thee; thou sawest how my presence stung him;since then thou hast not admitted me. Believe nothing that he can say tomy disfavor; if thou dost, tell me so at once; for this Ione owes toGlaucus.  Farewell! this letter touches thy hand; these characters meetthine eyes--shall they be more blessed than he who is their author. Oncemore, farewell!\'It seemed to Ione, as she read this letter, as if a mist had fallen fromher eyes.  What had been the supposed offence of Glaucus?--that he hadnot really loved!  And now, plainly, and in no dubious terms, heconfessed that love.  From that moment his power was fully restored.  Atevery tender word in that letter, so full of romantic and trustfulpassion, her heart smote her.  And had she doubted his faith, and hadshe believed another? and had she not, at least, allowed to him theculprit\'s right to know his crime, to plead in his defence?--the tearsrolled down her cheeks--she kissed the letter--she placed it in herbosom: and, turning to Nydia, who stood in the same place and in thesame posture:\'Wilt thou sit, my child,\' said she, \'while I write an answer to thisletter?\'\'You will answer it, then!\' said Nydia, coldly.  \'Well, the slave thataccompanied me will take back your answer.\'\'For you,\' said Ione, \'stay with me--trust me, your service shall belight.\'Nydia bowed her head.\'What is your name, fair girl?\'\'They call me Nydia.\'\'Your country?\'\'The land of Olympus--Thessaly.\'\'Thou shalt be to me a friend,\' said Ione, caressingly, \'as thou artalready half a countrywoman.  Meanwhile, I beseech thee, stand not onthese cold and glassy marbles.  There! now that thou art seated, I canleave thee for an instant.\'\'Ione to Glaucus greeting.  Come to me, Glaucus,\' wrote Ione, \'come tome to-morrow.  I may have been unjust to thee; but I will tell thee, atleast, the fault that has been imputed to thy charge.  Fear not,henceforth, the Egyptian--fear none.  Thou sayest thou hast expressedtoo much--alas! in these hasty words I have already done so. Farewell.\'As Ione reappeared with the letter, which she did not dare to read aftershe had written (Ah! common rashness, common timidity of love!)--Nydiastarted from her seat.\'You have written to Glaucus?\'\'I have.\'\'And will he thank the messenger who gives to him thy letter?\'Ione forgot that her companion was blind; she blushed from the brow tothe neck, and remained silent.\'I mean this,\' added Nydia, in a calmer tone; \'the lightest word ofcoldness from thee will sadden him--the lightest kindness will rejoice.If it be the first, let the slave take back thine answer; if it be thelast, let me--I will return this evening.\'\'And why, Nydia,\' asked Ione, evasively, \'Wouldst thou be the bearer ofmy letter?\'\'It is so, then!\' said Nydia.  \'Ah! how could it be otherwise; who couldbe unkind to Glaucus?\'\'My child,\' said Ione, a little more reservedly than before, \'thouspeakest warmly--Glaucus, then, is amiable in thine eyes?\'\'Noble Ione! Glaucus has been that to me which neither fortune nor thegods have been--a friend!\'The sadness mingled with dignity with which Nydia uttered these simplewords, affected the beautiful Ione: she bent down and kissed her.  \'Thouart grateful, and deservedly so; why should I blush to say that Glaucusis worthy of thy gratitude?  Go, my Nydia--take to him thyself thisletter--but return again.  If I am from home when thou returnest--asthis evening, perhaps, I shall be--thy chamber shall be prepared next myown.  Nydia, I have no sister--wilt thou be one to me?\' The Thessaliankissed the hand of Ione, and then said, with some embarrassment:\'One favor, fair Ione--may I dare to ask it?\'\'Thou canst not ask what I will not grant,\' replied the Neapolitan.\'They tell me,\' said Nydia, \'that thou art beautiful beyond theloveliness of earth.  Alas! I cannot see that which gladdens the world!Wilt thou suffer me, then, to pass my hand over thy face?--that is mysole criterion of beauty, and I usually guess aright.\'She did not wait for the answer of Ione, but, as she spoke, gently andslowly passed her hand over the bending and half-averted features of theGreek--features which but one image in the world can yet depicture andrecall--that image is the mutilated, but all-wondrous, statue in hernative city--her own Neapolis--that Parian face, before which all thebeauty of the Florentine Venus is poor and earthly--that aspect so fullof harmony--of youth--of genius--of the soul--which modern critics havesupposed the representation of Psyche.Her touch lingered over the braided hair and polished brow--over thedowny and damask cheek--over the dimpled lip--the swan-like and whitishneck.  \'I know now, that thou art beautiful,\' she said: \'and I canpicture thee to my darkness henceforth, and for ever!\'When Nydia left her, Ione sank into a deep but delicious reverie.Glaucus then loved her; he owned it--yes, he loved her.  She drew forthagain that dear confession; she paused over every word, she kissed everyline; she did not ask why he had been maligned, she only felt assuredthat he had been so. She wondered how she had ever believed a syllableagainst him; she wondered how the Egyptian had been enabled to exercisea power against Glaucus; she felt a chill creep over her as she againturned to his warning against Arbaces, and her secret fear of thatgloomy being darkened into awe.  She was awakened from these thoughts byher maidens, who came to announce to her that the hour appointed tovisit Arbaces was arrived; she started, she had forgotten the promise.Her first impression was to renounce it; her second, was to laugh at herown fears of her eldest surviving friend.  She hastened to add the usualornaments to her dress, and doubtful whether she should yet question theEgyptian more closely with respect to his accusation of Glaucus, orwhether she should wait till, without citing the authority, she shouldinsinuate to Glaucus the accusation itself, she took her way to thegloomy mansion of Arbaces.Chapter VIIIONE ENTRAPPED.  THE MOUSE TRIES TO GNAW THE NET.\'DEAREST Nydia!\' exclaimed Glaucus as he read the letter of Ione,\'whitest robed messenger that ever passed between earth and heaven--how,how shall I thank thee?\'\'I am rewarded,\' said the poor Thessalian.\'To-morrow--to-morrow! how shall I while the hours till then?\'The enamoured Greek would not let Nydia escape him, though she soughtseveral times to leave the chamber; he made her recite to him over andover again every syllable of the brief conversation that had taken placebetween her and Ione; a thousand times, forgetting her misfortune, hequestioned her of the looks, of the countenance of his beloved; and thenquickly again excusing his fault, he bade her recommence the wholerecital which he had thus interrupted.  The hours thus painful to Nydiapassed rapidly and delightfully to him, and the twilight had alreadydarkened ere he once more dismissed her to Ione with a fresh letter andwith new flowers.  Scarcely had she gone, than Clodius and several ofhis gay companions broke in upon him; they rallied him on his seclusionduring the whole day, and absence from his customary haunts; theyinvited him to accompany them to the various resorts in that livelycity, which night and day proffered diversity to pleasure.  Then, asnow, in the south (for no land, perhaps, losing more of greatness hasretained more of custom), it was the delight of the Italians to assembleat the evening; and, under the porticoes of temples or the shade of thegroves that interspersed the streets, listening to music or the recitalsof some inventive tale-teller, they hailed the rising moon withlibations of wine and the melodies of song.  Glaucus was too happy to beunsocial; he longed to cast off the exuberance of joy that oppressedhim. He willingly accepted the proposal of his comrades, and laughinglythey sallied out together down the populous and glittering streets.In the meantime Nydia once more gained the house of Ione, who had longleft it; she inquired indifferently whither Ione had gone.The answer arrested and appalled her.\'To the house of Arbaces--of the Egyptian?  Impossible!\'\'It is true, my little one,\' said the slave, who had replied to herquestion.  \'She has known the Egyptian long.\'\'Long! ye gods, yet Glaucus loves her?\' murmured Nydia to herself.\'And has,\' asked she aloud, \'has she often visited him before?\'\'Never till now,\' answered the slave.  \'If all the rumored scandal ofPompeii be true, it would be better, perhaps, if she had not venturedthere at present.  But she, poor mistress mine, hears nothing of thatwhich reaches us; the talk of the vestibulum reaches not to theperistyle.\'\'Never till now!\' repeated Nydia.  \'Art thou sure?\'\'Sure, pretty one: but what is that to thee or to us?\'Nydia hesitated a moment, and then, putting down the flowers with whichshe had been charged, she called to the slave who had accompanied her,and left the house without saying another word.Not till she had got half-way back to the house of Glaucus did she breaksilence, and even then she only murmured inly:\'She does not dream--she cannot--of the dangers into which she hasplunged. Fool that I am--shall I save her?--yes, for I love Glaucusbetter than myself.\'When she arrived at the house of the Athenian, she learnt that he hadgone out with a party of his friends, and none knew whither.  Heprobably would not be home before midnight.The Thessalian groaned; she sank upon a seat in the hall and covered herface with her hands as if to collect her thoughts. \'There is no time tobe lost,\' thought she, starting up.  She turned to the slave who hadaccompanied her.\'Knowest thou,\' said she, \'if Ione has any relative, any intimate friendat Pompeii?\'\'Why, by Jupiter!\' answered the slave, \'art thou silly enough to ask thequestion?  Every one in Pompeii knows that Ione has a brother who, youngand rich, has been--under the rose I speak--so foolish as to become apriest of Isis.\'\'A priest of Isis!  O Gods!  his name?\'\'Apaecides.\'\'I know it all,\' muttered Nydia: \'brother and sister, then, are to beboth victims! Apaecides! yes, that was the name I heard in...  Ha! hewell, then, knows the peril that surrounds his sister; I will go tohim.\'She sprang up at that thought, and taking the staff which always guidedher steps, she hastened to the neighboring shrine of Isis. Till she hadbeen under the guardianship of the kindly Greek, that staff had sufficedto conduct the poor blind girl from corner to corner of Pompeii.  Everystreet, every turning in the more frequented parts, was familiar to her;and as the inhabitants entertained a tender and half-superstitiousveneration for those subject to her infirmity, the passengers had alwaysgiven way to her timid steps.  Poor girl, she little dreamed that sheshould, ere many days were passed, find her blindness her protection,and a guide far safer than the keenest eyes!But since she had been under the roof of Glaucus, he had ordered a slaveto accompany her always; and the poor devil thus appointed, who wassomewhat of the fattest, and who, after having twice performed thejourney to Ione\'s house, now saw himself condemned to a third excursion(whither the gods only knew), hastened after her, deploring his fate,and solemnly assuring Castor and Pollux that he believed the blind girlhad the talaria of Mercury as well as the infirmity of Cupid.Nydia, however, required but little of his assistance to find her way tothe popular temple of Isis: the space before it was now deserted, andshe won without obstacle to the sacred rail.\'There is no one here,\' said the fat slave.  \'What dost thou want, orwhom Knowest thou not that the priests do not live in the temple?\'\'Call out,\' said she, impatiently; \'night and day there is always oneflamen, at least, watching in the shrine of Isis.\'The slave called--no one appeared.\'Seest thou no one?\'\'No one.\'\'Thou mistakest; I hear a sigh: look again.\'The slave, wondering and grumbling, cast round his heavy eyes, andbefore one of the altars, whose remains still crowd the narrow space, hebeheld a form bending as in meditation.\'I see a figure, said he; \'and by the white garments, it is a priest.\'\'O flamen of Isis!\' cried Nydia; \'servant of the Most Ancient, hear me!\'\'Who calls?\' said a low and melancholy voice.\'One who has no common tidings to impart to a member of your body: Icome to declare and not to ask oracles.\'\'With whom wouldst thou confer?  This is no hour for thy conference;depart, disturb me not; the night is sacred to the gods, the day tomen.\'\'Methinks I know thy voice? thou art he whom I seek; yet I have heardthee speak but once before.  Art thou not the priest Apaecides?\'\'I am that man,\' replied the priest, emerging from the altar, andapproaching the rail.\'Thou art! the gods be praised!\' Waving her hand to the slave, she badehim withdraw to a distance; and he, who naturally imagined somesuperstition connected, perhaps, with the safety of Ione, could alonelead her to the temple, obeyed, and seated himself on the ground, at alittle distance. \'Hush!\' said she, speaking quick and low; \'art thouindeed Apaecides?\'\'If thou knowest me, canst thou not recall my features?\'\'I am blind,\' answered Nydia; \'my eyes are in my ear, and thatrecognizes thee: yet swear that thou art he.\'\'By the gods I swear it, by my right hand, and by the moon!\'\'Hush! speak low--bend near--give me thy hand; knowest thou Arbaces?Hast thou laid flowers at the feet of the dead?  Ah! thy hand iscold--hark yet!--hast thou taken the awful vow?\'\'Who art thou, whence comest thou, pale maiden?\' said Apaecides,fearfully: \'I know thee not; thine is not the breast on which this headhath lain; I have never seen thee before.\'\'But thou hast heard my voice: no matter, those recollections it shouldshame us both to recall.  Listen, thou hast a sister.\'\'Speak! speak! what of her?\'\'Thou knowest the banquets of the dead, stranger--it pleases thee,perhaps, to share them--would it please thee to have thy sister apartaker?  Would it please thee that Arbaces was her host?\'\'O gods, he dare not!  Girl, if thou mockest me, tremble!  I will tearthee limb from limb!\'\'I speak the truth; and while I speak, Ione is in the halls ofArbaces--for the first time his guest.  Thou knowest if there be perilin that first time!  Farewell!  I have fulfilled my charge.\'\'Stay! stay!\' cried the priest, passing his wan hand over his brow.  \'Ifthis be true, what--what can be done to save her?  They may not admitme.  I know not all the mazes of that intricate mansion.  O Nemesis!justly am I punished!\'\'I will dismiss yon slave, be thou my guide and comrade; I will leadthee to the private door of the house: I will whisper to thee the wordwhich admits. Take some weapon: it may be needful!\'\'Wait an instant,\' said Apaecides, retiring into one of the cells thatflank the temple, and reappearing in a few moments wrapped in a largecloak, which was then much worn by all classes, and which concealed hissacred dress. \'Now,\' he said, grinding his teeth, \'if Arbaces hath daredto--but he dare not! he dare not!  Why should I suspect him?  Is he sobase a villain?  I will not think it--yet, sophist! dark bewilderer thathe is!  O gods protect--hush! are there gods?  Yes, there is onegoddess, at least, whose voice I can command; and that is--Vengeance!\'Muttering these disconnected thoughts, Apaecides, followed by his silentand sightless companion, hastened through the most solitary paths to thehouse of the Egyptian.The slave, abruptly dismissed by Nydia, shrugged his shoulders, mutteredan adjuration, and, nothing loath, rolled off to his cubiculum.Chapter VIIITHE SOLITUDE AND SOLILOQUY OF THE EGYPTIAN.  HIS CHARACTER ANALYSED.WE must go back a few hours in the progress of our story.  At the firstgrey dawn of the day, which Glaucus had already marked with white, theEgyptian was seated, sleepless and alone, on the summit of the lofty andpyramidal tower which flanked his house.  A tall parapet around itserved as a wall, and conspired, with the height of the edifice and thegloomy trees that girded the mansion, to defy the prying eyes ofcuriosity or observation.  A table, on which lay a scroll, filled withmystic figures, was before him. On high, the stars waxed dim and faint,and the shades of night melted from the sterile mountain-tops; onlyabove Vesuvius there rested a deep and massy cloud, which for severaldays past had gathered darker and more solid over its summit.  Thestruggle of night and day was more visible over the broad ocean, whichstretched calm, like a gigantic lake, bounded by the circling shoresthat, covered with vines and foliage, and gleaming here and there withthe white walls of sleeping cities, sloped to the scarce rippling waves.It was the hour above all others most sacred to the daring science ofthe Egyptian--the science which would read our changeful destinies inthe stars.He had filled his scroll, he had noted the moment and the sign; and,leaning upon his hand, he had surrendered himself to the thoughts whichhis calculation excited.\'Again do the stars forewarn me!  Some danger, then, assuredly awaitsme!\' said he, slowly; \'some danger, violent and sudden in its nature.The stars wear for me the same mocking menace which, if our chroniclesdo not err, they once wore for Pyrrhus--for him, doomed to strive forall things, to enjoy none--all attacking, nothing gaining--battleswithout fruit, laurels without triumph, fame without success; at lastmade craven by his own superstitions, and slain like a dog by a tilefrom the hand of an old woman! Verily, the stars flatter when they giveme a type in this fool of war--when they promise to the ardour of mywisdom the same results as to the madness of his ambition--perpetualexercise--no certain goal!--the Sisyphus task, the mountain and thestone!--the stone, a gloomy image!--it reminds me that I am threatenedwith somewhat of the same death as the Epirote.  Let me look again.""Beware,"" say the shining prophets, ""how thou passest under ancientroofs, or besieged walls, or overhanging cliffs--a stone hurled fromabove, is charged by the curses of destiny against thee!"" And, at nodistant date from this, comes the peril: but I cannot, of a certainty,read the day and hour.  Well! if my glass runs low, the sands shallsparkle to the last. Yet, if I escape this peril--ay, if Iescape--bright and clear as the moonlight track along the waters glowsthe rest of my existence.  I see honors, happiness, success, shiningupon every billow of the dark gulf beneath which I must sink at last.What, then, with such destinies beyond the peril, shall I succumb to theperil?  My soul whispers hope, it sweeps exultingly beyond the bodinghour, it revels in the future--its own courage is its fittest omen.  IfI were to perish so suddenly and so soon, the shadow of death woulddarken over me, and I should feel the icy presentiment of my doom.  Mysoul would express, in sadness and in gloom, its forecast of the drearyOrcus.  But it smiles--it assures me of deliverance.\'As he thus concluded his soliloquy, the Egyptian involuntarily rose.  Hepaced rapidly the narrow space of that star-roofed floor, and, pausingat the parapet, looked again upon the grey and melancholy heavens.  Thechills of the faint dawn came refreshingly upon his brow, and graduallyhis mind resumed its natural and collected calm.  He withdrew his gazefrom the stars, as, one after one, they receded into the depths ofheaven; and his eyes fell over the broad expanse below.  Dim in thesilenced port of the city rose the masts of the galleys; along that martof luxury and of labor was stilled the mighty hum.  No lights, save hereand there from before the columns of a temple, or in the porticoes ofthe voiceless forum, broke the wan and fluctuating light of thestruggling morn.  From the heart of the torpid city, so soon to vibratewith a thousand passions, there came no sound: the streams of lifecirculated not; they lay locked under the ice of sleep.  From the hugespace of the amphitheatre, with its stony seats rising one above theother--coiled and round as some slumbering monster--rose a thin andghastly mist, which gathered darker, and more dark, over the scatteredfoliage that gloomed in its vicinity.  The city seemed as, after theawful change of seventeen ages, it seems now to the traveler,--a City ofthe Dead.The ocean itself--that serene and tideless sea--lay scarce less hushed,save that from its deep bosom came, softened by the distance, a faintand regular murmur, like the breathing of its sleep; and curving far, aswith outstretched arms, into the green and beautiful land, it seemedunconsciously to clasp to its breast the cities sloping to itsmargin--Stabiae, and Herculaneum, and Pompeii--those children anddarlings of the deep.  \'Ye slumber,\' said the Egyptian, as he scowledover the cities, the boast and flower of Campania; \'ye slumber!--wouldit were the eternal repose of death! As ye now--jewels in the crown ofempire--so once were the cities of the Nile!  Their greatness hathperished from them, they sleep amidst ruins, their palaces and theirshrines are tombs, the serpent coils in the grass of their streets, thelizard basks in their solitary halls.  By that mysterious law of Nature,which humbles one to exalt the other, ye have thriven upon their ruins;thou, haughty Rome, hast usurped the glories of Sesostris andSemiramis--thou art a robber, clothing thyself with their spoils!  Andthese--slaves in thy triumph--that I (the last son of forgottenmonarchs) survey below, reservoirs of thine all-pervading power andluxury, I curse as I behold! The time shall come when Egypt shall beavenged! when the barbarian\'s steed shall make his manger in the GoldenHouse of Nero! and thou that hast sown the wind with conquest shalt reapthe harvest in the whirlwind of desolation!\'As the Egyptian uttered a prediction which fate so fearfully fulfilled,a more solemn and boding image of ill omen never occurred to the dreamsof painter or of poet.  The morning light, which can pale so wanly eventhe young cheek of beauty, gave his majestic and stately features almostthe colors of the grave, with the dark hair falling massively aroundthem, and the dark robes flowing long and loose, and the armoutstretched from that lofty eminence, and the glittering eyes, fiercewith a savage gladness--half prophet and half fiend!He turned his gaze from the city and the ocean; before him lay thevineyards and meadows of the rich Campania.  The gate and walls--ancient,half Pelasgic--of the city, seemed not to bound its extent. Villas andvillages stretched on every side up the ascent of Vesuvius, not nearlythen so steep or so lofty as at present.  For, as Rome itself is builton an exhausted volcano, so in similar security the inhabitants of theSouth tenanted the green and vine-clad places around a volcano whosefires they believed at rest for ever.  From the gate stretched the longstreet of tombs, various in size and architecture, by which, on thatside, the city is as yet approached. Above all, rode the cloud-cappedsummit of the Dread Mountain, with the shadows, now dark, now light,betraying the mossy caverns and ashy rocks, which testified the pastconflagrations, and might have prophesied--but man is blind--that whichwas to come!Difficult was it then and there to guess the causes why the tradition ofthe place wore so gloomy and stern a hue; why, in those smiling plains,for miles around--to Baiae and Misenum--the poets had imagined theentrance and thresholds of their hell--their Acheron, and their fabledStyx: why, in those Phlegrae, now laughing with the vine, they placedthe battles of the gods, and supposed the daring Titans to have soughtthe victory of heaven--save, indeed, that yet, in yon seared and blastedsummit, fancy might think to read the characters of the Olympianthunderbolt.But it was neither the rugged height of the still volcano, nor thefertility of the sloping fields, nor the melancholy avenue of tombs, northe glittering villas of a polished and luxurious people, that nowarrested the eye of the Egyptian.  On one part of the landscape, themountain of Vesuvius descended to the plain in a narrow and uncultivatedridge, broken here and there by jagged crags and copses of wild foliage.At the base of this lay a marshy and unwholesome pool; and the intentgaze of Arbaces caught the outline of some living form moving by themarshes, and stooping ever and anon as if to pluck its rank produce.\'Ho!\' said he, aloud, \'I have then, another companion in these unworldlynight-watches.  The witch of Vesuvius is abroad.  What! doth she, too,as the credulous imagine--doth she, too, learn the lore of the greatstars? Hath she been uttering foul magic to the moon, or culling (as herpauses betoken) foul herbs from the venomous marsh? Well, I must seethis fellow-laborer.  Whoever strives to know learns that no human loreis despicable.  Despicable only you--ye fat and bloated things--slavesof luxury--sluggards in thought--who, cultivating nothing but the barrensense, dream that its poor soil can produce alike the myrtle and thelaurel.  No, the wise only can enjoy--to us only true luxury is given,when mind, brain, invention, experience, thought, learning, imagination,all contribute like rivers to swell the seas of SENSE!--Ione!\'As Arbaces uttered that last and charmed word, his thoughts sunk at onceinto a more deep and profound channel.  His steps paused; he took nothis eyes from the ground; once or twice he smiled joyously, and then, ashe turned from his place of vigil, and sought his couch, he muttered,\'If death frowns so near, I will say at least that I have lived--Ioneshall be mine!\'The character of Arbaces was one of those intricate and varied webs, inwhich even the mind that sat within it was sometimes confused andperplexed. In him, the son of a fallen dynasty, the outcast of a sunkenpeople, was that spirit of discontented pride, which ever rankles in oneof a sterner mould, who feels himself inexorably shut from the sphere inwhich his fathers shone, and to which Nature as well as birth no lessentitles himself.  This sentiment hath no benevolence; it wars withsociety, it sees enemies in mankind.  But with this sentiment did not goits common companion, poverty. Arbaces possessed wealth which equalledthat of most of the Roman nobles; and this enabled him to gratify to theutmost the passions which had no outlet in business or ambition.Travelling from clime to clime, and beholding still Rome everywhere, heincreased both his hatred of society and his passion for pleasure.  Hewas in a vast prison, which, however, he could fill with the ministersof luxury.  He could not escape from the prison, and his only object,therefore, was to give it the character of the palace.  The Egyptians,from the earliest time, were devoted to the joys of sense; Arbacesinherited both their appetite for sensuality and the glow of imaginationwhich struck light from its rottenness.  But still, unsocial in hispleasures as in his graver pursuits, and brooking neither superior norequal, he admitted few to his companionship, save the willing slaves ofhis profligacy.  He was the solitary lord of a crowded harem; but, withall, he felt condemned to that satiety which is the constant curse ofmen whose intellect is above their pursuits, and that which once hadbeen the impulse of passion froze down to the ordinance of custom.From the disappointments of sense he sought to raise himself by thecultivation of knowledge; but as it was not his object to serve mankind,so he despised that knowledge which is practical and useful.  His darkimagination loved to exercise itself in those more visionary and obscureresearches which are ever the most delightful to a wayward and solitarymind, and to which he himself was invited by the daring pride of hisdisposition and the mysterious traditions of his clime. Dismissing faithin the confused creeds of the heathen world, he reposed the greatestfaith in the power of human wisdom. He did not know (perhaps no one inthat age distinctly did) the limits which Nature imposes upon ourdiscoveries.  Seeing that the higher we mount in knowledge the morewonders we behold, he imagined that Nature not only worked miracles inher ordinary course, but that she might, by the cabala of some mastersoul, be diverted from that course itself.  Thus he pursued science,across her appointed boundaries, into the land of perplexity and shadow.From the truths of astronomy he wandered into astrological fallacy; fromthe secrets of chemistry he passed into the spectral labyrinth of magic;and he who could be sceptical as to the power of the gods, wascredulously superstitious as to the power of man.The cultivation of magic, carried at that day to a singular height amongthe would-be wise, was especially Eastern in its origin; it was alien tothe early philosophy of the Greeks; nor had it been received by themwith favor until Ostanes, who accompanied the army of Xerxes,introduced, amongst the simple credulities of Hellas, the solemnsuperstitions of Zoroaster.  Under the Roman emperors it had become,however, naturalized at Rome (a meet subject for Juvenal\'s fiery wit).Intimately connected with magic was the worship of Isis, and theEgyptian religion was the means by which was extended the devotion toEgyptian sorcery.  The theurgic, or benevolent magic--the goetic, ordark and evil necromancy--were alike in pre-eminent repute during thefirst century of the Christian era; and the marvels of Faustus are notcomparable to those of Apollonius.  Kings, courtiers, and sages, alltrembled before the professors of the dread science.  And not the leastremarkable of his tribe was the most formidable and profound Arbaces.His fame and his discoveries were known to all the cultivators of magic;they even survived himself.  But it was not by his real name that he washonored by the sorcerer and the sage: his real name, indeed, was unknownin Italy, for \'Arbaces\' was not a genuinely Egyptian but a Medianappellation, which, in the admixture and unsettlement of the ancientraces, had become common in the country of the Nile; and there werevarious reasons, not only of pride, but of policy (for in youth he hadconspired against the majesty of Rome), which induced him to conceal histrue name and rank.  But neither by the name he had borrowed from theMede, nor by that which in the colleges of Egypt would have attested hisorigin from kings, did the cultivators of magic acknowledge the potentmaster.  He received from their homage a more mystic appellation, andwas long remembered in Magna Graecia and the Eastern plain by the nameof \'Hermes, the Lord of the Flaming Belt\'. His subtle speculations andboasted attributes of wisdom, recorded in various volumes, were amongthose tokens \'of the curious arts\' which the Christian converts mostjoyfully, yet most fearfully, burnt at Ephesus, depriving posterity ofthe proofs of the cunning of the fiend.The conscience of Arbaces was solely of the intellect--it was awed by nomoral laws.  If man imposed these checks upon the herd, so he believedthat man, by superior wisdom, could raise himself above them. \'If (hereasoned) I have the genius to impose laws, have I not the right tocommand my own creations?  Still more, have I not the right tocontrol--to evade--to scorn--the fabrications of yet meaner intellectsthan my own?\' Thus, if he were a villain, he justified his villainy bywhat ought to have made him virtuous--namely, the elevation of hiscapacities.Most men have more or less the passion for power; in Arbaces thatpassion corresponded exactly to his character.  It was not the passionfor an external and brute authority.  He desired not the purple and thefasces, the insignia of vulgar command.  His youthful ambition oncefoiled and defeated, scorn had supplied its place--his pride, hiscontempt for Rome--Rome, which had become the synonym of the world(Rome, whose haughty name he regarded with the same disdain as thatwhich Rome herself lavished upon the barbarian), did not permit him toaspire to sway over others, for that would render him at once the toolor creature of the emperor.  He, the Son of the Great Race ofRameses--he execute the orders of, and receive his power from,another!--the mere notion filled him with rage.  But in rejecting anambition that coveted nominal distinctions, he but indulged the more inthe ambition to rule the heart.  Honoring mental power as the greatestof earthly gifts, he loved to feel that power palpably in himself, byextending it over all whom he encountered.  Thus had he ever sought theyoung--thus had he ever fascinated and controlled them.  He loved tofind subjects in men\'s souls--to rule over an invisible and immaterialempire!--had he been less sensual and less wealthy, he might have soughtto become the founder of a new religion. As it was, his energies werechecked by his pleasures. Besides, however, the vague love of this moralsway (vanity so dear to sages!) he was influenced by a singular anddreamlike devotion to all that belonged to the mystic Land his ancestorshad swayed. Although he disbelieved in her deities, he believed in theallegories they represented (or rather he interpreted those allegoriesanew).  He loved to keep alive the worship of Egypt, because he thusmaintained the shadow and the recollection of her power.  He loaded,therefore, the altars of Osiris and of Isis with regal donations, andwas ever anxious to dignify their priesthood by new and wealthyconverts.  The vow taken--the priesthood embraced--he usually chose thecomrades of his pleasures from those whom he made his victims, partlybecause he thus secured to himself their secrecy--partly because he thusyet more confirmed to himself his peculiar power. Hence the motives ofhis conduct to Apaecides, strengthened as these were, in that instance,by his passion for Ione.He had seldom lived long in one place; but as he grew older, he grewmore wearied of the excitement of new scenes, and he had sojourned amongthe delightful cities of Campania for a period which surprised evenhimself.  In fact, his pride somewhat crippled his choice of residence.His unsuccessful conspiracy excluded him from those burning climes whichhe deemed of right his own hereditary possession, and which now cowered,supine and sunken, under the wings of the Roman eagle.  Rome herself washateful to his indignant soul; nor did he love to find his richesrivalled by the minions of the court, and cast into comparative povertyby the mighty magnificence of the court itself.  The Campanian citiesproffered to him all that his nature craved--the luxuries of anunequalled climate--the imaginative refinements of a voluptuouscivilization.  He was removed from the sight of a superior wealth; hewas without rivals to his riches; he was free from the spies of ajealous court.  As long as he was rich, none pried into his conduct.  Hepursued the dark tenour of his way undisturbed and secure.It is the curse of sensualists never to love till the pleasures of sensebegin to pall; their ardent youth is frittered away in countlessdesires--their hearts are exhausted.  So, ever chasing love, and taughtby a restless imagination to exaggerate, perhaps, its charms, theEgyptian had spent all the glory of his years without attaining theobject of his desires.  The beauty of to-morrow succeeded the beauty ofto-day, and the shadows bewildered him in his pursuit of the substance.When, two years before the present date, he beheld Ione, he saw, for thefirst time, one whom he imagined he could love.  He stood, then, uponthat bridge of life, from which man sees before him distinctly a wastedyouth on the one side, and the darkness of approaching age upon theother: a time in which we are more than ever anxious, perhaps, to secureto ourselves, ere it be yet too late, whatever we have been taught toconsider necessary to the enjoyment of a life of which the brighter halfis gone.With an earnestness and a patience which he had never before commandedfor his pleasures, Arbaces had devoted himself to win the heart of Ione.It did not content him to love, he desired to be loved. In this hope hehad watched the expanding youth of the beautiful Neapolitan; and,knowing the influence that the mind possesses over those who are taughtto cultivate the mind, he had contributed willingly to form the geniusand enlighten the intellect of Ione, in the hope that she would be thusable to appreciate what he felt would be his best claim to heraffection: viz, a character which, however criminal and perverted, wasrich in its original elements of strength and grandeur.  When he feltthat character to be acknowledged, he willingly allowed, nay, encouragedher, to mix among the idle votaries of pleasure, in the belief that hersoul, fitted for higher commune, would miss the companionship of hisown, and that, in comparison with others, she would learn to loveherself.  He had forgot, that as the sunflower to the sun, so youthturns to youth, until his jealousy of Glaucus suddenly apprised him ofhis error.  From that moment, though, as we have seen, he knew not theextent of his danger, a fiercer and more tumultuous direction was givento a passion long controlled.  Nothing kindles the fire of love like thesprinkling of the anxieties of jealousy; it takes then a wilder, a moreresistless flame; it forgets its softness; it ceases to be tender; itassumes something of the intensity--of the ferocity--of hate.Arbaces resolved to lose no further time upon cautious and perilouspreparations: he resolved to place an irrevocable barrier betweenhimself and his rivals: he resolved to possess himself of the person ofIone: not that in his present love, so long nursed and fed by hopespurer than those of passion alone, he would have been contented withthat mere possession. He desired the heart, the soul, no less than thebeauty, of Ione; but he imagined that once separated by a daring crimefrom the rest of mankind--once bound to Ione by a tie that memory couldnot break, she would be driven to concentrate her thoughts in him--thathis arts would complete his conquest, and that, according to the truemoral of the Roman and the Sabine, the empire obtained by force would becemented by gentler means. This resolution was yet more confirmed in himby his belief in the prophecies of the stars: they had long foretold tohim this year, and even the present month, as the epoch of some dreaddisaster, menacing life itself.  He was driven to a certain and limiteddate. He resolved to crowd, monarch-like, on his funeral pyre all thathis soul held most dear.  In his own words, if he were to die, heresolved to feel that he had lived, and that Ione should be his own.Chapter IXWHAT BECOMES OF IONE IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES. THE FIRST SIGNAL OF THEWRATH OF THE DREAD FOE.WHEN Ione entered the spacious hall of the Egyptian, the same awe whichhad crept over her brother impressed itself also upon her: there seemedto her as to him something ominous and warning in the still and mournfulfaces of those dread Theban monsters, whose majestic and passionlessfeatures the marble so well portrayed:  Their look, with the reach of past ages, was wise,  And the soul of eternity thought in their eyes.The tall AEthiopian slave grinned as he admitted her, and motioned toher to proceed.  Half-way up the hall she was met by Arbaces himself, infestive robes, which glittered with jewels.  Although it was broad daywithout, the mansion, according to the practice of the luxurious, wasartificially darkened, and the lamps cast their still and odor-givinglight over the rich floors and ivory roofs.\'Beautiful Ione,\' said Arbaces, as he bent to touch her hand, \'it is youthat have eclipsed the day--it is your eyes that light up the halls--itis your breath which fills them with perfumes.\'\'You must not talk to me thus,\' said Ione, smiling, \'you forget thatyour lore has sufficiently instructed my mind to render these gracefulflatteries to my person unwelcome.  It was you who taught me to disdainadulation: will you unteach your pupil?\'There was something so frank and charming in the manner of Ione, as shethus spoke, that the Egyptian was more than ever enamoured, and morethan ever disposed to renew the offence he had committed; he, however,answered quickly and gaily, and hastened to renew the conversation.He led her through the various chambers of a house, which seemed tocontain to her eyes, inexperienced to other splendor than the minuteelegance of Campanian cities, the treasures of the world.In the walls were set pictures of inestimable art, the lights shone overstatues of the noblest age of Greece.  Cabinets of gems, each cabinetitself a gem, filled up the interstices of the columns; the mostprecious woods lined the thresholds and composed the doors; gold andjewels seemed lavished all around.  Sometimes they were alone in theserooms--sometimes they passed through silent rows of slaves, who,kneeling as she passed, proffered to her offerings of bracelets, ofchains, of gems, which the Egyptian vainly entreated her to receive.\'I have often heard,\' said she, wonderingly, \'that you were rich; but Inever dreamed of the amount of your wealth.\'\'Would I could coin it all,\' replied the Egyptian, \'into one crown,which I might place upon that snowy brow!\'\'Alas! the weight would crush me; I should be a second Tarpeia,\'answered Ione, laughingly.\'But thou dost not disdain riches, O Ione! they know not what life iscapable of who are not wealthy.  Gold is the great magician of earth--itrealizes our dreams--it gives them the power of a god--there is agrandeur, a sublimity, in its possession; it is the mightiest, yet themost obedient of our slaves.\'The artful Arbaces sought to dazzle the young Neapolitan by histreasures and his eloquence; he sought to awaken in her the desire to bemistress of what she surveyed: he hoped that she would confound theowner with the possessions, and that the charms of his wealth would bereflected on himself.  Meanwhile, Ione was secretly somewhat uneasy atthe gallantries which escaped from those lips, which, till lately, hadseemed to disdain the common homage we pay to beauty; and with thatdelicate subtlety, which woman alone possesses, she sought to ward offshafts deliberately aimed, and to laugh or to talk away the meaning fromhis warming language.  Nothing in the world is more pretty than thatsame species of defence; it is the charm of the African necromancer whoprofessed with a feather to turn aside the winds.The Egyptian was intoxicated and subdued by her grace even more than byher beauty: it was with difficulty that he suppressed his emotions;alas! the feather was only powerful against the summer breezes--it wouldbe the sport of the storm.Suddenly, as they stood in one hall, which was surrounded by draperiesof silver and white, the Egyptian clapped his hands, and, as if byenchantment, a banquet rose from the floor--a couch or throne, with acrimson canopy, ascended simultaneously at the feet of Ione--and at thesame instant from behind the curtains swelled the invisible and softestmusic.Arbaces placed himself at the feet of Ione--and children, young andbeautiful as Loves, ministered to the feast.The feast was over, the music sank into a low and subdued strain, andArbaces thus addressed his beautiful guest:\'Hast thou never in this dark and uncertain world--hast thou neveraspired, my pupil, to look beyond--hast thou never wished to put asidethe veil of futurity, and to behold on the shores of Fate the shadowyimages of things to be?  For it is not the past alone that has itsghosts: each event to come has also its spectrum--its shade; when thehour arrives, life enters it, the shadow becomes corporeal, and walksthe world.  Thus, in the land beyond the grave, are ever two impalpableand spiritual hosts--the things to be, the things that have been! If byour wisdom we can penetrate that land, we see the one as the other, andlearn, as I have learned, not alone the mysteries of the dead, but alsothe destiny of the living.\'\'As thou hast learned!--Can wisdom attain so far?\'\'Wilt thou prove my knowledge, Ione, and behold the representation ofthine own fate?  It is a drama more striking than those of AEschylus: itis one I have prepared for thee, if thou wilt see the shadows performtheir part.\'The Neapolitan trembled; she thought of Glaucus, and sighed as well astrembled: were their destinies to be united?  Half incredulous, halfbelieving, half awed, half alarmed by the words of her strange host, sheremained for some moments silent, and then answered:\'It may revolt--it may terrify; the knowledge of the future will perhapsonly embitter the present!\'\'Not so, Ione.  I have myself looked upon thy future lot, and the ghostsof thy Future bask in the gardens of Elysium: amidst the asphodel andthe rose they prepare the garlands of thy sweet destiny, and the Fates,so harsh to others, weave only for thee the web of happiness and love.Wilt thou then come and behold thy doom, so that thou mayest enjoy itbeforehand?\'Again the heart of Ione murmured \'Glaucus\'; she uttered a half-audibleassent; the Egyptian rose, and taking her by the hand, he led her acrossthe banquet-room--the curtains withdrew as by magic hands, and the musicbroke forth in a louder and gladder strain; they passed a row ofcolumns, on either side of which fountains cast aloft their fragrantwaters; they descended by broad and easy steps into a garden.  The evehad commenced; the moon was already high in heaven, and those sweetflowers that sleep by day, and fill, with ineffable odorous, the airs ofnight, were thickly scattered amidst alleys cut through the star-litfoliage; or, gathered in baskets, lay like offerings at the feet of thefrequent statues that gleamed along their path.\'Whither wouldst thou lead me, Arbaces?\' said Ione, wonderingly.\'But yonder,\' said he, pointing to a small building which stood at theend of the vista.  \'It is a temple consecrated to the Fates--our ritesrequire such holy ground.\'They passed into a narrow hall, at the end of which hung a sablecurtain. Arbaces lifted it; Ione entered, and found herself in totaldarkness.\'Be not alarmed,\' said the Egyptian, \'the light will rise instantly.\'While he so spoke, a soft, and warm, and gradual light diffused itselfaround; as it spread over each object, Ione perceived that she was in anapartment of moderate size, hung everywhere with black; a couch withdraperies of the same hue was beside her.  In the centre of the room wasa small altar, on which stood a tripod of bronze.  At one side, upon alofty column of granite, was a colossal head of the blackest marble,which she perceived, by the crown of wheat-ears that encircled the brow,represented the great Egyptian goddess.  Arbaces stood before the altar:he had laid his garland on the shrine, and seemed occupied with pouringinto the tripod the contents of a brazen vase; suddenly from that tripodleaped into life a blue, quick, darting, irregular flame; the Egyptiandrew back to the side of Ione, and muttered some words in a languageunfamiliar to her ear; the curtain at the back of the altar wavedtremulously to and fro--it parted slowly, and in the aperture which wasthus made, Ione beheld an indistinct and pale landscape, which graduallygrew brighter and clearer as she gazed; at length she discovered plainlytrees, and rivers, and meadows, and all the beautiful diversity of therichest earth.  At length, before the landscape, a dim shadow glided; itrested opposite to Ione; slowly the same charm seemed to operate upon itas over the rest of the scene; it took form and shape, and lo!--in itsfeature and in its form Ione beheld herself!Then the scene behind the spectre faded away, and was succeeded by therepresentation of a gorgeous palace; a throne was raised in the centreof its hall, the dim forms of slaves and guards were ranged around it,and a pale hand held over the throne the likeness of a diadem.A new actor now appeared; he was clothed from head to foot in a darkrobe--his face was concealed--he knelt at the feet of the shadowyIone--he clasped her hand--he pointed to the throne, as if to invite herto ascend it.The Neapolitan\'s heart beat violently.  \'Shall the shadow discloseitself?\' whispered a voice beside her--the voice of Arbaces.\'Ah, yes!\' answered Ione, softly.Arbaces raised his hand--the spectre seemed to drop the mantle thatconcealed its form--and Ione shrieked--it was Arbaces himself that thusknelt before her.\'This is, indeed, thy fate!\' whispered again the Egyptian\'s voice in herear.  \'And thou art destined to be the bride of Arbaces.\'Ione started--the black curtain closed over the phantasmagoria: andArbaces himself--the real, the living Arbaces--was at her feet.\'Oh, Ione!\' said he, passionately gazing upon her, \'listen to one whohas long struggled vainly with his love.  I adore thee!  The Fates donot lie--thou art destined to be mine--I have sought the world around,and found none like thee.  From my youth upward, I have sighed for suchas thou art. I have dreamed till I saw thee--I wake, and I behold thee.Turn not away from me, Ione; think not of me as thou hast thought; I amnot that being--cold, insensate, and morose, which I have seemed tothee.  Never woman had lover so devoted--so passionate as I will be toIone.  Do not struggle in my clasp: see--I release thy hand.  Take itfrom me if thou wilt--well be it so!  But do not reject me, Ione--do notrashly reject--judge of thy power over him whom thou canst thustransform.  I, who never knelt to mortal being, kneel to thee.  I, whohave commanded fate, receive from thee my own.  Ione, tremble not, thouart my queen--my goddess--be my bride!  All the wishes thou canst formshall be fulfilled. The ends of the earth shall minister to thee--pomp,power, luxury, shall be thy slaves.  Arbaces shall have no ambition,save the pride of obeying thee. Ione, turn upon me those eyes--shed uponme thy smile. Dark is my soul when thy face is hid from it: shine overme, my sun--my heaven--my daylight!--Ione, Ione--do not reject my love!\'Alone, and in the power of this singular and fearful man, Ione was notyet terrified; the respect of his language, the softness of his voice,reassured her; and, in her own purity, she felt protection.  But she wasconfused--astonished: it was some moments before she could recover thepower of reply.\'Rise, Arbaces!\' said she at length; and she resigned to him once moreher hand, which she as quickly withdrew again, when she felt upon it theburning pressure of his lips.  \'Rise! and if thou art serious, if thylanguage be in earnest...\'\'If!\' said he tenderly.\'Well, then, listen to me: you have been my guardian, my friend, mymonitor; for this new character I was not prepared--think not,\' sheadded quickly, as she saw his dark eyes glitter with the fierceness ofhis passion--\'think not that I scorn--that I am untouched--that I am nothonored by this homage; but, say--canst thou hear me calmly?\'\'Ay, though thy words were lightning, and could blast me!\'\'I love another!\' said Ione, blushingly, but in a firm voice.\'By the gods--by hell!\' shouted Arbaces, rising to his fullest height;\'dare not tell me that--dare not mock me--it is impossible!--Whom hastthou seen--whom known?  Oh, Ione, it is thy woman\'s invention, thywoman\'s art that speaks--thou wouldst gain time; I have surprised--Ihave terrified thee.  Do with me as thou wilt--say that thou lovest notme; but say not that thou lovest another!\'\'Alas!\' began Ione; and then, appalled before his sudden andunlooked-for violence, she burst into tears.Arbaces came nearer to her--his breath glowed fiercely on her cheek; hewound his arms round her--she sprang from his embrace.  In the strugglea tablet fell from her bosom on the ground: Arbaces perceived, andseized it--it was the letter that morning received from Glaucus.  Ionesank upon the couch, half dead with terror.Rapidly the eyes of Arbaces ran over the writing; the Neapolitan did notdare to gaze upon him: she did not see the deadly paleness that cameover his countenance--she marked not his withering frown, nor thequivering of his lip, nor the convulsions that heaved his breast.  Heread it to the end, and then, as the letter fell from his hand, he said,in a voice of deceitful calmness:\'Is the writer of this the man thou lovest?\'Ione sobbed, but answered not.\'Speak!\' he rather shrieked than said.\'It is--it is!\'And his name--it is written here--his name is Glaucus!\'Ione, clasping her hands, looked round as for succour or escape.\'Then hear me,\' said Arbaces, sinking his voice into a whisper; \'thoushalt go to thy tomb rather than to his arms!  What! thinkest thouArbaces will brook a rival such as this puny Greek?  What! thinkest thouthat he has watched the fruit ripen, to yield it to another!  Prettyfool--no!  Thou art mine--all--only mine: and thus--thus I seize andclaim thee!\' As he spoke, he caught Ione in his arms; and, in thatferocious grasp, was all the energy--less of love than of revenge.But to Ione despair gave supernatural strength: she again tore herselffrom him--she rushed to that part of the room by which she hadentered--she half withdrew the curtain--he had seized her--again shebroke away from him--and fell, exhausted, and with a loud shriek, at thebase of the column which supported the head of the Egyptian goddess.Arbaces paused for a moment, as if to regain his breath; and thence oncemore darted upon his prey.At that instant the curtain was rudely torn aside, the Egyptian felt afierce and strong grasp upon his shoulder.  He turned--he beheld beforehim the flashing eyes of Glaucus, and the pale, worn, but menacing,countenance of Apaecides.  \'Ah,\' he muttered, as he glared from one tothe other, \'what Fury hath sent ye hither?\'\'Ate,\' answered Glaucus; and he closed at once with the Egyptian.Meanwhile, Apaecides raised his sister, now lifeless, from the ground;his strength, exhausted by a mind long overwrought, did not suffice tobear her away, light and delicate though her shape: he placed her,therefore, on the couch, and stood over her with a brandishing knife,watching the contest between Glaucus and the Egyptian, and ready toplunge his weapon in the bosom of Arbaces should he be victorious in thestruggle.  There is, perhaps, nothing on earth so terrible as the nakedand unarmed contest of animal strength, no weapon but those which Naturesupplies to rage.  Both the antagonists were now locked in each other\'sgrasp--the hand of each seeking the throat of the other--the face drawnback--the fierce eyes flashing--the muscles strained--the veinsswelled--the lips apart--the teeth set--both were strong beyond theordinary power of men, both animated by relentless wrath; they coiled,they wound, around each other; they rocked to and fro--they swayed fromend to end of their confined arena--they uttered cries of ire andrevenge--they were now before the altar--now at the base of the columnwhere the struggle had commenced: they drew back for breath--Arbacesleaning against the column--Glaucus a few paces apart.\'O ancient goddess!\' exclaimed Arbaces, clasping the column, and raisinghis eyes toward the sacred image it supported, \'protect thychosen--proclaim they vengeance against this thing of an upstart creed,who with sacrilegious violence profanes thy resting-place and assailsthy servant.\'As he spoke, the still and vast features of the goddess seemed suddenlyto glow with life; through the black marble, as through a transparentveil, flushed luminously a crimson and burning hue; around the headplayed and darted coruscations of livid lightning; the eyes became likeballs of lurid fire, and seemed fixed in withering and intolerable wrathupon the countenance of the Greek.  Awed and appalled by this sudden andmystic answer to the prayer of his foe, and not free from the hereditarysuperstitions of his race, the cheeks of Glaucus paled before thatstrange and ghastly animation of the marble--his knees knockedtogether--he stood, seized with a divine panic, dismayed, aghast, halfunmanned before his foe! Arbaces gave him not breathing time to recoverhis stupor: \'Die, wretch!\' he shouted, in a voice of thunder, as hesprang upon the Greek; \'the Mighty Mother claims thee as a livingsacrifice!\' Taken thus by surprise in the first consternation of hissuperstitious fears, the Greek lost his footing--the marble floor was assmooth as glass--he slid--he fell. Arbaces planted his foot on thebreast of his fallen foe.  Apaecides, taught by his sacred profession,as well as by his knowledge of Arbaces, to distrust all miraculousinterpositions, had not shared the dismay of his companion; he rushedforward--his knife gleamed in the air--the watchful Egyptian caught hisarm as it descended--one wrench of his powerful hand tore the weaponfrom the weak grasp of the priest--one sweeping blow stretched him tothe earth--with a loud and exulting yell Arbaces brandished the knife onhigh. Glaucus gazed upon his impending fate with unwinking eyes, and inthe stern and scornful resignation of a fallen gladiator, when, at thatawful instant, the floor shook under them with a rapid and convulsivethroe--a mightier spirit than that of the Egyptian was abroad!--a giantand crushing power, before which sunk into sudden impotence his passionand his arts. IT woke--it stirred--that Dread Demon of theEarthquake--laughing to scorn alike the magic of human guile and themalice of human wrath.  As a Titan, on whom the mountains are piled, itroused itself from the sleep of years, it moved on its torturedcouch--the caverns below groaned and trembled beneath the motion of itslimbs. In the moment of his vengeance and his power, the self-prizeddemigod was humbled to his real clay.  Far and wide along the soil wenta hoarse and rumbling sound--the curtains of the chamber shook as at theblast of a storm--the altar rocked--the tripod reeled, and high over theplace of contest, the column trembled and waved from side to side--thesable head of the goddess tottered and fell from its pedestal--and asthe Egyptian stooped above his intended victim, right upon his bendedform, right between the shoulder and the neck, struck the marble mass!The shock stretched him like the blow of death, at once, suddenly,without sound or motion, or semblance of life, upon the floor,apparently crushed by the very divinity he had impiously animated andinvoked!\'The Earth has preserved her children,\' said Glaucus, staggering to hisfeet.  \'Blessed be the dread convulsion!  Let us worship the providenceof the gods!\' He assisted Apaecides to rise, and then turned upward theface of Arbaces; it seemed locked as in death; blood gushed from theEgyptian\'s lips over his glittering robes; he fell heavily from the armsof Glaucus, and the red stream trickled slowly along the marble.  Againthe earth shook beneath their feet; they were forced to cling to eachother; the convulsion ceased as suddenly as it came; they tarried nolonger; Glaucus bore Ione lightly in his arms, and they fled from theunhallowed spot.  But scarce had they entered the garden than they weremet on all sides by flying and disordered groups of women and slaves,whose festive and glittering garments contrasted in mockery the solemnterror of the hour; they did not appear to heed the strangers--they wereoccupied only with their own fears.  After the tranquillity of sixteenyears, that burning and treacherous soil again menaced destruction; theyuttered but one cry, \'THE EARTHQUAKE!  THE EARTHQUAKE!\' and passingunmolested from the midst of them, Apaecides and his companions, withoutentering the house, hastened down one of the alleys, passed a small opengate, and there, sitting on a little mound over which spread the gloomof the dark green aloes, the moonlight fell on the bended figure of theblind girl--she was weeping bitterly.BOOK THE THIRDChapter ITHE FORUM OF THE POMPEIANS.  THE FIRST RUDE MACHINERY BY WHICH THE NEWERA OF THE WORLD WAS WROUGHT.IT was early noon, and the forum was crowded alike with the busy and theidle.  As at Paris at this day, so at that time in the cities of Italy,men lived almost wholly out of doors: the public buildings, the forum,the porticoes, the baths, the temples themselves, might be consideredtheir real homes; it was no wonder that they decorated so gorgeouslythese favorite places of resort--they felt for them a sort of domesticaffection as well as a public pride.  And animated was, indeed, theaspect of the forum of Pompeii at that time!  Along its broad pavement,composed of large flags of marble, were assembled various groups,conversing in that energetic fashion which appropriates a gesture toevery word, and which is still the characteristic of the people of thesouth.  Here, in seven stalls on one side the colonnade, sat themoney-changers, with their glittering heaps before them, and merchantsand seamen in various costumes crowding round their stalls.  On oneside, several men in long togas were seen bustling rapidly up to astately edifice, where the magistrates administered justice--these werethe lawyers, active, chattering, joking, and punning, as you may findthem at this day in Westminster.  In the centre of the space, pedestalssupported various statues, of which the most remarkable was the statelyform of Cicero.  Around the court ran a regular and symmetricalcolonnade of Doric architecture; and there several, whose business drewthem early to the place, were taking the slight morning repast whichmade an Italian breakfast, talking vehemently on the earthquake of thepreceding night as they dipped pieces of bread in their cups of dilutedwine.  In the open space, too, you might perceive various petty tradersexercising the arts of their calling.  Here one man was holding outribands to a fair dame from the country; another man was vaunting to astout farmer the excellence of his shoes; a third, a kind ofstall-restaurateur, still so common in the Italian cities, was supplyingmany a hungry mouth with hot messes from his small and itinerant stove,while--contrast strongly typical of the mingled bustle and intellect ofthe time--close by, a schoolmaster was expounding to his puzzled pupilsthe elements of the Latin grammar. A gallery above the portico, whichwas ascended by small wooden staircases, had also its throng; though, ashere the immediate business of the place was mainly carried on, itsgroups wore a more quiet and serious air.Every now and then the crowd below respectfully gave way as some senatorswept along to the Temple of Jupiter (which filled up one side of theforum, and was the senators\' hall of meeting), nodding with ostentatiouscondescension to such of his friends or clients as he distinguishedamongst the throng.  Mingling amidst the gay dresses of the betterorders you saw the hardy forms of the neighboring farmers, as they madetheir way to the public granaries.  Hard by the temple you caught a viewof the triumphal arch, and the long street beyond swarming withinhabitants; in one of the niches of the arch a fountain played,cheerily sparkling in the sunbeams; and above its cornice rose thebronzed and equestrian statue of Caligula, strongly contrasting the gaysummer skies.  Behind the stalls of the money-changers was that buildingnow called the Pantheon; and a crowd of the poorer Pompeians passedthrough the small vestibule which admitted to the interior, withpanniers under their arms, pressing on towards a platform, placedbetween two columns, where such provisions as the priests had rescuedfrom sacrifice were exposed for sale.At one of the public edifices appropriated to the business of the city,workmen were employed upon the columns, and you heard the noise of theirlabor every now and then rising above the hum of the multitude: thecolumns are unfinished to this day!All, then, united, nothing could exceed in variety the costumes, theranks, the manners, the occupations of the crowd--nothing could exceedthe bustle, the gaiety, the animation--where pleasure and commerce,idleness and labor, avarice and ambition, mingled in one gulf theirmotley rushing, yet harmonius, streams.Facing the steps of the Temple of Jupiter, with folded arms, and a knitand contemptuous brow, stood a man of about fifty years of age. Hisdress was remarkably plain--not so much from its material, as from theabsence of all those ornaments which were worn by the Pompeians of everyrank--partly from the love of show, partly, also, because they werechiefly wrought into those shapes deemed most efficacious in resistingthe assaults of magic and the influence of the evil eye.  His foreheadwas high and bald; the few locks that remained at the back of the headwere concealed by a sort of cowl, which made a part of his cloak, to beraised or lowered at pleasure, and was now drawn half-way over the head,as a protection from the rays of the sun. The color of his garments wasbrown, no popular hue with the Pompeians; all the usual admixtures ofscarlet or purple seemed carefully excluded.  His belt, or girdle,contained a small receptacle for ink, which hooked on to the girdle, astilus (or implement of writing), and tablets of no ordinary size.  Whatwas rather remarkable, the cincture held no purse, which was the almostindispensable appurtenance of the girdle, even when that purse had themisfortune to be empty!It was not often that the gay and egotistical Pompeians busiedthemselves with observing the countenances and actions of theirneighbors; but there was that in the lip and eye of this bystander soremarkably bitter and disdainful, as he surveyed the religiousprocession sweeping up the stairs of the temple, that it could not failto arrest the notice of many.\'Who is yon cynic?\' asked a merchant of his companion, a jeweller.\'It is Olinthus,\' replied the jeweller; \'a reputed Nazarene.\'The merchant shuddered.  \'A dread sect!\' said he, in a whispered andfearful voice.  \'It is said that when they meet at nights they alwayscommence their ceremonies by the murder of a new-born babe; they professa community of goods, too--the wretches!  A community of goods!  Whatwould become of merchants, or jewellers either, if such notions were infashion?\'\'That is very true,\' said the jeweller; \'besides, they wear nojewels--they mutter imprecations when they see a serpent; and at Pompeiiall our ornaments are serpentine.\'\'Do but observe,\' said a third, who was a fabricant of bronze, \'how yonNazarene scowls at the piety of the sacrificial procession. He ismurmuring curses on the temple, be sure.  Do you know, Celcinus, thatthis fellow, passing by my shop the other day, and seeing me employed ona statue of Minerva, told me with a frown that, had it been marble, hewould have broken it; but the bronze was too strong for him.  ""Break agoddess!"" said I.  ""A goddess!"" answered the atheist; ""it is a demon--anevil spirit!"" Then he passed on his way cursing.  Are such things to beborne?  What marvel that the earth heaved so fearfully last night,anxious to reject the atheist from her bosom?--An atheist, do I say?worse still--a scorner of the Fine Arts! Woe to us fabricants of bronze,if such fellows as this give the law to society!\'\'These are the incendiaries that burnt Rome under Nero,\' groaned thejeweller.While such were the friendly remarks provoked by the air and faith ofthe Nazarene, Olinthus himself became sensible of the effect he wasproducing; he turned his eyes round, and observed the intent faces ofthe accumulating throng, whispering as they gazed; and surveying themfor a moment with an expression, first of defiance and afterwards ofcompassion, he gathered his cloak round him and passed on, mutteringaudibly, \'Deluded idolaters!--did not last night\'s convulsion warn ye?Alas! how will ye meet the last day?\'The crowd that heard these boding words gave them differentinterpretations, according to their different shades of ignorance and offear; all, however, concurred in imagining them to convey some awfulimprecation.  They regarded the Christian as the enemy of mankind; theepithets they lavished upon him, of which \'Atheist\' was the most favoredand frequent, may serve, perhaps, to warn us, believers of that samecreed now triumphant, how we indulge the persecution of opinion Olinthusthen underwent, and how we apply to those whose notions differ from ourown the terms at that day lavished on the fathers of our faith.As Olinthus stalked through the crowd, and gained one of the moreprivate places of egress from the forum, he perceived gazing upon him apale and earnest countenance, which he was not slow to recognize.Wrapped in a pallium that partially concealed his sacred robes, theyoung Apaecides surveyed the disciple of that new and mysterious creed,to which at one time he had been half a convert.\'Is he, too, an impostor?  Does this man, so plain and simple in life,in garb, in mien--does he too, like Arbaces, make austerity the robe ofthe sensualist?  Does the veil of Vesta hide the vices of theprostitute?\'Olinthus, accustomed to men of all classes, and combining with theenthusiasm of his faith a profound experience of his kind, guessed,perhaps, by the index of the countenance, something of what passedwithin the breast of the priest.  He met the survey of Apaecides with asteady eye, and a brow of serene and open candour.\'Peace be with thee!\' said he, saluting Apaecides.\'Peace!\' echoed the priest, in so hollow a tone that it went at once tothe heart of the Nazarene.\'In that wish,\' continued Olinthus, \'all good things arecombined--without virtue thou canst not have peace.  Like the rainbow,Peace rests upon the earth, but its arch is lost in heaven.  Heavenbathes it in hues of light--it springs up amidst tears and clouds--it isa reflection of the Eternal Sun--it is an assurance of calm--it is thesign of a great covenant between Man and God.  Such peace, O young man!is the smile of the soul; it is an emanation from the distant orb ofimmortal light.  PEACE be with you!\'\'Alas!\' began Apaecides, when he caught the gaze of the curiousloiterers, inquisitive to know what could possibly be the theme ofconversation between a reputed Nazarene and a priest of Isis.  Hestopped short, and then added in a low tone: \'We cannot converse here, Iwill follow thee to the banks of the river; there is a walk which atthis time is usually deserted and solitary.\'Olinthus bowed assent.  He passed through the streets with a hasty step,but a quick and observant eye.  Every now and then he exchanged asignificant glance, a slight sign, with some passenger, whose garbusually betokened the wearer to belong to the humbler classes; forChristianity was in this the type of all other and less mightyrevolutions--the grain of mustard-seed was in the heart of the lowly.Amidst the huts of poverty and labor, the vast stream which afterwardspoured its broad waters beside the cities and palaces of earth took itsneglected source.Chapter IITHE NOONDAY EXCURSION ON THE CAMPANIAN SEAS.\'BUT tell me, Glaucus,\' said Ione, as they glided down the ripplingSarnus in their boat of pleasure, \'how camest thou with Apaecides to myrescue from that bad man?\'\'Ask Nydia yonder,\' answered the Athenian, pointing to the blind girl,who sat at a little distance from them, leaning pensively over her lyre;\'she must have thy thanks, not we.  It seems that she came to my house,and, finding me from home, sought thy brother in his temple; heaccompanied her to Arbaces; on their way they encountered me, with acompany of friends, whom thy kind letter had given me a spirit cheerfulenough to join.  Nydia\'s quick ear detected my voice--a few wordssufficed to make me the companion of Apaecides; I told not my associateswhy I left them--could I trust thy name to their light tongues andgossiping opinion?--Nydia led us to the garden gate, by which weafterwards bore thee--we entered, and were about to plunge into themysteries of that evil house, when we heard thy cry in anotherdirection.  Thou knowest the rest.\'Ione blushed deeply.  She then raised her eyes to those of Glaucus, andhe felt all the thanks she could not utter.  \'Come hither, my Nydia,\'said she, tenderly, to the Thessalian.\'Did I not tell thee that thou shouldst be my sister and friend? Hastthou not already been more?--my guardian, my preserver!\'\'It is nothing,\' answered Nydia coldly, and without stirring.\'Ah! I forgot,\' continued Ione, \'I should come to thee\'; and she movedalong the benches till she reached the place where Nydia sat, andflinging her arms caressingly round her, covered her cheeks with kisses.Nydia was that morning paler than her wont, and her countenance greweven more wan and colorless as she submitted to the embrace of thebeautiful Neapolitan.  \'But how camest thou, Nydia,\' whispered Ione, \'tosurmise so faithfully the danger I was exposed to?  Didst thou knowaught of the Egyptian?\'\'Yes, I knew of his vices.\'\'And how?\'\'Noble Ione, I have been a slave to the vicious--those whom I servedwere his minions.\'\'And thou hast entered his house since thou knewest so well that privateentrance?\'\'I have played on my lyre to Arbaces,\' answered the Thessalian, withembarrassment.\'And thou hast escaped the contagion from which thou hast saved Ione?\'returned the Neapolitan, in a voice too low for the ear of Glaucus.\'Noble Ione, I have neither beauty nor station; I am a child, and aslave, and blind.  The despicable are ever safe.\'It was with a pained, and proud, and indignant tone that Nydia made thishumble reply; and Ione felt that she only wounded Nydia by pursuing thesubject.  She remained silent, and the bark now floated into the sea.\'Confess that I was right, Ione,\' said Glaucus, \'in prevailing on theenot to waste this beautiful noon in thy chamber--confess that I wasright.\'\'Thou wert right, Glaucus,\' said Nydia, abruptly.\'The dear child speaks for thee,\' returned the Athenian.  \'But permit meto move opposite to thee, or our light boat will be over-balanced.\'So saying, he took his seat exactly opposite to Ione, and leaningforward, he fancied that it was her breath, and not the winds of summer,that flung fragrance over the sea.\'Thou wert to tell me,\' said Glaucus, \'why for so many days thy door wasclosed to me?\'\'Oh, think of it no more!\' answered Ione, quickly; \'I gave my ear towhat I now know was the malice of slander.\'\'And my slanderer was the Egyptian?\'Ione\'s silence assented to the question.\'His motives are sufficiently obvious.\'\'Talk not of him,\' said Ione, covering her face with her hands, as if toshut out his very thought.\'Perhaps he may be already by the banks of the slow Styx,\' resumedGlaucus; \'yet in that case we should probably have heard of his death.Thy brother, methinks, hath felt the dark influence of his gloomy soul.When we arrived last night at thy house he left me abruptly. Will heever vouchsafe to be my friend?\'\'He is consumed with some secret care,\' answered Ione, tearfully.\'Would that we could lure him from himself!  Let us join in that tenderoffice.\'\'He shall be my brother,\' returned the Greek.\'How calmly,\' said Ione, rousing herself from the gloom into which herthoughts of Apaecides had plunged her--\'how calmly the clouds seem torepose in heaven; and yet you tell me, for I knew it not myself, thatthe earth shook beneath us last night.\'\'It did, and more violently, they say, than it has done since the greatconvulsion sixteen years ago: the land we live in yet nurses mysteriousterror; and the reign of Pluto, which spreads beneath our burningfields, seems rent with unseen commotion.  Didst thou not feel the earthquake, Nydia, where thou wert seated last night?  and was it not thefear that it occasioned thee that made thee weep?\'\'I felt the soil creep and heave beneath me, like some monstrousserpent,\' answered Nydia; \'but as I saw nothing, I did not fear: Iimagined the convulsion to be a spell of the Egyptian\'s.  They say hehas power over the elements.\'\'Thou art a Thessalian, my Nydia,\' replied Glaucus, \'and hast a nationalright to believe in magic.\'Magic!--who doubts it?\' answered Nydia, simply: \'dost thou?\'\'Until last night (when a necromantic prodigy did indeed appal me),methinks I was not credulous in any other magic save that of love!\' saidGlaucus, in a tremulous voice, and fixing his eyes on Ione.\'Ah!\' said Nydia, with a sort of shiver, and she awoke mechanically afew pleasing notes from her lyre; the sound suited well the tranquilityof the waters, and the sunny stillness of the noon.\'Play to us, dear Nydia, said Glaucus--\'play and give us one of thineold Thessalian songs: whether it be of magic or not, as thou wilt--letit, at least, be of love!\'\'Of love!\' repeated Nydia, raising her large, wandering eyes, that everthrilled those who saw them with a mingled fear and pity; you couldnever familiarize yourself to their aspect: so strange did it seem thatthose dark wild orbs were ignorant of the day, and either so fixed wastheir deep mysterious gaze, or so restless and perturbed their glance,that you felt, when you encountered them, that same vague, and chilling,and half-preternatural impression, which comes over you in the presenceof the insane--of those who, having a life outwardly like your own, havea life within life--dissimilar--unsearchable--unguessed!\'Will you that I should sing of love?\' said she, fixing those eyes uponGlaucus.\'Yes,\' replied he, looking down.She moved a little way from the arm of Ione, still cast round her, as ifthat soft embrace embarrassed; and placing her light and gracefulinstrument on her knee, after a short prelude, she sang the followingstrain:               NYDIA\'S LOVE-SONG                     I         The Wind and the Beam loved the Rose,           And the Rose loved one;          For who recks the wind where it blows?          Or loves not the sun?                     II         None knew whence the humble Wind stole,           Poor sport of the skies--         None dreamt that the Wind had a soul,           In its mournful sighs!                    III         Oh, happy Beam! how canst thou prove           That bright love of thine?          In thy light is the proof of thy love.           Thou hast but--to shine!                     IV         How its love can the Wind reveal?           Unwelcome its sigh;          Mute--mute to its Rose let it steal--          Its proof is--to die!\'Thou singest but sadly, sweet girl,\' said Glaucus; \'thy youth onlyfeels as yet the dark shadow of Love; far other inspiration doth hewake, when he himself bursts and brightens upon us.\'I sing as I was taught,\' replied Nydia, sighing.\'Thy master was love-crossed, then--try thy hand at a gayer air. Nay,girl, give the instrument to me.\' As Nydia obeyed, her hand touched his,and, with that slight touch, her breast heaved--her cheek flushed.  Ioneand Glaucus, occupied with each other, perceived not those signs ofstrange and premature emotions, which preyed upon a heart that,nourished by imagination, dispensed with hope.And now, broad, blue, bright, before them, spread that halcyon sea, fairas at this moment, seventeen centuries from that date, I behold itrippling on the same divinest shores.  Clime that yet enervates with asoft and Circean spell--that moulds us insensibly, mysteriously, intoharmony with thyself, banishing the thought of austerer labor, thevoices of wild ambition, the contests and the roar of life; filling uswith gentle and subduing dreams, making necessary to our nature thatwhich is its least earthly portion, so that the very air inspires uswith the yearning and thirst of love. Whoever visits thee seems to leaveearth and its harsh cares behind--to enter by the Ivory gate into theLand of Dreams.  The young and laughing Hours of the PRESENT--the Hours,those children of Saturn, which he hungers ever to devour, seem snatchedfrom his grasp.  The past--the future--are forgotten; we enjoy but thebreathing time. Flower of the world\'s garden--Fountain of Delight--Italyof Italy--beautiful, benign Campania!--vain were, indeed, the Titans, ifon this spot they yet struggled for another heaven!  Here, if God meantthis working-day life for a perpetual holiday, who would not sigh todwell for ever--asking nothing, hoping nothing, fearing nothing, whilethy skies shine over him--while thy seas sparkle at his feet--whilethine air brought him sweet messages from the violet and the orange--andwhile the heart, resigned to--beating with--but one emotion, could findthe lips and the eyes, which flatter it (vanity of vanities!) that lovecan defy custom, and be eternal?It was then in this clime--on those seas, that the Athenian gazed upon aface that might have suited the nymph, the spirit of the place: feedinghis eyes on the changeful roses of that softest cheek, happy beyond thehappiness of common life, loving, and knowing himself beloved.In the tale of human passion, in past ages, there is something ofinterest even in the remoteness of the time.  We love to feel within usthe bond which unites the most distant era--men, nations, customsperish; THE AFFECTIONS ARE IMMORTAL!--they are the sympathies whichunite the ceaseless generations.  The past lives again, when we lookupon its emotions--it lives in our own!  That which was, ever is!  Themagician\'s gift, that revives the dead--that animates the dust offorgotten graves, is not in the author\'s skill--it is in the heart ofthe reader!Still vainly seeking the eyes of Ione, as, half downcast, half averted,they shunned his own, the Athenian, in a low and soft voice, thusexpressed the feelings inspired by happier thoughts than those which hadcolored the song of Nydia. THE SONG OF GLAUCUS                    I   As the bark floateth on o\'er the summer-lit sea,    Floats my heart o\'er the deeps of its passion for thee;    All lost in the space, without terror it glides,    For bright with thy soul is the face of the tides.    Now heaving, now hush\'d, is that passionate ocean,    As it catches thy smile or thy sighs;    And the twin-stars that shine on the wanderer\'s devotion    Its guide and its god--are thine eyes!                    II   The bark may go down, should the cloud sweep above,    For its being is bound to the light of thy love.    As thy faith and thy smile are its life and its joy,    So thy frown or thy change are the storms that destroy.    Ah! sweeter to sink while the sky is serene,     If time hath a change for thy heart!    If to live be to weep over what thou hast been,     Let me die while I know what thou art!As the last words of the song trembled over the sea, Ione raised herlooks--they met those of her lover.  Happy Nydia!--happy in thyaffliction, that thou couldst not see that fascinated and charmed gaze,that said so much--that made the eye the voice of the soul--thatpromised the impossibility of change!But, though the Thessalian could not detect that gaze, she divined itsmeaning by their silence--by their sighs.  She pressed her hands lightlyacross her breast, as if to keep down its bitter and jealous thoughts;and then she hastened to speak--for that silence was intolerable to her.\'After all, O Glaucus!\' said she, \'there is nothing very mirthful inyour strain!\'\'Yet I meant it to be so, when I took up thy lyre, pretty one. Perhapshappiness will not permit us to be mirthful.\'\'How strange is it,\' said Ione, changing a conversation which oppressedher while it charmed--\'that for the last several days yonder cloud hashung motionless over Vesuvius!  Yet not indeed motionless, for sometimesit changes its form; and now methinks it looks like some vast giant,with an arm outstretched over the city.  Dost thou see the likeness--oris it only to my fancy?\'\'Fair Ione!  I see it also.  It is astonishingly distinct.  The giantseems seated on the brow of the mountain, the different shades of thecloud appear to form a white robe that sweeps over its vast breast andlimbs; it seems to gaze with a steady face upon the city below, to pointwith one hand, as thou sayest, over its glittering streets, and to raisethe other (dost thou note it?) towards the higher heaven. It is like theghost of some huge Titan brooding over the beautiful world he lost;sorrowful for the past--yet with something of menace for the future.\'\'Could that mountain have any connection with the last night\'searthquake? They say that, ages ago, almost in the earliest era oftradition, it gave forth fires as AEtna still.  Perhaps the flames yetlurk and dart beneath.\'\'It is possible,\' said Glaucus, musingly.\'Thou sayest thou art slow to believe in magic,\' said Nydia, suddenly.\'I have heard that a potent witch dwells amongst the scorched caverns ofthe mountain, and yon cloud may be the dim shadow of the demon sheconfers with.\'\'Thou art full of the romance of thy native Thessaly,\' said Glaucus;\'and a strange mixture of sense and all conflicting superstitions.\'\'We are ever superstitious in the dark,\' replied Nydia.  \'Tell me,\' sheadded, after a slight pause, \'tell me, O Glaucus! do all that arebeautiful resemble each other?  They say you are beautiful, and Ionealso.  Are your faces then the same?  I fancy not, yet it ought to beso.\'\'Fancy no such grievous wrong to Ione,\' answered Glaucus, laughing.\'But we do not, alas! resemble each other, as the homely and thebeautiful sometimes do.  Ione\'s hair is dark, mine light; Ione\'s eyesare--what color, Ione?  I cannot see, turn them to me.  Oh, are theyblack? no, they are too soft. Are they blue? no, they are too deep: theychange with every ray of the sun--I know not their color: but mine,sweet Nydia, are grey, and bright only when Ione shines on them!  Ione\'scheek is...\'\'I do not understand one word of thy description,\' interrupted Nydia,peevishly.  \'I comprehend only that you do not resemble each other, andI am glad of it.\'\'Why, Nydia?\' said Ione.Nydia colored slightly.  \'Because,\' she replied, coldly, \'I have alwaysimagined you under different forms, and one likes to know one is right.\'\'And what hast thou imagined Glaucus to resemble?\' asked Ione, softly.\'Music!\' replied Nydia, looking down.\'Thou art right,\' thought Ione.\'And what likeness hast thou ascribed to Ione?\'\'I cannot tell yet,\' answered the blind girl; \'I have not yet known herlong enough to find a shape and sign for my guesses.\'\'I will tell thee, then,\' said Glaucus, passionately; \'she is like thesun that warms--like the wave that refreshes.\'\'The sun sometimes scorches, and the wave sometimes drowns,\' answeredNydia.\'Take then these roses,\' said Glaucus; \'let their fragrance suggest tothee Ione.\'\'Alas, the roses will fade!\' said the Neapolitan, archly.Thus conversing, they wore away the hours; the lovers, conscious only ofthe brightness and smiles of love; the blind girl feeling only itsdarkness--its tortures--the fierceness of jealousy and its woe!And now, as they drifted on, Glaucus once more resumed the lyre, andwoke its strings with a careless hand to a strain, so wildly and gladlybeautiful, that even Nydia was aroused from her reverie, and uttered acry of admiration.\'Thou seest, my child,\' cried Glaucus, \'that I can yet redeem thecharacter of love\'s music, and that I was wrong in saying happinesscould not be gay. Listen, Nydia! listen, dear Ione! and hear:             THE BIRTH OF LOVE                    I         Like a Star in the seas above,             Like a Dream to the waves of sleep--        Up--up--THE INCARNATE LOVE--            She rose from the charmed deep!          And over the Cyprian Isle          The skies shed their silent smile;          And the Forest\'s green heart was rife          With the stir of the gushing life--         The life that had leap\'d to birth,          In the veins of the happy earth!                Hail! oh, hail!          The dimmest sea-cave below thee,             The farthest sky-arch above,          In their innermost stillness know thee:             And heave with the Birth of Love!                Gale! soft Gale!          Thou comest on thy silver winglets,             From thy home in the tender west,          Now fanning her golden ringlets,             Now hush\'d on her heaving breast.          And afar on the murmuring sand,          The Seasons wait hand in hand          To welcome thee, Birth Divine,          To the earth which is henceforth thine.                    II         Behold! how she kneels in the shell,          Bright pearl in its floating cell!          Behold! how the shell\'s rose-hues,             The cheek and the breast of snow,          And the delicate limbs suffuse,             Like a blush, with a bashful glow.          Sailing on, slowly sailing             O\'er the wild water;          All hail! as the fond light is hailing             Her daughter,                   All hail!          We are thine, all thine evermore:          Not a leaf on the laughing shore,          Not a wave on the heaving sea,             Nor a single sigh             In the boundless sky,          But is vow\'d evermore to thee!                   III         And thou, my beloved one--thou,           As I gaze on thy soft eyes now,          Methinks from their depths I view          The Holy Birth born anew;          Thy lids are the gentle cell             Where the young Love blushing lies;          See! she breaks from the mystic shell,             She comes from thy tender eyes!                Hail! all hail!          She comes, as she came from the sea,          To my soul as it looks on thee;             She comes, she comes!          She comes, as she came from the sea,          To my soul as it looks on thee!                Hail! all hail!Chapter IIITHE CONGREGATION.FOLLOWED by Apaecides, the Nazarene gained the side of the Sarnus--thatriver, which now has shrunk into a petty stream, then rushed gaily intothe sea, covered with countless vessels, and reflecting on its waves thegardens, the vines, the palaces, and the temples of Pompeii.  From itsmore noisy and frequented banks, Olinthus directed his steps to a pathwhich ran amidst a shady vista of trees, at the distance of a few pacesfrom the river.  This walk was in the evening a favorite resort of thePompeians, but during the heat and business of the day was seldomvisited, save by some groups of playful children, some meditative poet,or some disputative philosophers.  At the side farthest from the river,frequent copses of box interspersed the more delicate and evanescentfoliage, and these were cut into a thousand quaint shapes, sometimesinto the forms of fauns and satyrs, sometimes into the mimicry ofEgyptian pyramids, sometimes into the letters that composed the name ofa popular or eminent citizen.  Thus the false taste is equally ancientas the pure; and the retired traders of Hackney and Paddington, acentury ago, were little aware, perhaps, that in their tortured yews andsculptured box, they found their models in the most polished period ofRoman antiquity, in the gardens of Pompeii, and the villas of thefastidious Pliny.This walk now, as the noonday sun shone perpendicularly through thechequered leaves, was entirely deserted; at least no other forms thanthose of Olinthus and the priest infringed upon the solitude. They satthemselves on one of the benches, placed at intervals between the trees,and facing the faint breeze that came languidly from the river, whosewaves danced and sparkled before them--a singular and contrasted pair;the believer in the latest--the priest of the most ancient--worship ofthe world!\'Since thou leftst me so abruptly,\' said Olinthus, \'hast thou beenhappy? has thy heart found contentment under these priestly robes? hastthou, still yearning for the voice of God, heard it whisper comfort tothee from the oracles of Isis?  That sigh, that averted countenance,give me the answer my soul predicted.\'\'Alas!\' answered Apaecides, sadly, \'thou seest before thee a wretchedand distracted man!  From my childhood upward I have idolized the dreamsof virtue!  I have envied the holiness of men who, in caves and lonelytemples, have been admitted to the companionship of beings above theworld; my days have been consumed with feverish and vague desires; mynights with mocking but solemn visions.  Seduced by the mysticprophecies of an impostor, I have indued these robes;--my nature (Iconfess it to thee frankly)--my nature has revolted at what I have seenand been doomed to share in! Searching after truth, I have become butthe minister of falsehoods. On the evening in which we last met, I wasbuoyed by hopes created by that same impostor, whom I ought already tohave better known.  I have--no matter--no matter! suffice it, I haveadded perjury and sin to rashness and to sorrow.  The veil is now rentfor ever from my eyes; I behold a villain where I obeyed a demigod; theearth darkens in my sight; I am in the deepest abyss of gloom; I knownot if there be gods above; if we are the things of chance; if beyondthe bounded and melancholy present there is annihilation or anhereafter--tell me, then, thy faith; solve me these doubts, if thou hastindeed the power!\'\'I do not marvel,\' answered the Nazarene, \'that thou hast thus erred, orthat thou art thus sceptic.  Eighty years ago there was no assurance toman of God, or of a certain and definite future beyond the grave.  Newlaws are declared to him who has ears--a heaven, a true Olympus, isrevealed to him who has eyes--heed then, and listen.\'And with all the earnestness of a man believing ardently himself, andzealous to convert, the Nazarene poured forth to Apaecides theassurances of Scriptural promise.  He spoke first of the sufferings andmiracles of Christ--he wept as he spoke: he turned next to the gloriesof the Saviour\'s Ascension--to the clear predictions of Revelation.  Hedescribed that pure and unsensual heaven destined to the virtuous--thosefires and torments that were the doom of guilt.The doubts which spring up to the mind of later reasoners, in theimmensity of the sacrifice of God to man, were not such as would occurto an early heathen.  He had been accustomed to believe that the godshad lived upon earth, and taken upon themselves the forms of men; hadshared in human passions, in human labours, and in human misfortunes.What was the travail of his own Alcmena\'s son, whose altars now smokedwith the incense of countless cities, but a toil for the human race?Had not the great Dorian Apollo expiated a mystic sin by descending tothe grave?  Those who were the deities of heaven had been the lawgiversor benefactors on earth, and gratitude had led to worship.  It seemedtherefore, to the heathen, a doctrine neither new nor strange, thatChrist had been sent from heaven, that an immortal had indued mortality,and tasted the bitterness of death. And the end for which He thus toiledand thus suffered--how far more glorious did it seem to Apaecides thanthat for which the deities of old had visited the nether world, andpassed through the gates of death!  Was it not worthy of a God todescend to these dim valleys, in order to clear up the clouds gatheredover the dark mount beyond--to satisfy the doubts of sages--to convertspeculation into certainty--by example to point out the rules oflife--by revelation to solve the enigma of the grave--and to prove thatthe soul did not yearn in vain when it dreamed of an immortality?  Inthis last was the great argument of those lowly men destined to convertthe earth.  As nothing is more flattering to the pride and the hopes ofman than the belief in a future state, so nothing could be more vagueand confused than the notions of the heathen sages upon that mysticsubject. Apaecides had already learned that the faith of thephilosophers was not that of the herd; that if they secretly professed acreed in some diviner power, it was not the creed which they thought itwise to impart to the community.  He had already learned, that even thepriest ridiculed what he preached to the people--that the notions of thefew and the many were never united.  But, in this new faith, it seemedto him that philosopher, priest, and people, the expounders of thereligion and its followers, were alike accordant: they did not speculateand debate upon immortality, they spoke of as a thing certain andassured; the magnificence of the promise dazzled him--its consolationssoothed. For the Christian faith made its early converts among sinners!many of its fathers and its martyrs were those who had felt thebitterness of vice, and who were therefore no longer tempted by itsfalse aspect from the paths of an austere and uncompromising virtue.All the assurances of this healing faith invited to repentance--theywere peculiarly adapted to the bruised and sore of spirit! the veryremorse which Apaecides felt for his late excesses, made him incline toone who found holiness in that remorse, and who whispered of the joy inheaven over one sinner that repenteth.\'Come,\' said the Nazarene, as he perceived the effect he had produced,\'come to the humble hall in which we meet--a select and a chosen few;listen there to our prayers; note the sincerity of our repentant tears;mingle in our simple sacrifice--not of victims, nor of garlands, butoffered by white-robed thoughts upon the altar of the heart.  Theflowers that we lay there are imperishable--they bloom over us when weare no more; nay, they accompany us beyond the grave, they spring upbeneath our feet in heaven, they delight us with an eternal odor, forthey are of the soul, they partake of its nature; these offerings aretemptations overcome, and sins repented. Come, oh come! lose not anothermoment; prepare already for the great, the awful journey, from darknessto light, from sorrow to bliss, from corruption to immortality!  This isthe day of the Lord the Son, a day that we have set apart for ourdevotions.  Though we meet usually at night, yet some amongst us aregathered together even now.  What joy, what triumph, will be with usall, if we can bring one stray lamb into the sacred fold!\'There seemed to Apaecides, so naturally pure of heart, somethingineffably generous and benign in that spirit of conversation whichanimated Olinthus--a spirit that found its own bliss in the happiness ofothers--that sought in its wide sociality to make companions foreternity.  He was touched, softened, and subdued.  He was not in thatmood which can bear to be left alone; curiosity, too, mingled with hispurer stimulants--he was anxious to see those rites of which so manydark and contradictory rumours were afloat.  He paused a moment, lookedover his garb, thought of Arbaces, shuddered with horror, lifted hiseyes to the broad brow of the Nazarene, intent, anxious, watchful--butfor his benefits, for his salvation!  He drew his cloak round him, so aswholly to conceal his robes, and said, \'Lead on, I follow thee.\'Olinthus pressed his hand joyfully, and then descending to the riverside, hailed one of the boats that plyed there constantly; they enteredit; an awning overhead, while it sheltered them from the sun, screenedalso their persons from observation: they rapidly skimmed the wave.From one of the boats that passed them floated a soft music, and itsprow was decorated with flowers--it was gliding towards the sea.\'So,\' said Olinthus, sadly, \'unconscious and mirthful in theirdelusions, sail the votaries of luxury into the great ocean of storm andshipwreck! we pass them, silent and unnoticed, to gain the land.\'Apaecides, lifting his eyes, caught through the aperture in the awning aglimpse of the face of one of the inmates of that gay bark--it was theface of Ione.  The lovers were embarked on the excursion at which wehave been made present.  The priest sighed, and once more sunk back uponhis seat. They reached the shore where, in the suburbs, an alley ofsmall and mean houses stretched towards the bank; they dismissed theboat, landed, and Olinthus, preceding the priest, threaded the labyrinthof lanes, and arrived at last at the closed door of a habitationsomewhat larger than its neighbors.  He knocked thrice--the door wasopened and closed again, as Apaecides followed his guide across thethreshold.They passed a deserted atrium, and gained an inner chamber of moderatesize, which, when the door was closed, received its only light from asmall window cut over the door itself.  But, halting at the threshold ofthis chamber, and knocking at the door, Olinthus said, \'Peace be withyou!\' A voice from within returned, \'Peace with whom?\' \'The Faithful!\'answered Olinthus, and the door opened; twelve or fourteen persons weresitting in a semicircle, silent, and seemingly absorbed in thought, andopposite to a crucifix rudely carved in wood.They lifted up their eyes when Olinthus entered, without speaking; theNazarene himself, before he accosted them, knelt suddenly down, and byhis moving lips, and his eyes fixed steadfastly on the crucifix,Apaecides saw that he prayed inly.  This rite performed, Olinthus turnedto the congregation--\'Men and brethren,\' said he, \'start not to beholdamongst you a priest of Isis; he hath sojourned with the blind, but theSpirit hath fallen on him--he desires to see, to hear, and tounderstand.\'\'Let him,\' said one of the assembly; and Apaecides beheld in the speakera man still younger than himself, of a countenance equally worn andpallid, of an eye which equally spoke of the restless and fieryoperations of a working mind.\'Let him,\' repeated a second voice, and he who thus spoke was in theprime of manhood; his bronzed skin and Asiatic features bespoke him ason of Syria--he had been a robber in his youth.\'Let him,\' said a third voice; and the priest, again turning to regardthe speaker, saw an old man with a long grey beard, whom he recognizedas a slave to the wealthy Diomed.\'Let him,\' repeated simultaneously the rest--men who, with twoexceptions, were evidently of the inferior ranks.  In these exceptions,Apaecides noted an officer of the guard, and an Alexandrian merchant.\'We do not,\' recommenced Olinthus--\'we do not bind you to secrecy; weimpose on you no oaths (as some of our weaker brethren would do) not tobetray us. It is true, indeed, that there is no absolute law against us;but the multitude, more savage than their rulers, thirst for our lives.So, my friends, when Pilate would have hesitated, it was the people whoshouted ""Christ to the cross!"" But we bind you not to our safety--no!Betray us to the crowd--impeach, calumniate, malign us if you will--weare above death, we should walk cheerfully to the den of the lion, orthe rack of the torturer--we can trample down the darkness of the grave,and what is death to a criminal is eternity to the Christian.\'A low and applauding murmur ran through the assembly.\'Thou comest amongst us as an examiner, mayest thou remain a convert!Our religion? you behold it!  Yon cross our sole image, yon scroll themysteries of our Caere and Eleusis!  Our morality? it is in ourlives!--sinners we all have been; who now can accuse us of a crime? wehave baptized ourselves from the past.  Think not that this is of us, itis of God.  Approach, Medon,\' beckoning to the old slave who had spokenthird for the admission of Apaecides, \'thou art the sole man amongst uswho is not free.  But in heaven, the last shall be first: so with us.Unfold your scroll, read and explain.\'Useless would it be for us to accompany the lecture of Medon, or thecomments of the congregation.  Familiar now are those doctrines, thenstrange and new.  Eighteen centuries have left us little to expound uponthe lore of Scripture or the life of Christ.  To us, too, there wouldseem little congenial in the doubts that occurred to a heathen priest,and little learned in the answers they receive from men uneducated,rude, and simple, possessing only the knowledge that they were greaterthan they seemed.There was one thing that greatly touched the Neapolitan: when thelecture was concluded, they heard a very gentle knock at the door; thepassword was given, and replied to; the door opened, and two youngchildren, the eldest of whom might have told its seventh year, enteredtimidly; they were the children of the master of the house, that darkand hardy Syrian, whose youth had been spent in pillage and bloodshed.The eldest of the congregation (it was that old slave) opened to themhis arms; they fled to the shelter--they crept to his breast--and hishard features smiled as he caressed them.  And then these bold andfervent men, nursed in vicissitude, beaten by the rough winds oflife--men of mailed and impervious fortitude, ready to affront a world,prepared for torment and armed for death--men, who presented allimaginable contrast to the weak nerves, the light hearts, the tenderfragility of childhood, crowded round the infants, smoothing theirrugged brows and composing their bearded lips to kindly and fosteringsmiles: and then the old man opened the scroll and he taught the infantsto repeat after him that beautiful prayer which we still dedicate to theLord, and still teach to our children; and then he told them, in simplephrase, of God\'s love to the young, and how not a sparrow falls but Hiseye sees it.  This lovely custom of infant initiation was long cherishedby the early Church, in memory of the words which said, \'Suffer littlechildren to come unto me, and forbid them not\'; and was perhaps theorigin of the superstitious calumny which ascribed to the Nazarenes thecrime which the Nazarenes, when victorious, attributed to the Jew, viz.the decoying children to hideous rites, at which they were secretlyimmolated.And the stern paternal penitent seemed to feel in the innocence of hischildren a return into early life--life ere yet it sinned: he followedthe motion of their young lips with an earnest gaze; he smiled as theyrepeated, with hushed and reverent looks, the holy words: and when thelesson was done, and they ran, released, and gladly to his knee, heclasped them to his breast, kissed them again and again, and tearsflowed fast down his cheek--tears, of which it would have beenimpossible to trace the source, so mingled they were with joy andsorrow, penitence and hope--remorse for himself and love for them!Something, I say, there was in this scene which peculiarly affectedApaecides; and, in truth, it is difficult to conceive a ceremony moreappropriate to the religion of benevolence, more appealing to thehousehold and everyday affections, striking a more sensitive chord inthe human breast.It was at this time that an inner door opened gently, and a very old manentered the chamber, leaning on a staff.  At his presence, the wholecongregation rose; there was an expression of deep, affectionate respectupon every countenance; and Apaecides, gazing on his countenance, feltattracted towards him by an irresistible sympathy.  No man ever lookedupon that face without love; for there had dwelt the smile of the Deity,the incarnation of divinest love--and the glory of the smile had neverpassed away.\'My children, God be with you!\' said the old man, stretching his arms;and as he spoke the infants ran to his knee.  He sat down, and theynestled fondly to his bosom.  It was beautiful to see that mingling ofthe extremes of life--the rivers gushing from their early source--themajestic stream gliding to the ocean of eternity!  As the light ofdeclining day seems to mingle earth and heaven, making the outline ofeach scarce visible, and blending the harsh mountain-tops with the sky,even so did the smile of that benign old age appear to hallow the aspectof those around, to blend together the strong distinctions of varyingyears, and to diffuse over infancy and manhood the light of that heaveninto which it must so soon vanish and be lost.\'Father,\' said Olinthus, \'thou on whose form the miracle of the Redeemerworked; thou who wert snatched from the grave to become the livingwitness of His mercy and His power; behold! a stranger in our meeting--anew lamb gathered to the fold!\'\'Let me bless him,\' said the old man: the throng gave way. Apaecidesapproached him as by an instinct: he fell on his knees before him--theold man laid his hand on the priest\'s head, and blessed him, but notaloud.  As his lips moved, his eyes were upturned, and tears--thosetears that good men only shed in the hope of happiness toanother--flowed fast down his cheeks.The children were on either side of the convert; his heart wastheirs--he had become as one of them--to enter into the kingdom ofHeaven.Chapter IVTHE STREAM OF LOVE RUNS ON.  WHITHER?DAYS are like years in the love of the young, when no bar, no obstacle,is between their hearts--when the sun shines, and the course runssmooth--when their love is prosperous and confessed.  Ione no longerconcealed from Glaucus the attachment she felt for him, and their talknow was only of their love.  Over the rapture of the present the hopesof the future glowed like the heaven above the gardens of spring.  Theywent in their trustful thoughts far down the stream of time: they laidout the chart of their destiny to come; they suffered the light ofto-day to suffuse the morrow. In the youth of their hearts it seemed asif care, and change, and death, were as things unknown.  Perhaps theyloved each other the more because the condition of the world left toGlaucus no aim and no wish but love; because the distractions common infree states to men\'s affections existed not for the Athenian; becausehis country wooed him not to the bustle of civil life; because ambitionfurnished no counterpoise to love: and, therefore, over their schemesand projects, love only reigned.  In the iron age they imaginedthemselves of the golden, doomed only to live and to love.To the superficial observer, who interests himself only in charactersstrongly marked and broadly colored, both the lovers may seem of tooslight and commonplace a mould: in the delineation of characterspurposely subdued, the reader sometimes imagines that there is a want ofcharacter; perhaps, indeed, I wrong the real nature of these two loversby not painting more impressively their stronger individualities.  Butin dwelling so much on their bright and birdlike existence, I aminfluenced almost insensibly by the forethought of the changes thatawait them, and for which they were so ill prepared.  It was this verysoftness and gaiety of life that contrasted most strongly thevicissitudes of their coming fate.  For the oak without fruit orblossom, whose hard and rugged heart is fitted for the storm, there isless fear than for the delicate branches of the myrtle, and the laughingclusters of the vine.They had now advanced far into August--the next month their marriage wasfixed, and the threshold of Glaucus was already wreathed with garlands;and nightly, by the door of Ione, he poured forth the rich libations.He existed no longer for his gay companions; he was ever with Ione.  Inthe mornings they beguiled the sun with music: in the evenings theyforsook the crowded haunts of the gay for excursions on the water, oralong the fertile and vine-clad plains that lay beneath the fatal mountof Vesuvius.  The earth shook no more; the lively Pompeians forgot eventhat there had gone forth so terrible a warning of their approachingdoom.  Glaucus imagined that convulsion, in the vanity of his heathenreligion, an especial interposition of the gods, less in behalf of hisown safety than that of Ione.  He offered up the sacrifices of gratitudeat the temples of his faith; and even the altar of Isis was covered withhis votive garlands--as to the prodigy of the animated marble, heblushed at the effect it had produced on him.  He believed it, indeed,to have been wrought by the magic of man; but the result convinced himthat it betokened not the anger of a goddess.Of Arbaces, they heard only that he still lived; stretched on the bed ofsuffering, he recovered slowly from the effect of the shock he hadsustained--he left the lovers unmolested--but it was only to brood overthe hour and the method of revenge.Alike in their mornings at the house of Ione, and in their eveningexcursions, Nydia was usually their constant, and often their solecompanion.  They did not guess the secret fires which consumed her--theabrupt freedom with which she mingled in their conversation--hercapricious and often her peevish moods found ready indulgence in therecollection of the service they owed her, and their compassion for heraffliction.  They felt an interest in her, perhaps the greater and moreaffectionate from the very strangeness and waywardness of her nature,her singular alternations of passion and softness--the mixture ofignorance and genius--of delicacy and rudeness--of the quick humors ofthe child, and the proud calmness of the woman.  Although she refused toaccept of freedom, she was constantly suffered to be free; she wentwhere she listed; no curb was put either on her words or actions; theyfelt for one so darkly fated, and so susceptible of every wound, thesame pitying and compliant indulgence the mother feels for a spoiled andsickly child--dreading to impose authority, even where they imagined itfor her benefit.  She availed herself of this license by refusing thecompanionship of the slave whom they wished to attend her. With theslender staff by which she guided her steps, she went now, as in herformer unprotected state, along the populous streets: it was almostmiraculous to perceive how quickly and how dexterously she threadedevery crowd, avoiding every danger, and could find her benighted waythrough the most intricate windings of the city.  But her chief delightwas still in visiting the few feet of ground which made the garden ofGlaucus--in tending the flowers that at least repaid her love.Sometimes she entered the chamber where he sat, and sought aconversation, which she nearly always broke off abruptly--forconversation with Glaucus only tended to one subject--Ione; and thatname from his lips inflicted agony upon her.  Often she bitterlyrepented the service she had rendered to Ione: often she said inly, \'Ifshe had fallen, Glaucus could have loved her no longer\'; and then darkand fearful thoughts crept into her breast.She had not experienced fully the trials that were in store for her,when she had been thus generous.  She had never before been present whenGlaucus and Ione were together; she had never heard that voice so kindto her, so much softer to another.  The shock that crushed her heartwith the tidings that Glaucus loved, had at first only saddened andbenumbed--by degrees jealousy took a wilder and fiercer shape; itpartook of hatred--it whispered revenge.  As you see the wind onlyagitate the green leaf upon the bough, while the leaf which has lainwithered and seared on the ground, bruised and trampled upon till thesap and life are gone, is suddenly whirled aloft--now here--nowthere--without stay and without rest; so the love which visits the happyand the hopeful hath but freshness on its wings! its violence is butsportive.  But the heart that hath fallen from the green things of life,that is without hope, that hath no summer in its fibres, is torn andwhirled by the same wind that but caresses its brethren--it hath nobough to cling to--it is dashed from path to path--till the winds fall,and it is crushed into the mire for ever.The friendless childhood of Nydia had hardened prematurely hercharacter; perhaps the heated scenes of profligacy through which she hadpassed, seemingly unscathed, had ripened her passions, though they hadnot sullied her purity.  The orgies of Burbo might only have disgusted,the banquets of the Egyptian might only have terrified, at the moment;but the winds that pass unheeded over the soil leave seeds behind them.As darkness, too, favors the imagination, so, perhaps, her veryblindness contributed to feed with wild and delirious visions the loveof the unfortunate girl.  The voice of Glaucus had been the first thathad sounded musically to her ear; his kindness made a deep impressionupon her mind; when he had left Pompeii in the former year, she hadtreasured up in her heart every word he had uttered; and when any onetold her that this friend and patron of the poor flower-girl was themost brilliant and the most graceful of the young revellers of Pompeii,she had felt a pleasing pride in nursing his recollection.  Even thetask which she imposed upon herself, of tending his flowers, served tokeep him in her mind; she associated him with all that was most charmingto her impressions; and when she had refused to express what image shefancied Ione to resemble, it was partly, perhaps, that whatever wasbright and soft in nature she had already combined with the thought ofGlaucus.  If any of my readers ever loved at an age which they would nowsmile to remember--an age in which fancy forestalled the reason, letthem say whether that love, among all its strange and complicateddelicacies, was not, above all other and later passions, susceptible ofjealousy? I seek not here the cause: I know that it is commonly thefact.When Glaucus returned to Pompeii, Nydia had told another year of life;that year, with its sorrows, its loneliness, its trials, had greatlydeveloped her mind and heart; and when the Athenian drew herunconsciously to his breast, deeming her still in soul as in years achild--when he kissed her smooth cheek, and wound his arm round hertrembling frame, Nydia felt suddenly, and as by revelation, that thosefeelings she had long and innocently cherished were of love.  Doomed tobe rescued from tyranny by Glaucus--doomed to take shelter under hisroof--doomed to breathe, but for so brief a time, the same air--anddoomed, in the first rush of a thousand happy, grateful, delicioussentiments of an overflowing heart, to hear that he loved another; to becommissioned to that other, the messenger, the minister; to feel all atonce that utter nothingness which she was--which she ever must be, butwhich, till then, her young mind had not taught her--that utternothingness to him who was all to her; what wonder that, in her wild andpassionate soul, all the elements jarred discordant; that if lovereigned over the whole, it was not the love which is born of the moresacred and soft emotions?  Sometimes she dreaded only lest Glaucusshould discover her secret; sometimes she felt indignant that it was notsuspected: it was a sign of contempt--could he imagine that she presumedso far?  Her feelings to Ione ebbed and flowed with every hour; now sheloved her because he did; now she hated him for the same cause.  Therewere moments when she could have murdered her unconscious mistress;moments when she could have laid down life for her.  These fierce andtremulous alternations of passion were too severe to be borne long.  Herhealth gave way, though she felt it not--her cheek paled--her step grewfeebler--tears came to her eyes more often, and relieved her less.One morning, when she repaired to her usual task in the garden of theAthenian, she found Glaucus under the columns of the peristyle, with amerchant of the town; he was selecting jewels for his destined bride.He had already fitted up her apartment; the jewels he bought that daywere placed also within it--they were never fated to grace the fair formof Ione; they may be seen at this day among the disinterred treasures ofPompeii, in the chambers of the studio at Naples.\'Come hither, Nydia; put down thy vase, and come hither.  Thou must takethis chain from me--stay--there, I have put it on.  There, Servilius,does it not become her?\'\'Wonderfully!\' answered the jeweller; for jewellers were well-bred andflattering men, even at that day.  \'But when these ear-rings glitter inthe ears of the noble Ione, then, by Bacchus! you will see whether myart adds anything to beauty.\'\'Ione?\' repeated Nydia, who had hitherto acknowledged by smiles andblushes the gift of Glaucus.\'Yes,\' replied the Athenian, carelessly toying with the gems; \'I amchoosing a present for Ione, but there are none worthy of her.\'He was startled as he spoke by an abrupt gesture of Nydia; she tore thechain violently from her neck, and dashed it on the ground.\'How is this?  What, Nydia, dost thou not like the bauble? art thouoffended?\'\'You treat me ever as a slave and as a child,\' replied the Thessalian,with ill-suppressed sobs, and she turned hastily away to the oppositecorner of the garden.Glaucus did not attempt to follow, or to soothe; he was offended; hecontinued to examine the jewels and to comment on their fashion--toobject to this and to praise that, and finally to be talked by themerchant into buying all; the safest plan for a lover, and a plan thatany one will do right to adopt, provided always that he can obtain anIone!When he had completed his purchase and dismissed the jeweller, heretired into his chamber, dressed, mounted his chariot, and went toIone.  He thought no more of the blind girl, or her offence; he hadforgotten both the one and the other.He spent the forenoon with his beautiful Neapolitan, repaired thence tothe baths, supped (if, as we have said before, we can justly sotranslate the three o\'clock coena of the Romans) alone, and abroad, forPompeii had its restaurateurs--and returning home to change his dressere he again repaired to the house of Ione, he passed the peristyle, butwith the absorbed reverie and absent eyes of a man in love, and did notnote the form of the poor blind girl, bending exactly in the same placewhere he had left her.  But though he saw her not, her ear recognized atonce the sound of his step. She had been counting the moments to hisreturn.  He had scarcely entered his favorite chamber, which opened onthe peristyle, and seated himself musingly on his couch, when he felthis robe timorously touched, and, turning, he beheld Nydia kneelingbefore him, and holding up to him a handful of flowers--a gentle andappropriate peace-offering--her eyes, darkly upheld to his own, streamedwith tears.\'I have offended thee,\' said she, sobbing, \'and for the first time.  Iwould die rather than cause thee a moment\'s pain--say that thou wiltforgive me. See! I have taken up the chain; I have put it on: I willnever part from it--it is thy gift.\'\'My dear Nydia,\' returned Glaucus, and raising her, he kissed herforehead, \'think of it no more!  But why, my child, wert thou sosuddenly angry?  I could not divine the cause?\'\'Do not ask!\' said she, coloring violently.  \'I am a thing full offaults and humors; you know I am but a child--you say so often: is itfrom a child that you can expect a reason for every folly?\'\'But, prettiest, you will soon be a child no more; and if you would haveus treat you as a woman, you must learn to govern these singularimpulses and gales of passion.  Think not I chide: no, it is for yourhappiness only I speak.\'\'It is true,\' said Nydia, \'I must learn to govern myself I must bide, Imust suppress, my heart.  This is a woman\'s task and duty; methinks hervirtue is hypocrisy.\'\'Self-control is not deceit, my Nydia,\' returned the Athenian; \'and thatis the virtue necessary alike to man and to woman; it is the truesenatorial toga, the badge of the dignity it covers!\'\'Self-control! self-control!  Well, well, what you say is right! When Ilisten to you, Glaucus, my wildest thoughts grow calm and sweet, and adelicious serenity falls over me.  Advise, ah! guide me ever, mypreserver!\'\'Thy affectionate heart will be thy best guide, Nydia, when thou hastlearned to regulate its feelings.\'\'Ah! that will be never,\' sighed Nydia, wiping away her tears.\'Say not so: the first effort is the only difficult one.\'\'I have made many first efforts,\' answered Nydia, innocently.  \'But you,my Mentor, do you find it so easy to control yourself?  Can you conceal,can you even regulate, your love for Ione?\'\'Love! dear Nydia: ah! that is quite another matter,\' answered the youngpreceptor.\'I thought so!\' returned Nydia, with a melancholy smile.  \'Glaucus, wiltthou take my poor flowers?  Do with them as thou wilt--thou canst givethem to Ione,\' added she, with a little hesitation.\'Nay, Nydia,\' answered Glaucus, kindly, divining something of jealousyin her language, though he imagined it only the jealousy of a vain andsusceptible child; \'I will not give thy pretty flowers to any one.  Sithere and weave them into a garland; I will wear it this night: it is notthe first those delicate fingers have woven for me.\'The poor girl delightedly sat down beside Glaucus.  She drew from hergirdle a ball of the many-colored threads, or rather slender ribands,used in the weaving of garlands, and which (for it was her professionaloccupation) she carried constantly with her, and began quickly andgracefully to commence her task.  Upon her young cheeks the tears werealready dried, a faint but happy smile played round her lips--childlike,indeed, she was sensible only of the joy of the present hour: she wasreconciled to Glaucus: he had forgiven her--she was beside him--heplayed caressingly with her silken hair--his breath fanned hercheek--Ione, the cruel Ione, was not by--none other demanded, divided,his care.  Yes, she was happy and forgetful; it was one of the fewmoments in her brief and troubled life that it was sweet to treasure, torecall. As the butterfly, allured by the winter sun, basks for a littlein the sudden light, ere yet the wind awakes and the frost comes on,which shall blast it before the eve--she rested beneath a beam, which,by contrast with the wonted skies, was not chilling; and the instinctwhich should have warned her of its briefness, bade her only gladden inits smile.\'Thou hast beautiful locks,\' said Glaucus.  \'They were once, I weenwell, a mother\'s delight.\'Nydia sighed; it would seem that she had not been born a slave; but sheever shunned the mention of her parentage, and, whether obscure ornoble, certain it is that her birth was never known by her benefactors,nor by any one in those distant shores, even to the last.  The child ofsorrow and of mystery, she came and went as some bird that enters ourchamber for a moment; we see it flutter for a while before us, we knownot whence it flew or to what region it escapes.Nydia sighed, and after a short pause, without answering the remark,said: \'But do I weave too many roses in my wreath, Glaucus?  They tellme it is thy favorite flower.\'\'And ever favored, my Nydia, be it by those who have the soul of poetry:it is the flower of love, of festival; it is also the flower we dedicateto silence and to death; it blooms on our brows in life, while life beworth the having; it is scattered above our sepulchre when we are nomore.\'\'Ah! would,\' said Nydia, \'instead of this perishable wreath, that Icould take thy web from the hand of the Fates, and insert the rosesthere!\'\'Pretty one! thy wish is worthy of a voice so attuned to song; it isuttered in the spirit of song; and, whatever my doom, I thank thee.\'\'Whatever thy doom! is it not already destined to all things bright andfair?  My wish was vain.  The Fates will be as tender to thee as Ishould.\'\'It might not be so, Nydia, were it not for love!  While youth lasts, Imay forget my country for a while.  But what Athenian, in his gravermanhood, can think of Athens as she was, and be contented that he ishappy, while she is fallen?--fallen, and for ever?\'\'And why for ever?\'\'As ashes cannot be rekindled--as love once dead can never revive, sofreedom departed from a people is never regained.  But talk we not ofthese matters unsuited to thee.\'\'To me, oh! thou errest.  I, too, have my sighs for Greece; my cradlewas rocked at the foot of Olympus; the gods have left the mountain, buttheir traces may be seen--seen in the hearts of their worshippers, seenin the beauty of their clime: they tell me it is beautiful, and I havefelt its airs, to which even these are harsh--its sun, to which theseskies are chill.  Oh! talk to me of Greece! Poor fool that I am, I cancomprehend thee! and methinks, had I yet lingered on those shores, had Ibeen a Grecian maid whose happy fate it was to love and to be loved, Imyself could have armed my lover for another Marathon, a new Plataea.Yes, the hand that now weaves the roses should have woven thee the olivecrown!\'\'If such a day could come!\' said Glaucus, catching the enthusiasm of theblind Thessalian, and half rising.--\'But no! the sun has set, and thenight only bids us be forgetful--and in forgetfulness be gay--weavestill the roses!\'But it was with a melancholy tone of forced gaiety that the Athenianuttered the last words: and sinking into a gloomy reverie, he was onlywakened from it, a few minutes afterwards, by the voice of Nydia, as shesang in a low tone the following words, which he had once taught her:--           THE APOLOGY FOR PLEASURE                    I           Who will assume the bays              That the hero wore?           Wreaths on the Tomb of Days              Gone evermore!           Who shall disturb the brave,           Or one leaf on their holy grave?           The laurel is vowed to them,           Leave the bay on its sacred stem!              But this, the rose, the fading rose,              Alike for slave and freeman grows.                    II           If Memory sit beside the dead              With tombs her only treasure;           If Hope is lost and Freedom fled,              The more excuse for Pleasure.           Come, weave the wreath, the roses weave,              The rose at least is ours:           To feeble hearts our fathers leave,              In pitying scorn, the flowers!                    III             On the summit, worn and hoary,           Of Phyle\'s solemn hill,           The tramp of the brave is still!           And still in the saddening Mart,           The pulse of that mighty heart,              Whose very blood was glory!           Glaucopis forsakes her own,              The angry gods forget us;           But yet, the blue streams along,           Walk the feet of the silver Song;           And the night-bird wakes the moon;           And the bees in the blushing noon              Haunt the heart of the old Hymettus.           We are fallen, but not forlorn,              If something is left to cherish;           As Love was the earliest born,              So Love is the last to perish.                    IV           Wreathe then the roses, wreathe              The BEAUTIFUL still is ours,           While the stream shall flow and the sky shall glow,           The BEAUTIFUL still is ours!           Whatever is fair, or soft, or bright,           In the lap of day or the arms of night,           Whispers our soul of Greece--of Greece,           And hushes our care with a voice of peace.              Wreathe then the roses, wreathe!              They tell me of earlier hours;           And I hear the heart of my Country breathe              From the lips of the Stranger\'s flowers.Chapter VNYDIA ENCOUNTERS JULIA.  INTERVIEW OF THE HEATHEN SISTER AND CONVERTEDBROTHER.  AN ATHENIAN\'S NOTION OF CHRISTIANITY.\'WHAT happiness to Ione! what bliss to be ever by the side of Glaucus,to hear his voice!--And she too can see him!\'Such was the soliloquy of the blind girl, as she walked alone and attwilight to the house of her new mistress, whither Glaucus had alreadypreceded her.  Suddenly she was interrupted in her fond thoughts by afemale voice.\'Blind flower-girl, whither goest thou?  There is no pannier under thinearm; hast thou sold all thy flowers?\'The person thus accosting Nydia was a lady of a handsome but a bold andunmaidenly countenance: it was Julia, the daughter of Diomed. Her veilwas half raised as she spoke; she was accompanied by Diomed himself, andby a slave carrying a lantern before them--the merchant and his daughterwere returning home from a supper at one of their neighbors\'.\'Dost thou not remember my voice?\' continued Julia.  \'I am the daughterof Diomed the wealthy.\'\'Ah! forgive me; yes, I recall the tones of your voice.  No, nobleJulia, I have no flowers to sell.\'\'I heard that thou wert purchased by the beautiful Greek Glaucus; isthat true, pretty slave?\' asked Julia.\'I serve the Neapolitan, Ione,\' replied Nydia, evasively.\'Ah! and it is true, then...\'\'Come, come!\' interrupted Diomed, with his cloak up to his mouth, \'thenight grows cold; I cannot stay here while you prate to that blind girl:come, let her follow you home, if you wish to speak to her.\'\'Do, child,\' said Julia, with the air of one not accustomed to berefused; \'I have much to ask of thee: come.\'\'I cannot this night, it grows late,\' answered Nydia.  \'I must be athome; I am not free, noble Julia.\'\'What, the meek Ione will chide thee?--Ay, I doubt not she is a secondThalestris.  But come, then, to-morrow: do--remember I have been thyfriend of old.\'\'I will obey thy wishes,\' answered Nydia; and Diomed again impatientlysummoned his daughter: she was obliged to proceed, with the mainquestion she had desired to put to Nydia unasked.Meanwhile we return to Ione.  The interval of time that had elapsed thatday between the first and second visit of Glaucus had not been too gailyspent: she had received a visit from her brother.  Since the night hehad assisted in saving her from the Egyptian, she had not before seenhim.Occupied with his own thoughts--thoughts of so serious and intense anature--the young priest had thought little of his sister; in truth,men, perhaps of that fervent order of mind which is ever aspiring aboveearth, are but little prone to the earthlier affections; and it had beenlong since Apaecides had sought those soft and friendly interchanges ofthought, those sweet confidences, which in his earlier youth had boundhim to Ione, and which are so natural to that endearing connection whichexisted between them.Ione, however, had not ceased to regret his estrangement: she attributedit, at present, to the engrossing duties of his severe fraternity.  Andoften, amidst all her bright hopes, and her new attachment to herbetrothed--often, when she thought of her brother\'s brow prematurelyfurrowed, his unsmiling lip, and bended frame, she sighed to think thatthe service of the gods could throw so deep a shadow over that earthwhich the gods created.But this day when he visited her there was a strange calmness on hisfeatures, a more quiet and self-possessed expression in his sunken eyes,than she had marked for years.  This apparent improvement was butmomentary--it was a false calm, which the least breeze could ruffle.\'May the gods bless thee, my brother!\' said she, embracing him.\'The gods!  Speak not thus vaguely; perchance there is but one God!\'\'My brother!\'\'What if the sublime faith of the Nazarene be true?  What if God be amonarch--One--Invisible--Alone?  What if these numerous, countlessdeities, whose altars fill the earth, be but evil demons, seeking towean us from the true creed?  This may be the case, Ione!\'\'Alas! can we believe it? or if we believed, would it not be amelancholy faith,\' answered the Neapolitan.  \'What! all this beautifulworld made only human!--mountain disenchanted of its Oread--the watersof their Nymph--that beautiful prodigality of faith, which makeseverything divine, consecrating the meanest flowers, bearing celestialwhispers in the faintest breeze--wouldst thou deny this, and make theearth mere dust and clay?  No, Apaecides: all that is brightest in ourhearts is that very credulity which peoples the universe with gods.\'Ione answered as a believer in the poesy of the old mythology wouldanswer. We may judge by that reply how obstinate and hard the contestwhich Christianity had to endure among the heathens.  The GracefulSuperstition was never silent; every, the most household, action oftheir lives was entwined with it--it was a portion of life itself, asthe flowers are a part of the thyrsus.  At every incident they recurredto a god, every cup of wine was prefaced by a libation; the verygarlands on their thresholds were dedicated to some divinity; theirancestors themselves, made holy, presided as Lares over their hearth andhall.  So abundant was belief with them, that in their own climes, atthis hour, idolatry has never thoroughly been outrooted: it changes butits objects of worship; it appeals to innumerable saints where once itresorted to divinities; and it pours its crowds, in listening reverence,to oracles at the shrines of St. Januarius or St. Stephen, instead of tothose of Isis or Apollo.But these superstitions were not to the early Christians the object ofcontempt so much as of horror.  They did not believe, with the quietscepticism of the heathen philosopher, that the gods were inventions ofthe priests; nor even, with the vulgar, that, according to the dim lightof history, they had been mortals like themselves.  They imagined theheathen divinities to be evil spirits--they transplanted to Italy and toGreece the gloomy demons of India and the East; and in Jupiter or inMars they shuddered at the representative of Moloch or of Satan.Apaecides had not yet adopted formally the Christian faith, but he wasalready on the brink of it.  He already participated the doctrines ofOlinthus--he already imagined that the lively imaginations of theheathen were the suggestions of the arch-enemy of mankind.  The innocentand natural answer of Ione made him shudder.  He hastened to replyvehemently, and yet so confusedly, that Ione feared for his reason morethan she dreaded his violence.\'Ah, my brother!\' said she, \'these hard duties of thine have shatteredthy very sense.  Come to me, Apaecides, my brother, my own brother; giveme thy hand, let me wipe the dew from thy brow--chide me not now, Iunderstand thee not; think only that Ione could not offend thee!\'\'Ione,\' said Apaecides, drawing her towards him, and regarding hertenderly, \'can I think that this beautiful form, this kind heart, may bedestined to an eternity of torment?\'\'Dii meliora! the gods forbid!\' said Ione, in the customary form ofwords by which her contemporaries thought an omen might be averted.The words, and still more the superstition they implied, wounded the earof Apaecides.  He rose, muttering to himself, turned from the chamber,then, stopping, half way, gazed wistfully on Ione, and extended hisarms.Ione flew to them in joy; he kissed her earnestly, and then he said:\'Farewell, my sister! when we next meet, thou mayst be to me as nothing;take thou, then, this embrace--full yet of all the tender reminiscencesof childhood, when faith and hope, creeds, customs, interests, objects,were the same to us.  Now, the tie is to be broken!\'With these strange words he left the house.The great and severest trial of the primitive Christians was indeedthis; their conversion separated them from their dearest bonds. Theycould not associate with beings whose commonest actions, whose commonestforms of speech, were impregnated with idolatry.  They shuddered at theblessing of love, to their ears it was uttered in a demon\'s name.  This,their misfortune, was their strength; if it divided them from the restof the world, it was to unite them proportionally to each other.  Theywere men of iron who wrought forth the Word of God, and verily the bondsthat bound them were of iron also!Glaucus found Ione in tears; he had already assumed the sweet privilegeto console.  He drew from her a recital of her interview with herbrother; but in her confused account of language, itself so confused toone not prepared for it, he was equally at a loss with Ione to conceivethe intentions or the meaning of Apaecides.\'Hast thou ever heard much,\' asked she, \'of this new sect of theNazarenes, of which my brother spoke?\'\'I have often heard enough of the votaries,\' returned Glaucus, \'but oftheir exact tenets know I naught, save that in their doctrine thereseemeth something preternaturally chilling and morose.  They live apartfrom their kind; they affect to be shocked even at our simple uses ofgarlands; they have no sympathies with the cheerful amusements of life;they utter awful threats of the coming destruction of the world; theyappear, in one word, to have brought their unsmiling and gloomy creedout of the cave of Trophonius. Yet,\' continued Glaucus, after a slightpause, \'they have not wanted men of great power and genius, norconverts, even among the Areopagites of Athens. Well do I remember tohave heard my father speak of one strange guest at Athens, many yearsago; methinks his name was PAUL.  My father was amongst a mighty crowdthat gathered on one of our immemorial hills to hear this sage of theEast expound: through the wide throng there rang not a singlemurmur!--the jest and the roar, with which our native orators arereceived, were hushed for him--and when on the loftiest summit of thathill, raised above the breathless crowd below, stood this mysteriousvisitor, his mien and his countenance awed every heart, even before asound left his lips.  He was a man, I have heard my father say, of notall stature, but of noble and impressive mien; his robes were dark andample; the declining sun, for it was evening, shone aslant upon his formas it rose aloft, motionless, and commanding; his countenance was muchworn and marked, as of one who had braved alike misfortune and thesternest vicissitude of many climes; but his eyes were bright with analmost unearthly fire; and when he raised his arm to speak, it was withthe majesty of a man into whom the Spirit of a God hath rushed!\'""Men of Athens!"" he is reported to have said, ""I find amongst ye analtar with this inscription:              TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.  Ye worship in ignorance the same Deity I serve.    To you unknown till now, to you be it now revealed.""\'Then declared that solemn man how this great Maker of all things, whohad appointed unto man his several tribes and his various homes--theLord of earth and the universal heaven, dwelt not in temples made withhands; that His presence, His spirit, were in the air we breathed--ourlife and our being were with Him.  ""Think you,"" he cried, ""that theInvisible is like your statues of gold and marble?  Think you that Heneedeth sacrifice from you: He who made heaven and earth?"" Then spoke heof fearful and coming times, of the end of the world, of a second risingof the dead, whereof an assurance had been given to man in theresurrection of the mighty Being whose religion he came to preach.\'When he thus spoke, the long-pent murmur went forth, and thephilosophers that were mingled with the people, muttered their sagecontempt; there might you have seen the chilling frown of the Stoic, andthe Cynic\'s sneer; and the Epicurean, who believeth not even in our ownElysium, muttered a pleasant jest, and swept laughing through the crowd:but the deep heart of the people was touched and thrilled; and theytrembled, though they knew not why, for verily the stranger had thevoice and majesty of a man to whom ""The Unknown God"" had committed thepreaching of His faith.\'Ione listened with wrapt attention, and the serious and earnest mannerof the narrator betrayed the impression that he himself had receivedfrom one who had been amongst the audience that on the hill of theheathen Mars had heard the first tidings of the word of Christ!Chapter VITHE PORTER.  THE GIRL.  AND THE GLADIATOR.THE door of Diomed\'s house stood open, and Medon, the old slave, sat atthe bottom of the steps by which you ascended to the mansion. Thatluxurious mansion of the rich merchant of Pompeii is still to be seenjust without the gates of the city, at the commencement of the Street ofTombs; it was a gay neighborhood, despite the dead.  On the oppositeside, but at some yards nearer the gate, was a spacious hostelry, atwhich those brought by business or by pleasure to Pompeii often stoppedto refresh themselves.  In the space before the entrance of the inn nowstood wagons, and carts, and chariots, some just arrived, some justquitting, in all the bustle of an animated and popular resort of publicentertainment.  Before the door, some farmers, seated on a bench by asmall circular table, were talking over their morning cups, on theaffairs of their calling.  On the side of the door itself was paintedgaily and freshly the eternal sign of the chequers. By the roof of theinn stretched a terrace, on which some females, wives of the farmersabove mentioned, were, some seated, some leaning over the railing, andconversing with their friends below. In a deep recess, at a littledistance, was a covered seat, in which some two or three poorertravellers were resting themselves, and shaking the dust from theirgarments.  On the other side stretched a wide space, originally theburial-ground of a more ancient race than the present denizens ofPompeii, and now converted into the Ustrinum, or place for the burningof the dead.  Above this rose the terraces of a gay villa, half hid bytrees.  The tombs themselves, with their graceful and varied shapes, theflowers and the foliage that surrounded them, made no melancholy featurein the prospect.  Hard by the gate of the city, in a small niche, stoodthe still form of the well-disciplined Roman sentry, the sun shiningbrightly on his polished crest, and the lance on which he leaned.  Thegate itself was divided into three arches, the centre one for vehicles,the others for the foot-passengers; and on either side rose the massivewalls which girt the city, composed, patched, repaired at a thousanddifferent epochs, according as war, time, or the earthquake hadshattered that vain protection.  At frequent intervals rose squaretowers, whose summits broke in picturesque rudeness the regular line ofthe wall, and contrasted well with the modern buildings gleaming whitelyby.The curving road, which in that direction leads from Pompeii toHerculaneum, wound out of sight amidst hanging vines, above whichfrowned the sullen majesty of Vesuvius.\'Hast thou heard the news, old Medon?\' said a young woman, with apitcher in her hand, as she paused by Diomed\'s door to gossip a momentwith the slave, ere she repaired to the neighboring inn to fill thevessel, and coquet with the travellers.\'The news! what news?\' said the slave, raising his eyes moodily from theground.\'Why, there passed through the gate this morning, no doubt ere thou wertwell awake, such a visitor to Pompeii!\'\'Ay,\' said the slave, indifferently.\'Yes, a present from the noble Pomponianus.\'\'A present!  I thought thou saidst a visitor?\'\'It is both visitor and present.  Know, O dull and stupid! that it is amost beautiful young tiger, for our approaching games in theamphitheatre.  Hear you that, Medon?  Oh, what pleasure!  I declare Ishall not sleep a wink till I see it; they say it has such a roar!\'\'Poor fool!\' said Medon, sadly and cynically.\'Fool me no fool, old churl!  It is a pretty thing, a tiger, especiallyif we could but find somebody for him to eat.  We have now a lion and atiger; only consider that, Medon! and for want of two good criminalsperhaps we shall be forced to see them eat each other.  By-the-by, yourson is a gladiator, a handsome man and a strong, can you not persuadehim to fight the tiger?  Do now, you would oblige me mightily; nay, youwould be a benefactor to the whole town.\'\'Vah! vah!\' said the slave, with great asperity; \'think of thine owndanger ere thou thus pratest of my poor boy\'s death.\'\'My own danger!\' said the girl, frightened and looking hastilyaround--\'Avert the omen! let thy words fall on thine own head!\' And thegirl, as she spoke, touched a talisman suspended round her neck. \'""Thineown danger!"" what danger threatens me?\'\'Had the earthquake but a few nights since no warning?\' said Medon.\'Has it not a voice?  Did it not say to us all, ""Prepare for death; theend of all things is at hand?""\'\'Bah, stuff!\' said the young woman, settling the folds of her tunic.\'Now thou talkest as they say the Nazarenes talked--methinks thou artone of them.  Well, I can prate with thee, grey croaker, no more: thougrowest worse and worse--Vale! O Hercules, send us a man for thelion--and another for the tiger!\'            Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show,            With a forest of faces in every row!            Lo, the swordsmen, bold as the son of Alcmena,            Sweep, side by side, o\'er the hushed arena;            Talk while you may--you will hold your breath            When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death.            Tramp, tramp, how gaily they go!            Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show!Chanting in a silver and clear voice this feminine ditty, and holding upher tunic from the dusty road, the young woman stepped lightly across tothe crowded hostelry.\'My poor son!\' said the slave, half aloud, \'is it for things like thisthou art to be butchered?  Oh! faith of Christ, I could worship thee inall sincerity, were it but for the horror which thou inspirest for thesebloody lists.\'The old man\'s head sank dejectedly on his breast.  He remained silentand absorbed, but every now and then with the corner of his sleeve hewiped his eyes.  His heart was with his son; he did not see the figurethat now approached from the gate with a quick step, and a somewhatfierce and reckless gait and carriage.  He did not lift his eyes tillthe figure paused opposite the place where he sat, and with a soft voiceaddressed him by the name of:\'Father!\'\'My boy! my Lydon! is it indeed thou?\' said the old man, joyfully. \'Ah,thou wert present to my thoughts.\'\'I am glad to hear it, my father,\' said the gladiator, respectfullytouching the knees and beard of the slave; \'and soon may I be alwayspresent with thee, not in thought only.\'\'Yes, my son--but not in this world,\' replied the slave, mournfully.\'Talk not thus, O my sire! look cheerfully, for I feel so--I am surethat I shall win the day; and then, the gold I gain buys thy freedom.Oh! my father, it was but a few days since that I was taunted, by one,too, whom I would gladly have undeceived, for he is more generous thanthe rest of his equals.  He is not Roman--he is of Athens--by him I wastaunted with the lust of gain--when I demanded what sum was the prize ofvictory.  Alas! he little knew the soul of Lydon!\'\'My boy! my boy!\' said the old slave, as, slowly ascending the steps, heconducted his son to his own little chamber, communicating with theentrance hall (which in this villa was the peristyle, not theatrium)--you may see it now; it is the third door to the right onentering.  (The first door conducts to the staircase; the second is buta false recess, in which there stood a statue of bronze.) \'Generous,affectionate, pious as are thy motives,\' said Medon, when they were thussecured from observation, \'thy deed itself is guilt: thou art to riskthy blood for thy father\'s freedom--that might be forgiven; but theprize of victory is the blood of another.  Oh, that is a deadly sin; noobject can purify it.  Forbear! forbear! rather would I be a slave forever than purchase liberty on such terms!\'\'Hush, my father!\' replied Lydon, somewhat impatiently; \'thou hastpicked up in this new creed of thine, of which I pray thee not to speakto me, for the gods that gave me strength denied me wisdom, and Iunderstand not one word of what thou often preachest to me--thou hastpicked up, I say, in this new creed, some singular fantasies of rightand wrong.  Pardon me if I offend thee: but reflect!  Against whom shallI contend?  Oh! couldst thou know those wretches with whom, for thysake, I assort, thou wouldst think I purified earth by removing one ofthem.  Beasts, whose very lips drop blood; things, all savage,unprincipled in their very courage: ferocious, heartless, senseless; notie of life can bind them: they know not fear, it is true--but neitherknow they gratitude, nor charity, nor love; they are made but for theirown career, to slaughter without pity, to die without dread!  Can thygods, whosoever they be, look with wrath on a conflict with such asthese, and in such a cause?  Oh, My father, wherever the powers abovegaze down on earth, they behold no duty so sacred, so sanctifying, asthe sacrifice offered to an aged parent by the piety of a grateful son!\'The poor old slave, himself deprived of the lights of knowledge, andonly late a convert to the Christian faith, knew not with what argumentsto enlighten an ignorance at once so dark, and yet so beautiful in itserror. His first impulse was to throw himself on his son\'s breast--hisnext to start away to wring his hands; and in the attempt to reprove,his broken voice lost itself in weeping.\'And if,\' resumed Lydon--\'if thy Deity (methinks thou wilt own but one?)be indeed that benevolent and pitying Power which thou assertest Him tobe, He will know also that thy very faith in Him first confirmed me inthat determination thou blamest.\'\'How! what mean you?\' said the slave.\'Why, thou knowest that I, sold in my childhood as a slave, was set freeat Rome by the will of my master, whom I had been fortunate enough toplease. I hastened to Pompeii to see thee--I found thee already aged andinfirm, under the yoke of a capricious and pampered lord--thou hadstlately adopted this new faith, and its adoption made thy slavery doublypainful to thee; it took away all the softening charm of custom, whichreconciles us so often to the worst.  Didst thou not complain to me thatthou wert compelled to offices that were not odious to thee as a slave,but guilty as a Nazarene? Didst thou not tell me that thy soul shookwith remorse when thou wert compelled to place even a crumb of cakebefore the Lares that watch over yon impluvium? that thy soul was tornby a perpetual struggle?  Didst thou not tell me that even by pouringwine before the threshold, and calling on the name of some Greciandeity, thou didst fear thou wert incurring penalties worse than those ofTantalus, an eternity of tortures more terrible than those of theTartarian fields?  Didst thou not tell me this?  I wondered, I could notcomprehend; nor, by Hercules! can I now: but I was thy son, and my soletask was to compassionate and relieve.  Could I hear thy groans, could Iwitness thy mysterious horrors, thy constant anguish, and remaininactive? No! by the immortal gods! the thought struck me like lightfrom Olympus!  I had no money, but I had strength and youth--these werethy gifts--I could sell these in my turn for thee!  I learned the amountof thy ransom--I learned that the usual prize of a victorious gladiatorwould doubly pay it. I became a gladiator--I linked myself with thoseaccursed men, scorning, loathing, while I joined--I acquired theirskill--blessed be the lesson!--it shall teach me to free my father!\'\'Oh, that thou couldst hear Olinthus!\' sighed the old man, more and moreaffected by the virtue of his son, but not less strongly convinced ofthe criminality of his purpose.\'I will hear the whole world talk if thou wilt,\' answered the gladiator,gaily; \'but not till thou art a slave no more.  Beneath thy own roof, myfather, thou shalt puzzle this dull brain all day long, ay, and allnight too, if it give thee pleasure.  Oh, such a spot as I have chalkedout for thee!--it is one of the nine hundred and ninety-nine shops ofold Julia Felix, in the sunny part of the city, where thou mayst baskbefore the door in the day--and I will sell the oil and the wine forthee, my father--and then, please Venus (or if it does not please her,since thou lovest not her name, it is all one to Lydon)--then, I say,perhaps thou mayst have a daughter, too, to tend thy grey hairs, andhear shrill voices at thy knee, that shall call thee ""Lydon\'s father!""Ah! we shall be so happy--the prize can purchase all.  Cheer thee! cheerup, my sire!--And now I must away--day wears--the lanista waits me.Come! thy blessing!\'As Lydon thus spoke, he had already quitted the dark chamber of hisfather; and speaking eagerly, though in a whispered tone, they now stoodat the same place in which we introduced the porter at his post.\'O bless thee! bless thee, my brave boy!\' said Medon, fervently; \'andmay the great Power that reads all hearts see the nobleness of thine,and forgive its error!\'The tall shape of the gladiator passed swiftly down the path; the eyesof the slave followed its light but stately steps, till the last glimpsewas gone; and then, sinking once more on his seat, his eyes againfastened themselves on the ground.  His form, mute and unmoving, as athing of stone. His heart!--who, in our happier age, can even imagineits struggles--its commotion?\'May I enter?\' said a sweet voice.  \'Is thy mistress Julia within?\'The slave mechanically motioned to the visitor to enter, but she whoaddressed him could not see the gesture--she repeated her questiontimidly, but in a louder voice.\'Have I not told thee!\' said the slave, peevishly: \'enter.\'\'Thanks,\' said the speaker, plaintively; and the slave, roused by thetone, looked up, and recognized the blind flower-girl.  Sorrow cansympathize with affliction--he raised himself, and guided her steps tothe head of the adjacent staircase (by which you descended to Julia\'sapartment), where, summoning a female slave, he consigned to her thecharge of the blind girl.Chapter VIITHE DRESSING-ROOM OF A POMPEIAN BEAUTY. IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BETWEENJULIA AND NYDIA.THE elegant Julia sat in her chamber, with her slaves around her--likethe cubiculum which adjoined it, the room was small, but much largerthan the usual apartments appropriated to sleep, which were sodiminutive, that few who have not seen the bed-chambers, even in thegayest mansions, can form any notion of the petty pigeon-holes in whichthe citizens of Pompeii evidently thought it desirable to pass thenight.  But, in fact, \'bed\' with the ancients was not that grave,serious, and important part of domestic mysteries which it is with us.The couch itself was more like a very narrow and small sofa, lightenough to be transported easily, and by the occupant himself, from placeto place; and it was, no doubt, constantly shifted from chamber tochamber, according to the caprice of the inmate, or the changes of theseason; for that side of the house which was crowded in one month,might, perhaps, be carefully avoided in the next.  There was also amongthe Italians of that period a singular and fastidious apprehension oftoo much daylight; their darkened chambers, which first appear to us theresult of a negligent architecture, were the effect of the mostelaborate study. In their porticoes and gardens they courted the sunwhenever it so pleased their luxurious tastes.  In the interior of theirhouses they sought rather the coolness and the shade.Julia\'s apartment at that season was in the lower part of the house,immediately beneath the state rooms above, and looking upon the garden,with which it was on a level.  The wide door, which was glazed, aloneadmitted the morning rays: yet her eye, accustomed to a certaindarkness, was sufficiently acute to perceive exactly what colors werethe most becoming--what shade of the delicate rouge gave the brightestbeam to her dark glance, and the most youthful freshness to her cheek.On the table, before which she sat, was a small and circular mirror ofthe most polished steel: round which, in precise order, were ranged thecosmetics and the unguents--the perfumes and the paints--the jewels andcombs--the ribands and the gold pins, which were destined to add to thenatural attractions of beauty the assistance of art and the capriciousallurements of fashion.  Through the dimness of the room glowed brightlythe vivid and various colourings of the wall, in all the dazzlingfrescoes of Pompeian taste.  Before the dressing-table, and under thefeet of Julia, was spread a carpet, woven from the looms of the East.Near at hand, on another table, was a silver basin and ewer; anextinguished lamp, of most exquisite workmanship, in which the artisthad represented a Cupid reposing under the spreading branches of amyrtle-tree; and a small roll of papyrus, containing the softest elegiesof Tibullus.  Before the door, which communicated with the cubiculum,hung a curtain richly broidered with gold flowers.  Such was thedressing-room of a beauty eighteen centuries ago.The fair Julia leaned indolently back on her seat, while the ornatrix(i.e. hairdresser) slowly piled, one above the other, a mass of smallcurls, dexterously weaving the false with the true, and carrying thewhole fabric to a height that seemed to place the head rather at thecentre than the summit of the human form.Her tunic, of a deep amber, which well set off her dark hair andsomewhat embrowned complexion, swept in ample folds to her feet, whichwere cased in slippers, fastened round the slender ankle by whitethongs; while a profusion of pearls were embroidered in the slipperitself, which was of purple, and turned slightly upward, as do theTurkish slippers at this day. An old slave, skilled by long experiencein all the arcana of the toilet, stood beside the hairdresser, with thebroad and studded girdle of her mistress over her arm, and giving, fromtime to time (mingled with judicious flattery to the lady herself),instructions to the mason of the ascending pile.\'Put that pin rather more to the right--lower--stupid one!  Do you notobserve how even those beautiful eyebrows are?--One would think you weredressing Corinna, whose face is all of one side.  Now put in theflowers--what, fool!--not that dull pink--you are not suiting colors tothe dim cheek of Chloris: it must be the brightest flowers that canalone suit the cheek of the young Julia.\'\'Gently!\' said the lady, stamping her small foot violently: \'you pull myhair as if you were plucking up a weed!\'\'Dull thing!\' continued the directress of the ceremony.  \'Do you notknow how delicate is your mistress?--you are not dressing the coarsehorsehair of the widow Fulvia.  Now, then, the riband--that\'s right.Fair Julia, look in the mirror; saw you ever anything so lovely asyourself?\'When, after innumerable comments, difficulties, and delays, theintricate tower was at length completed, the next preparation was thatof giving to the eyes the soft languish, produced by a dark powderapplied to the lids and brows; a small patch cut in the form of acrescent, skillfully placed by the rosy lips, attracted attention totheir dimples, and to the teeth, to which already every art had beenapplied in order to heighten the dazzle of their natural whiteness.To another slave, hitherto idle, was now consigned the charge ofarranging the jewels--the ear-rings of pearl (two to each ear)--themassive bracelets of gold--the chain formed of rings of the same metal,to which a talisman cut in crystals was attached--the graceful buckle onthe left shoulder, in which was set an exquisite cameo of Psyche--thegirdle of purple riband, richly wrought with threads of gold, andclasped by interlacing serpents--and lastly, the various rings, fittedto every joint of the white and slender fingers.  The toilet was nowarranged according to the last mode of Rome.  The fair Julia regardedherself with a last gaze of complacent vanity, and reclining again uponher seat, she bade the youngest of her slaves, in a listless tone, readto her the enamoured couplets of Tibullus. This lecture was stillproceeding, when a female slave admitted Nydia into the presence of thelady of the place.\'Salve, Julia!\' said the flower-girl, arresting her steps within a fewpaces from the spot where Julia sat, and crossing her arms upon herbreast.  \'I have obeyed your commands.\'\'You have done well, flower-girl,\' answered the lady.  \'Approach--youmay take a seat.\'One of the slaves placed a stool by Julia, and Nydia seated herself.Julia looked hard at the Thessalian for some moments in rather anembarrassed silence.  She then motioned her attendants to withdraw, andto close the door.  When they were alone, she said, looking mechanicallyfrom Nydia, and forgetful that she was with one who could not observeher countenance:\'You serve the Neapolitan, Ione?\'\'I am with her at present,\' answered Nydia.\'Is she as handsome as they say?\'\'I know not,\' replied Nydia.  \'How can I judge?\'\'Ah! I should have remembered.  But thou hast ears, if not eyes.  Do thyfellow-slaves tell thee she is handsome?  Slaves talking with oneanother forget to flatter even their mistress.\'\'They tell me that she is beautiful.\'\'Hem!--say they that she is tall?\'\'Yes.\'\'Why, so am I.  Dark haired?\'\'I have heard so.\'\'So am I.  And doth Glaucus visit her much?\'\'Daily\' returned Nydia, with a half-suppressed sigh.\'Daily, indeed!  Does he find her handsome?\'\'I should think so, since they are so soon to be wedded.\'\'Wedded!\' cried Julia, turning pale even through the false roses on hercheek, and starting from her couch.  Nydia did not, of course, perceivethe emotion she had caused.  Julia remained a long time silent; but herheaving breast and flashing eyes would have betrayed, to one who couldhave seen, the wound her vanity had sustained.\'They tell me thou art a Thessalian,\' said she, at last breakingsilence.\'And truly!\'\'Thessaly is the land of magic and of witches, of talismans and oflove-philtres,\' said Julia.\'It has ever been celebrated for its sorcerers,\' returned Nydia,timidly.\'Knowest thou, then, blind Thessalian, of any love-charms?\'\'I!\' said the flower-girl, coloring; \'I! how should I?  No, assuredlynot!\'\'The worse for thee; I could have given thee gold enough to havepurchased thy freedom hadst thou been more wise.\'\'But what,\' asked Nydia, \'can induce the beautiful and wealthy Julia toask that question of her servant?  Has she not money, and youth, andloveliness? Are they not love-charms enough to dispense with magic?\'\'To all but one person in the world,\' answered Julia, haughtily: \'butmethinks thy blindness is infectious; and...  But no matter.\'\'And that one person?\' said Nydia, eagerly.\'Is not Glaucus,\' replied Julia, with the customary deceit of her sex.\'Glaucus--no!\'Nydia drew her breath more freely, and after a short pause Juliarecommenced.\'But talking of Glaucus, and his attachment to this Neapolitan, remindedme of the influence of love-spells, which, for ought I know or care, shemay have exercised upon him.  Blind girl, I love, and--shall Julia liveto say it?--am loved not in return!  This humbles--nay, not humbles--butit stings my pride.  I would see this ingrate at my feet--not in orderthat I might raise, but that I might spurn him.  When they told me thouwert Thessalian, I imagined thy young mind might have learned the darksecrets of thy clime.\'\'Alas! no,\' murmured Nydia: \'would it had!\'\'Thanks, at least, for that kindly wish,\' said Julia, unconscious ofwhat was passing in the breast of the flower-girl.\'But tell me--thou hearest the gossip of slaves, always prone to thesedim beliefs; always ready to apply to sorcery for their own lowloves--hast thou ever heard of any Eastern magician in this city, whopossesses the art of which thou art ignorant?  No vain chiromancer, nojuggler of the market-place, but some more potent and mighty magician ofIndia or of Egypt?\'\'Of Egypt?--yes!\' said Nydia, shuddering.  \'What Pompeian has not heardof Arbaces?\'\'Arbaces! true,\' replied Julia, grasping at the recollection. \'Theysay he is a man above all the petty and false impostures of dullpretenders--that he is versed in the learning of the stars, and thesecrets of the ancient Nox; why not in the mysteries of love?\'\'If there be one magician living whose art is above that of others, itis that dread man,\' answered Nydia; and she felt her talisman while shespoke.\'He is too wealthy to divine for money?\' continued Julia, sneeringly.\'Can I not visit him?\'\'It is an evil mansion for the young and the beautiful,\' replied Nydia.\'I have heard, too, that he languishes in...\'\'An evil mansion!\' said Julia, catching only the first sentence. \'Whyso?\'\'The orgies of his midnight leisure are impure and polluted--at least,so says rumor.\'\'By Ceres, by Pan, and by Cybele! thou dost but provoke my curiosity,instead of exciting my fears,\' returned the wayward and pamperedPompeian. \'I will seek and question him of his lore.  If to these orgieslove be admitted--why the more likely that he knows its secrets!\'Nydia did not answer.\'I will seek him this very day,\' resumed Julia; \'nay, why not this veryhour?\'\'At daylight, and in his present state, thou hast assuredly the less tofear,\' answered Nydia, yielding to her own sudden and secret wish tolearn if the dark Egyptian were indeed possessed of those spells torivet and attract love, of which the Thessalian had so often heard.\'And who dare insult the rich daughter of Diomed?\' said Julia,haughtily. \'I will go.\'\'May I visit thee afterwards to learn the result?\' asked Nydia,anxiously.\'Kiss me for thy interest in Julia\'s honour,\' answered the lady. \'Yes,assuredly.  This eve we sup abroad--come hither at the same hourto-morrow, and thou shalt know all: I may have to employ thee too; butenough for the present.  Stay, take this bracelet for the new thoughtthou hast inspired me with; remember, if thou servest Julia, she isgrateful and she is generous.\'\'I cannot take thy present,\' said Nydia, putting aside the bracelet;\'but young as I am, I can sympathize unbought with those who love--andlove in vain.\'\'Sayest thou so!\' returned Julia.  \'Thou speakest like a free woman--andthou shalt yet be free--farewell!\'Chapter VIIIJULIA SEEKS ARBACES.  THE RESULT OF THAT INTERVIEW.ARBACES was seated in a chamber which opened on a kind of balcony orportico that fronted his garden.  His cheek was pale and worn with thesufferings he had endured, but his iron frame had already recovered fromthe severest effects of that accident which had frustrated his felldesigns in the moment of victory.  The air that came fragrantly to hisbrow revived his languid senses, and the blood circulated more freelythan it had done for days through his shrunken veins.\'So, then,\' thought he, \'the storm of fate has broken and blownover--the evil which my lore predicted, threatening life itself, haschanced--and yet I live!  It came as the stars foretold; and now thelong, bright, and prosperous career which was to succeed that evil, if Isurvived it, smiles beyond: I have passed--I have subdued the latestdanger of my destiny.  Now I have but to lay out the gardens of myfuture fate--unterrified and secure. First, then, of all my pleasures,even before that of love, shall come revenge!  This boy Greek--who hascrossed my passion--thwarted my designs--baffled me even when the bladewas about to drink his accursed blood--shall not a second time escapeme!  But for the method of my vengeance?  Of that let me ponder well!Oh! Ate, if thou art indeed a goddess, fill me with thy direstInspiration!\' The Egyptian sank into an intent reverie, which did notseem to present to him any clear or satisfactory suggestions.  Hechanged his position restlessly, as he revolved scheme after scheme,which no sooner occurred than it was dismissed: several times he struckhis breast and groaned aloud, with the desire of vengeance, and a senseof his impotence to accomplish it. While thus absorbed, a boy slavetimidly entered the chamber.A female, evidently of rank from her dress, and that of the single slavewho attended her, waited below and sought an audience with Arbaces.\'A female!\' his heart beat quick.  \'Is she young?\'\'Her face is concealed by her veil; but her form is slight, yet round,as that of youth.\'\'Admit her,\' said the Egyptian: for a moment his vain heart dreamed thestranger might be Ione.The first glance of the visitor now entering the apartment sufficed toundeceive so erring a fancy.  True, she was about the same height asIone, and perhaps the same age--true, she was finely and richlyformed--but where was that undulating and ineffable grace whichaccompanied every motion of the peerless Neapolitan--the chaste anddecorous garb, so simple even in the care of its arrangement--thedignified yet bashful step--the majesty of womanhood and its modesty?\'Pardon me that I rise with pain,\' said Arbaces, gazing on the stranger:\'I am still suffering from recent illness.\'\'Do not disturb thyself, O great Egyptian!\' returned Julia, seeking todisguise the fear she already experienced beneath the ready resort offlattery; \'and forgive an unfortunate female, who seeks consolation fromthy wisdom.\'\'Draw near, fair stranger,\' said Arbaces; \'and speak withoutapprehension or reserve.\'Julia placed herself on a seat beside the Egyptian, and wonderinglygazed around an apartment whose elaborate and costly luxuries shamedeven the ornate enrichment of her father\'s mansion; fearfully, too, sheregarded the hieroglyphical inscriptions on the walls--the faces of themysterious images, which at every corner gazed upon her--the tripod at alittle distance--and, above all, the grave and remarkable countenance ofArbaces himself: a long white robe like a veil half covered his ravenlocks, and flowed to his feet: his face was made even more impressive byits present paleness; and his dark and penetrating eyes seemed to piercethe shelter of her veil, and explore the secrets of her vain andunfeminine soul.\'And what,\' said his low, deep voice, \'brings thee, O maiden! to thehouse of the Eastern stranger?\'\'His fame,\' replied Julia.\'In what?\' said he, with a strange and slight smile.\'Canst thou ask, O wise Arbaces?  Is not thy knowledge the very gossiptheme of Pompeii?\'\'Some little lore have I indeed, treasured up,\' replied Arbaces: \'but inwhat can such serious and sterile secrets benefit the ear of beauty?\'\'Alas!\' said Julia, a little cheered by the accustomed accents ofadulation; \'does not sorrow fly to wisdom for relief, and they who loveunrequitedly, are not they the chosen victims of grief?\'\'Ha!\' said Arbaces, \'can unrequited love be the lot of so fair a form,whose modelled proportions are visible even beneath the folds of thygraceful robe?  Deign, O maiden! to lift thy veil, that I may see atleast if the face correspond in loveliness with the form.\'Not unwilling, perhaps, to exhibit her charms, and thinking they werelikely to interest the magician in her fate, Julia, after some slighthesitation, raised her veil, and revealed a beauty which, but for art,had been indeed attractive to the fixed gaze of the Egyptian.\'Thou comest to me for advice in unhappy love,\' said he; \'well, turnthat face on the ungrateful one: what other love-charm can I give thee?\'\'Oh, cease these courtesies!\' said Julia; \'it is a love-charm, indeed,that I would ask from thy skill!\'\'Fair stranger!\' replied Arbaces, somewhat scornfully, \'love-spells arenot among the secrets I have wasted the midnight oil to attain.\'\'Is it indeed so?  Then pardon me, great Arbaces, and farewell!\'\'Stay,\' said Arbaces, who, despite his passion for Ione, was not unmovedby the beauty of his visitor; and had he been in the flush of a moreassured health, might have attempted to console the fair Julia by othermeans than those of supernatural wisdom.\'Stay; although I confess that I have left the witchery of philtres andpotions to those whose trade is in such knowledge, yet am I myself notso dull to beauty but that in earlier youth I may have employed them inmy own behalf.  I may give thee advice, at least, if thou wilt be candidwith me. Tell me then, first, art thou unmarried, as thy dressbetokens?\'\'Yes,\' said Julia.\'And, being unblest with fortune, wouldst thou allure some wealthysuitor?\'\'I am richer than he who disdains me.\'\'Strange and more strange!  And thou lovest him who loves not thee?\'\'I know not if I love him,\' answered Julia, haughtily; \'but I know thatI would see myself triumph over a rival--I would see him who rejected memy suitor--I would see her whom he has preferred in her turn despised.\'\'A natural ambition and a womanly,\' said the Egyptian, in a tone toograve for irony.  \'Yet more, fair maiden; wilt thou confide to me thename of thy lover?  Can he be Pompeian, and despise wealth, even ifblind to beauty?\'\'He is of Athens,\' answered Julia, looking down.\'Ha!\' cried the Egyptian, impetuously, as the blood rushed to his cheek;\'there is but one Athenian, young and noble, in Pompeii. Can it beGlaucus of whom thou speakest!\'\'Ah! betray me not--so indeed they call him.\'The Egyptian sank back, gazing vacantly on the averted face of themerchant\'s daughter, and muttering inly to himself: this conference,with which he had hitherto only trifled, amusing himself with thecredulity and vanity of his visitor--might it not minister to hisrevenge?\'\'I see thou canst assist me not,\' said Julia, offended by his continuedsilence; \'guard at least my secret.  Once more, farewell!\'\'Maiden,\' said the Egyptian, in an earnest and serious tone, \'thy suithath touched me--I will minister to thy will.  Listen to me; I have notmyself dabbled in these lesser mysteries, but I know one who hath.  Atthe base of Vesuvius, less than a league from the city, there dwells apowerful witch; beneath the rank dews of the new moon, she has gatheredthe herbs which possess the virtue to chain Love in eternal fetters.Her art can bring thy lover to thy feet.  Seek her, and mention to herthe name of Arbaces: she fears that name, and will give thee her mostpotent philtres.\'\'Alas!\' answered Julia, I know not the road to the home of her whom thouspeakest of: the way, short though it be, is long to traverse for a girlwho leaves, unknown, the house of her father. The country is entangledwith wild vines, and dangerous with precipitous caverns.  I dare nottrust to mere strangers to guide me; the reputation of women of my rankis easily tarnished--and though I care not who knows that I loveGlaucus, I would not have it imagined that I obtained his love by aspell.\'\'Were I but three days advanced in health,\' said the Egyptian, risingand walking (as if to try his strength) across the chamber, but withirregular and feeble steps, \'I myself would accompany thee.  Well, thoumust wait.\'\'But Glaucus is soon to wed that hated Neapolitan.\'\'Wed!\'\'Yes; in the early part of next month.\'\'So soon!  Art thou well advised of this?\'\'From the lips of her own slave.\'\'It shall not be!\' said the Egyptian, impetuously.  \'Fear nothing,Glaucus shall be thine.  Yet how, when thou obtainest it, canst thouadminister to him this potion?\'\'My father has invited him, and, I believe, the Neapolitan also, to abanquet, on the day following to-morrow: I shall then have theopportunity to administer it.\'\'So be it!\' said the Egyptian, with eyes flashing such fierce joy, thatJulia\'s gaze sank trembling beneath them.  \'To-morrow eve, then, orderthy litter--thou hast one at thy command?\'\'Surely--yes,\' returned the purse-proud Julia.\'Order thy litter--at two miles\' distance from the city is a house ofentertainment, frequented by the wealthier Pompeians, from theexcellence of its baths, and the beauty of its gardens.  There canstthou pretend only to shape thy course--there, ill or dying, I will meetthee by the statue of Silenus, in the copse that skirts the garden; andI myself will guide thee to the witch.  Let us wait till, with theevening star, the goats of the herdsmen are gone to rest; when the darktwilight conceals us, and none shall cross our steps.  Go home and fearnot.  By Hades, swears Arbaces, the sorcerer of Egypt, that Ione shallnever wed with Glaucus.\'\'And that Glaucus shall be mine,\' added Julia, filling up theincompleted sentence.\'Thou hast said it!\' replied Arbaces; and Julia, half frightened at thisunhallowed appointment, but urged on by jealousy and the pique ofrivalship, even more than love, resolved to fulfill it.Left alone, Arbaces burst forth:\'Bright stars that never lie, ye already begin the execution of yourpromises--success in love, and victory over foes, for the rest of mysmooth existence.  In the very hour when my mind could devise no clue tothe goal of vengeance, have ye sent this fair fool for my guide?\' Hepaused in deep thought.  \'Yes,\' said he again, but in a calmer voice; \'Icould not myself have given to her the poison, that shall be indeed aphiltre!--his death might be thus tracked to my door.  But thewitch--ay, there is the fit, the natural agent of my designs!\'He summoned one of his slaves, bade him hasten to track the steps ofJulia, and acquaint himself with her name and condition.  This done, hestepped forth into the portico.  The skies were serene and clear; buthe, deeply read in the signs of their various change, beheld in one massof cloud, far on the horizon, which the wind began slowly to agitate,that a storm was brooding above.\'It is like my vengeance,\' said he, as he gazed; \'the sky is clear, butthe cloud moves on.\'Chapter IXSTORM IN THE SOUTH.  THE WITCH\'S CAVERN.IT was when the heats of noon died gradually away from the earth, thatGlaucus and Ione went forth to enjoy the cooled and grateful air.  Atthat time, various carriages were in use among the Romans; the one mostused by the richer citizens, when they required no companion in theirexcursion, was the biga, already described in the early portion of thiswork; that appropriated to the matrons, was termed carpentum, which hadcommonly two wheels; the ancients used also a sort of litter, a vastsedan-chair, more commodiously arranged than the modern, inasmuch as theoccupant thereof could lie down at ease, instead of beingperpendicularly and stiffly jostled up and down.  There was anothercarriage, used both for travelling and for excursions in the country; itwas commodious, containing three or four persons with ease, having acovering which could be raised at pleasure; and, in short, answeringvery much the purpose of (though very different in shape from) themodern britska.  It was a vehicle of this description that the lovers,accompanied by one female slave of Ione, now used in their excursion.About ten miles from the city, there was at that day an old ruin, theremains of a temple, evidently Grecian; and as for Glaucus and Ioneeverything Grecian possessed an interest, they had agreed to visit theseruins: it was thither they were now bound.Their road lay among vines and olive-groves; till, winding more and moretowards the higher ground of Vesuvius, the path grew rugged; the mulesmoved slowly, and with labor; and at every opening in the wood theybeheld those grey and horrent caverns indenting the parched rock, whichStrabo has described; but which the various revolutions of time and thevolcano have removed from the present aspect of the mountain.  The sun,sloping towards his descent, cast long and deep shadows over themountain; here and there they still heard the rustic reed of theshepherd amongst copses of the beechwood and wild oak.  Sometimes theymarked the form of the silk-haired and graceful capella, with itswreathing horn and bright grey eye--which, still beneath Ausonian skies,recalls the eclogues of Maro, browsing half-way up the hills; and thegrapes, already purple with the smiles of the deepening summer, glowedout from the arched festoons, which hung pendent from tree to tree.Above them, light clouds floated in the serene heavens, sweeping soslowly athwart the firmament that they scarcely seemed to stir; while,on their right, they caught, ever and anon, glimpses of the wavelesssea, with some light bark skimming its surface; and the sunlightbreaking over the deep in those countless and softest hues so peculiarto that delicious sea.\'How beautiful!\' said Glaucus, in a half-whispered tone, \'is thatexpression by which we call Earth our Mother!  With what a kindly equallove she pours her blessings upon her children! and even to thosesterile spots to which Nature has denied beauty, she yet contrives todispense her smiles: witness the arbutus and the vine, which shewreathes over the arid and burning soil of yon extinct volcano.  Ah! insuch an hour and scene as this, well might we imagine that the Faunshould peep forth from those green festoons; or, that we might trace thesteps of the Mountain Nymph through the thickest mazes of the glade.But the Nymphs ceased, beautiful Ione, when thou wert created!\'There is no tongue that flatters like a lover\'s; and yet, in theexaggeration of his feelings, flattery seems to him commonplace. Strangeand prodigal exuberance, which soon exhausts itself by overflowing!They arrived at the ruins; they examined them with that fondness withwhich we trace the hallowed and household vestiges of our ownancestry--they lingered there till Hesperus appeared in the rosyheavens; and then returning homeward in the twilight, they were moresilent than they had been; for in the shadow and beneath the stars theyfelt more oppressively their mutual love.It was at this time that the storm which the Egyptian had predictedbegan to creep visibly over them.  At first, a low and distant thundergave warning of the approaching conflict of the elements; and thenrapidly rushed above the dark ranks of the serried clouds.  Thesuddenness of storms in that climate is something almost preternatural,and might well suggest to early superstition the notion of a divineagency--a few large drops broke heavily among the boughs that halfoverhung their path, and then, swift and intolerably bright, the forkedlightning darted across their very eyes, and was swallowed up by theincreasing darkness.\'Swifter, good Carrucarius!\' cried Glaucus to the driver; \'the tempestcomes on apace.\'The slave urged on the mules--they went swift over the uneven and stonyroad--the clouds thickened, near and more near broke the thunder, andfast rushed the dashing rain.\'Dost thou fear?\' whispered Glaucus, as he sought excuse in the storm tocome nearer to Ione.\'Not with thee,\' said she, softly.At that instant, the carriage, fragile and ill-contrived (as, despitetheir graceful shapes, were, for practical uses, most of such inventionsat that time), struck violently into a deep rut, over which lay a log offallen wood; the driver, with a curse, stimulated his mules yet fasterfor the obstacle, the wheel was torn from the socket, and the carriagesuddenly overset.Glaucus, quickly extricating himself from the vehicle, hastened toassist Ione, who was fortunately unhurt; with some difficulty theyraised the carruca (or carriage), and found that it ceased any longereven to afford them shelter; the springs that fastened the covering weresnapped asunder, and the rain poured fast and fiercely into theinterior.In this dilemma, what was to be done?  They were yet some distance fromthe city--no house, no aid, seemed near.\'There is,\' said the slave, \'a smith about a mile off; I could seek him,and he might fasten at least the wheel to the carruca--but, Jupiter! howthe rain beats; my mistress will be wet before I come back.\'\'Run thither at least,\' said Glaucus; \'we must find the best shelter wecan till you return.\'The lane was overshadowed with trees, beneath the amplest of whichGlaucus drew Ione.  He endeavored, by stripping his own cloak, to shieldher yet more from the rapid rain; but it descended with a fury thatbroke through all puny obstacles: and suddenly, while Glaucus was yetwhispering courage to his beautiful charge, the lightning struck one ofthe trees immediately before them, and split with a mighty crash itshuge trunk in twain.  This awful incident apprised them of the dangerthey braved in their present shelter, and Glaucus looked anxiously roundfor some less perilous place of refuge.  \'We are now,\' said he,\'half-way up the ascent of Vesuvius; there ought to be some cavern, orhollow in the vine-clad rocks, could we but find it, in which thedeserting Nymphs have left a shelter.\' While thus saying he moved fromthe trees, and, looking wistfully towards the mountain, discoveredthrough the advancing gloom a red and tremulous light at no considerabledistance. \'That must come,\' said he, \'from the hearth of some shepherdor vine-dresser--it will guide us to some hospitable retreat.  Wilt thoustay here, while I--yet no--that would be to leave thee to danger.\'\'I will go with you cheerfully,\' said Ione.  \'Open as the space seems,it is better than the treacherous shelter of these boughs.\'Half leading, half carrying Ione, Glaucus, accompanied by the tremblingfemale slave, advanced towards the light, which yet burned red andsteadfastly.  At length the space was no longer open; wild vinesentangled their steps, and hid from them, save by imperfect intervals,the guiding beam.  But faster and fiercer came the rain, and thelightning assumed its most deadly and blasting form; they were stilltherefore, impelled onward, hoping, at last, if the light eluded them,to arrive at some cottage or some friendly cavern.  The vines grew moreand more intricate--the light was entirely snatched from them; but anarrow path, which they trod with labor and pain, guided only by theconstant and long-lingering flashes of the storm, continued to lead themtowards its direction.  The rain ceased suddenly; precipitous and roughcrags of scorched lava frowned before them, rendered more fearful by thelightning that illumined the dark and dangerous soil.  Sometimes theblaze lingered over the iron-grey heaps of scoria, covered in part withancient mosses or stunted trees, as if seeking in vain for some gentlerproduct of earth, more worthy of its ire; and sometimes leaving thewhole of that part of the scene in darkness, the lightning, broad andsheeted, hung redly over the ocean, tossing far below, until its wavesseemed glowing into fire; and so intense was the blaze, that it broughtvividly into view even the sharp outline of the more distant windings ofthe bay, from the eternal Misenum, with its lofty brow, to the beautifulSorrentum and the giant hills behind.Our lovers stopped in perplexity and doubt, when suddenly, as thedarkness that gloomed between the fierce flashes of lightning once morewrapped them round, they saw near, but high, before them, the mysteriouslight.  Another blaze, in which heaven and earth were reddened, madevisible to them the whole expanse; no house was near, but just wherethey had beheld the light, they thought they saw in the recess of thecavern the outline of a human form.  The darkness once more returned;the light, no longer paled beneath the fires of heaven, burned forthagain: they resolved to ascend towards it; they had to wind their wayamong vast fragments of stone, here and there overhung with wild bushes;but they gained nearer and nearer to the light, and at length they stoodopposite the mouth of a kind of cavern, apparently formed by hugesplinters of rock that had fallen transversely athwart each other: and,looking into the gloom, each drew back involuntarily with asuperstitious fear and chill.A fire burned in the far recess of the cave; and over it was a smallcauldron; on a tall and thin column of iron stood a rude lamp; over thatpart of the wall, at the base of which burned the fire, hung in manyrows, as if to dry, a profusion of herbs and weeds.  A fox, couchedbefore the fire, gazed upon the strangers with its bright and redeye--its hair bristling--and a low growl stealing from between itsteeth; in the centre of the cave was an earthen statue, which had threeheads of a singular and fantastic cast: they were formed by the realskulls of a dog, a horse, and a boar; a low tripod stood before thiswild representation of the popular Hecate.But it was not these appendages and appliances of the cave that thrilledthe blood of those who gazed fearfully therein--it was the face of itsinmate. Before the fire, with the light shining full upon her features,sat a woman of considerable age.  Perhaps in no country are there seenso many hags as in Italy--in no country does beauty so awfully change,in age, to hideousness the most appalling and revolting.  But the oldwoman now before them was not one of these specimens of the extreme ofhuman ugliness; on the contrary, her countenance betrayed the remains ofa regular but high and aquiline order of feature: with stony eyes turnedupon them--with a look that met and fascinated theirs--they beheld inthat fearful countenance the very image of a corpse!--the same, theglazed and lustreless regard, the blue and shrunken lips, the drawn andhollow jaw--the dead, lank hair, of a pale grey--the livid, green,ghastly skin, which seemed all surely tinged and tainted by the grave!\'It is a dead thing,\' said Glaucus.\'Nay--it stirs--it is a ghost or larva,\' faltered Ione, as she clung tothe Athenian\'s breast.\'Oh, away, away!\' groaned the slave, \'it is the Witch of Vesuvius!\'\'Who are ye?\' said a hollow and ghostly voice.  \'And what do ye here?\'The sound, terrible and deathlike as it was--suiting well thecountenance of the speaker, and seeming rather the voice of somebodiless wanderer of the Styx than living mortal, would have made Ioneshrink back into the pitiless fury of the storm, but Glaucus, though notwithout some misgiving, drew her into the cavern.\'We are storm-beaten wanderers from the neighboring city,\' said he, \'anddecoyed hither by yon light; we crave shelter and the comfort of yourhearth.\'As he spoke, the fox rose from the ground, and advanced towards thestrangers, showing, from end to end, its white teeth, and deepening inits menacing growl.\'Down, slave!\' said the witch; and at the sound of her voice the beastdropped at once, covering its face with its brush, and keeping only itsquick, vigilant eye fixed upon the invaders of its repose. \'Come to thefire if ye will!\' said she, turning to Glaucus and his companions.  \'Inever welcome living thing--save the owl, the fox, the toad, and theviper--so I cannot welcome ye; but come to the fire without welcome--whystand upon form?\'The language in which the hag addressed them was a strange and barbarousLatin, interlarded with many words of some more rude, and ancientdialect. She did not stir from her seat, but gazed stonily upon them asGlaucus now released Ione of her outer wrapping garments, and making herplace herself on a log of wood, which was the only other seat heperceived at hand--fanned with his breath the embers into a more glowingflame.  The slave, encouraged by the boldness of her superiors, divestedherself also of her long palla, and crept timorously to the oppositecorner of the hearth.\'We disturb you, I fear,\' said the silver voice of Ione, inconciliation.The witch did not reply--she seemed like one who has awakened for amoment from the dead, and has then relapsed once more into the eternalslumber.\'Tell me,\' said she, suddenly, and after a long pause, \'are ye brotherand sister?\'\'No,\' said Ione, blushing.\'Are ye married?\'\'Not so,\' replied Glaucus.\'Ho, lovers!--ha!--ha!--ha!\' and the witch laughed so loud and so longthat the caverns rang again.The heart of Ione stood still at that strange mirth.  Glaucus muttered arapid counterspell to the omen--and the slave turned as pale as thecheek of the witch herself.\'Why dost thou laugh, old crone?\' said Glaucus, somewhat sternly, as heconcluded his invocation.\'Did I laugh?\' said the hag, absently.\'She is in her dotage,\' whispered Glaucus: as he said this, he caughtthe eye of the hag fixed upon him with a malignant and vivid glare.\'Thou liest!\' said she, abruptly.\'Thou art an uncourteous welcomer,\' returned Glaucus.\'Hush! provoke her not, dear Glaucus!\' whispered Ione.\'I will tell thee why I laughed when I discovered ye were lovers,\' saidthe old woman.  \'It was because it is a pleasure to the old and witheredto look upon young hearts like yours--and to know the time will comewhen you will loathe each other--loathe--loathe--ha!--ha!--ha!\'It was now Ione\'s turn to pray against the unpleasing prophecy.\'The gods forbid!\' said she.  \'Yet, poor woman, thou knowest little oflove, or thou wouldst know that it never changes.\'\'Was I young once, think ye?\' returned the hag, quickly; \'and am I old,and hideous, and deathly now?  Such as is the form, so is the heart.\'With these words she sank again into a stillness profound and fearful,as if the cessation of life itself.\'Hast thou dwelt here long?\' said Glaucus, after a pause, feelinguncomfortably oppressed beneath a silence so appalling.\'Ah, long!--yes.\'\'It is but a drear abode.\'\'Ha! thou mayst well say that--Hell is beneath us!\' replied the hag,pointing her bony finger to the earth.  \'And I will tell thee asecret--the dim things below are preparing wrath for ye above--you, theyoung, and the thoughtless, and the beautiful.\'\'Thou utterest but evil words, ill becoming the hospitable,\' saidGlaucus; \'and in future I will brave the tempest rather than thywelcome.\'\'Thou wilt do well.  None should ever seek me--save the wretched!\'\'And why the wretched?\' asked the Athenian.\'I am the witch of the mountain,\' replied the sorceress, with a ghastlygrin; \'my trade is to give hope to the hopeless: for the crossed in loveI have philtres; for the avaricious, promises of treasure; for themalicious, potions of revenge; for the happy and the good, I have onlywhat life has--curses!  Trouble me no more.With this the grim tenant of the cave relapsed into a silence soobstinate and sullen, that Glaucus in vain endeavored to draw her intofarther conversation.  She did not evince, by any alteration of herlocked and rigid features, that she even heard him.  Fortunately,however, the storm, which was brief as violent, began now to relax; therain grew less and less fierce; and at last, as the clouds parted, themoon burst forth in the purple opening of heaven, and streamed clear andfull into that desolate abode.  Never had she shone, perhaps, on a groupmore worthy of the painter\'s art.  The young, the all-beautiful Ione,seated by that rude fire--her lover already forgetful of the presence ofthe hag, at her feet, gazing upward to her face, and whispering sweetwords--the pale and affrighted slave at a little distance--and theghastly hag resting her deadly eyes upon them; yet seemingly serene andfearless (for the companionship of love hath such power) were thesebeautiful beings, things of another sphere, in that dark and unholycavern, with its gloomy quaintness of appurtenance.  The fox regardedthem from his corner with his keen and fiery eye: and as Glaucus nowturned towards the witch, he perceived for the first time, just underher seat, the bright gaze and crested head of a large snake: whether itwas that the vivid coloring of the Athenian\'s cloak, thrown over theshoulders of Ione, attracted the reptile\'s anger--its crest began toglow and rise, as if menacing and preparing itself to spring upon theNeapolitan--Glaucus caught quickly at one of the half-burned logs uponthe hearth--and, as if enraged at the action, the snake came forth fromits shelter, and with a loud hiss raised itself on end till its heightnearly approached that of the Greek.\'Witch!\' cried Glaucus, \'command thy creature, or thou wilt see itdead.\'\'It has been despoiled of its venom!\' said the witch, aroused at histhreat; but ere the words had left her lip, the snake had sprung uponGlaucus; quick and watchful, the agile Greek leaped lightly aside, andstruck so fell and dexterous a blow on the head of the snake, that itfell prostrate and writhing among the embers of the fire.The hag sprung up, and stood confronting Glaucus with a face which wouldhave befitted the fiercest of the Furies, so utterly dire and wrathfulwas its expression--yet even in horror and ghastliness preserving theoutline and trace of beauty--and utterly free from that coarse grotesqueat which the imaginations of the North have sought the source of terror.\'Thou hast,\' said she, in a slow and steady voice--which belied theexpression of her face, so much was it passionless and calm--\'thou hasthad shelter under my roof, and warmth at my hearth; thou hast returnedevil for good; thou hast smitten and haply slain the thing that loved meand was mine: nay, more, the creature, above all others, consecrated togods and deemed venerable by man,--now hear thy punishment.  By themoon, who is the guardian of the sorceress--by Orcus, who is thetreasurer of wrath--I curse thee! and thou art cursed!  May thy love beblasted--may thy name be blackened--may the infernals mark thee--may thyheart wither and scorch--may thy last hour recall to thee the prophetvoice of the Saga of Vesuvius!  And thou,\' she added, turning sharplytowards Ione, and raising her right arm, when Glaucus burst impetuouslyon her speech:\'Hag!\' cried he, \'forbear!  Me thou hast cursed, and I commit myself tothe gods--I defy and scorn thee! but breathe but one word against yonmaiden, and I will convert the oath on thy foul lips to thy dying groan.Beware!\'\'I have done,\' replied the hag, laughing wildly; \'for in thy doom is shewho loves thee accursed.  And not the less, that I heard her lipsbreathe thy name, and know by what word to commend thee to the demons.Glaucus--thou art doomed!\' So saying, the witch turned from theAthenian, and kneeling down beside her wounded favorite, which shedragged from the hearth, she turned to them her face no more.\'O Glaucus!\' said Ione, greatly terrified, \'what have we done?--Let ushasten from this place; the storm has ceased.  Good mistress, forgivehim--recall thy words--he meant but to defend himself--accept thispeace-offering to unsay the said\': and Ione, stooping, placed her purseon the hag\'s lap.\'Away!\' said she, bitterly--\'away!  The oath once woven the Fates onlycan untie.  Away!\'\'Come, dearest!\' said Glaucus, impatiently.  \'Thinkest thou that thegods above us or below hear the impotent ravings of dotage?  Come!\'Long and loud rang the echoes of the cavern with the dread laugh of theSaga--she deigned no further reply.The lovers breathed more freely when they gained the open air: yet thescene they had witnessed, the words and the laughter of the witch, stillfearfully dwelt with Ione; and even Glaucus could not thoroughly shakeoff the impression they bequeathed.  The storm had subsided--save, nowand then, a low thunder muttered at the distance amidst the darkerclouds, or a momentary flash of lightning affronted the sovereignty ofthe moon.  With some difficulty they regained the road, where they foundthe vehicle already sufficiently repaired for their departure, and thecarrucarius calling loudly upon Hercules to tell him where his chargehad vanished.Glaucus vainly endeavored to cheer the exhausted spirits of Ione; andscarce less vainly to recover the elastic tone of his own naturalgaiety.  They soon arrived before the gate of the city: as it opened tothem, a litter borne by slaves impeded the way.\'It is too late for egress,\' cried the sentinel to the inmate of thelitter.\'Not so,\' said a voice, which the lovers started to hear; it was a voicethey well recognized.  \'I am bound to the villa of Marcus Polybius.  Ishall return shortly.  I am Arbaces the Egyptian.\'The scruples of him at the gate were removed, and the litter passedclose beside the carriage that bore the lovers.\'Arbaces, at this hour!--scarce recovered too, methinks!--Whither andfor what can he leave the city?\' said Glaucus.\'Alas!\' replied Ione, bursting into tears, \'my soul feels still more andmore the omen of evil.  Preserve us, O ye Gods! or at least,\' shemurmured inly, \'preserve my Glaucus!\'Chapter XTHE LORD OF THE BURNING BELT AND HIS MINION.  FATE WRITES HER PROPHECYIN RED LETTERS, BUT WHO SHALL READ THEM?ARBACES had tarried only till the cessation of the tempest allowed him,under cover of night, to seek the Saga of Vesuvius.  Borne by those ofhis trustier slaves in whom in all more secret expeditions he wasaccustomed to confide, he lay extended along his litter, and resigninghis sanguine heart to the contemplation of vengeance gratified and lovepossessed.  The slaves in so short a journey moved very little slowerthan the ordinary pace of mules; and Arbaces soon arrived at thecommencement of a narrow path, which the lovers had not been fortunateenough to discover; but which, skirting the thick vines, led at once tothe habitation of the witch.  Here he rested the litter; and bidding hisslaves conceal themselves and the vehicle among the vines from theobservation of any chance passenger, he mounted alone, with steps stillfeeble but supported by a long staff, the drear and sharp ascent.Not a drop of rain fell from the tranquil heaven; but the moisturedripped mournfully from the laden boughs of the vine, and now and thencollected in tiny pools in the crevices and hollows of the rocky way.\'Strange passions these for a philosopher,\' thought Arbaces, \'that leadone like me just new from the bed of death, and lapped even in healthamidst the roses of luxury, across such nocturnal paths as this; butPassion and Vengeance treading to their goal can make an Elysium of aTartarus.\' High, clear, and melancholy shone the moon above the road ofthat dark wayfarer, glossing herself in every pool that lay before him,and sleeping in shadow along the sloping mount. He saw before him thesame light that had guided the steps of his intended victims, but, nolonger contrasted by the blackened clouds, it shone less redly clear.He paused, as at length he approached the mouth of the cavern, torecover breath; and then, with his wonted collected and stately mien, hecrossed the unhallowed threshold.The fox sprang up at the ingress of this newcomer, and by a long howlannounced another visitor to his mistress.The witch had resumed her seat, and her aspect of gravelike and grimrepose. By her feet, upon a bed of dry weeds which half covered it, laythe wounded snake; but the quick eye of the Egyptian caught its scalesglittering in the reflected light of the opposite fire, as itwrithed--now contracting, now lengthening, its folds, in pain andunsated anger.\'Down, slave!\' said the witch, as before, to the fox; and, as before,the animal dropped to the ground--mute, but vigilant.\'Rise, servant of Nox and Erebus!\' said Arbaces, commandingly; \'asuperior in thine art salutes thee! rise, and welcome him.\'At these words the hag turned her gaze upon the Egyptian\'s towering formand dark features.  She looked long and fixedly upon him, as he stoodbefore her in his Oriental robe, and folded arms, and steadfast andhaughty brow.  \'Who art thou,\' she said at last, \'that callest thyselfgreater in art than the Saga of the Burning Fields, and the daughter ofthe perished Etrurian race?\'\'I am he,\' answered Arbaces, \'from whom all cultivators of magic, fromnorth to south, from east to west, from the Ganges and the Nile to thevales of Thessaly and the shores of the yellow Tiber, have stooped tolearn.\'\'There is but one such man in these places,\' answered the witch, \'whomthe men of the outer world, unknowing his loftier attributes and moresecret fame, call Arbaces the Egyptian: to us of a higher nature anddeeper knowledge, his rightful appellation is Hermes of the BurningGirdle.\'\'Look again, returned Arbaces: \'I am he.\'As he spoke he drew aside his robe, and revealed a cincture seemingly offire, that burned around his waist, clasped in the centre by a platewhereon was engraven some sign apparently vague and unintelligible butwhich was evidently not unknown to the Saga.  She rose hastily, andthrew herself at the feet of Arbaces.  \'I have seen, then,\' said she, ina voice of deep humility, \'the Lord of the Mighty Girdle--vouchsafe myhomage.\'\'Rise,\' said the Egyptian; \'I have need of thee.\'So saying, he placed himself on the same log of wood on which Ione hadrested before, and motioned to the witch to resume her seat.\'Thou sayest,\' said he, as she obeyed, \'that thou art a daughter of theancient Etrurian tribes; the mighty walls of whose rock-built cities yetfrown above the robber race that hath seized upon their ancient reign.Partly came those tribes from Greece, partly were they exiles from amore burning and primeval soil.  In either case art thou of Egyptianlineage, for the Grecian masters of the aboriginal helot were among therestless sons whom the Nile banished from her bosom.  Equally, then, OSaga! thy descent is from ancestors that swore allegiance to mine own.By birth as by knowledge, art thou the subject of Arbaces.  Hear me,then, and obey!\'The witch bowed her head.\'Whatever art we possess in sorcery,\' continued Arbaces, \'we aresometimes driven to natural means to attain our object.  The ring andthe crystal, and the ashes and the herbs, do not give unerringdivinations; neither do the higher mysteries of the moon yield even thepossessor of the girdle a dispensation from the necessity of employingever and anon human measures for a human object.  Mark me, then: thouart deeply skilled, methinks, in the secrets of the more deadly herbs;thou knowest those which arrest life, which burn and scorch the soulfrom out her citadel, or freeze the channels of young blood into thatice which no sun can melt.  Do I overrate thy skill?  Speak, and truly!\'\'Mighty Hermes, such lore is, indeed, mine own.  Deign to look at theseghostly and corpse-like features; they have waned from the hues of lifemerely by watching over the rank herbs which simmer night and day in yoncauldron.\'The Egyptian moved his seat from so unblessed or so unhealthful avicinity as the witch spoke.\'It is well,\' said he; \'thou hast learned that maxim of all the deeperknowledge which saith, ""Despise the body to make wise the mind."" But tothy task.  There cometh to thee by to-morrow\'s starlight a vain maiden,seeking of thine art a love-charm to fascinate from another the eyesthat should utter but soft tales to her own: instead of thy philtres,give the maiden one of thy most powerful poisons.  Let the lover breathehis vows to the Shades.\'The witch trembled from head to foot.\'Oh pardon! pardon! dread master,\' said she, falteringly, \'but this Idare not.  The law in these cities is sharp and vigilant; they willseize, they will slay me.\'\'For what purpose, then, thy herbs and thy potions, vain Saga?\' saidArbaces, sneeringly.The witch hid her loathsome face with her hands.\'Oh! years ago,\' said she, in a voice unlike her usual tones, soplaintive was it, and so soft, \'I was not the thing that I am now.  Iloved, I fancied myself beloved.\'\'And what connection hath thy love, witch, with my commands?\' saidArbaces, impetuously.\'Patience,\' resumed the witch; \'patience, I implore.  I loved! anotherand less fair than I--yes, by Nemesis! less fair--allured from me mychosen.  I was of that dark Etrurian tribe to whom most of all wereknown the secrets of the gloomier magic.  My mother was herself a saga:she shared the resentment of her child; from her hands I received thepotion that was to restore me his love; and from her, also, the poisonthat was to destroy my rival.  Oh, crush me, dread walls! my tremblinghands mistook the phials, my lover fell indeed at my feet; but dead!dead! dead!  Since then, what has been life to me I became suddenly old,I devoted myself to the sorceries of my race; still by an irresistibleimpulse I curse myself with an awful penance; still I seek the mostnoxious herbs; still I concoct the poisons; still I imagine that I am togive them to my hated rival; still I pour them into the phial; still Ifancy that they shall blast her beauty to the dust; still I wake and seethe quivering body, the foaming lips, the glazing eyes of myAulus--murdered, and by me!\'The skeleton frame of the witch shook beneath strong convulsions.Arbaces gazed upon her with a curious though contemptuous eye.\'And this foul thing has yet human emotions!\' thought he; \'still shecowers over the ashes of the same fire that consumes Arbaces!--Such arewe all! Mystic is the tie of those mortal passions that unite thegreatest and the least.\'He did not reply till she had somewhat recovered herself, and now satrocking to and fro in her seat, with glassy eyes fixed on the oppositeflame, and large tears rolling down her livid cheeks.\'A grievous tale is thine, in truth,\' said Arbaces.  \'But these emotionsare fit only for our youth--age should harden our hearts to all thingsbut ourselves; as every year adds a scale to the shell-fish, so shouldeach year wall and incrust the heart.  Think of those frenzies no more!And now, listen to me again!  By the revenge that was dear to thee, Icommand thee to obey me! it is for vengeance that I seek thee!  Thisyouth whom I would sweep from my path has crossed me, despite myspells:--this thing of purple and broidery, of smiles and glances,soulless and mindless, with no charm but that of beauty--accursed beit!--this insect--this Glaucus--I tell thee, by Orcus and by Nemesis, hemust die.\'And working himself up at every word, the Egyptian, forgetful of hisdebility--of his strange companion--of everything but his own vindictiverage, strode, with large and rapid steps, the gloomy cavern.\'Glaucus! saidst thou, mighty master!\' said the witch, abruptly; and herdim eye glared at the name with all that fierce resentment at the memoryof small affronts so common amongst the solitary and the shunned.\'Ay, so he is called; but what matters the name?  Let it not be heard asthat of a living man three days from this date!\'\'Hear me!\' said the witch, breaking from a short reverie into which shewas plunged after this last sentence of the Egyptian. \'Hear me! I am thything and thy slave! spare me!  If I give to the maiden thou speakest ofthat which would destroy the life of Glaucus, I shall be surelydetected--the dead ever find avengers.  Nay, dread man! if thy visit tome be tracked, if thy hatred to Glaucus be known, thou mayest have needof thy archest magic to protect thyself!\'\'Ha!\' said Arbaces, stopping suddenly short; and as a proof of thatblindness with which passion darkens the eyes even of the most acute,this was the first time when the risk that he himself ran by this methodof vengeance had occurred to a mind ordinarily wary and circumspect.\'But,\' continued the witch, \'if instead of that which shall arrest theheart, I give that which shall sear and blast the brain--which shallmake him who quaffs it unfit for the uses and career of life--an abject,raving, benighted thing--smiting sense to drivelling youth todotage--will not thy vengeance be equally sated--thy object equallyattained?\'\'Oh, witch! no longer the servant, but the sister--the equal ofArbaces--how much brighter is woman\'s wit, even in vengeance, than ours!how much more exquisite than death is such a doom!\'\'And,\' continued the hag, gloating over her fell scheme, \'in this is butlittle danger; for by ten thousand methods, which men forbear to seek,can our victim become mad.  He may have been among the vines and seen anymph--or the vine itself may have had the same effect--ha, ha! theynever inquire too scrupulously into these matters in which the gods maybe agents. And let the worst arrive--let it be known that it is alove-charm--why, madness is a common effect of philtres; and even thefair she that gave it finds indulgence in the excuse. Mighty Hermes,have I ministered to thee cunningly?\'\'Thou shalt have twenty years\' longer date for this,\' returned Arbaces.\'I will write anew the epoch of thy fate on the face of the palestars--thou shalt not serve in vain the Master of the Flaming Belt.  Andhere, Saga, carve thee out, by these golden tools, a warmer cell in thisdreary cavern--one service to me shall countervail a thousanddivinations by sieve and shears to the gaping rustics.\' So saying, hecast upon the floor a heavy purse, which clinked not unmusically to theear of the hag, who loved the consciousness of possessing the means topurchase comforts she disdained. \'Farewell,\' said Arbaces, \'failnot--outwatch the stars in concocting thy beverage--thou shalt lord itover thy sisters at the Walnut-tree,\' when thou tellest them that thypatron and thy friend is Hermes the Egyptian. To-morrow night we meetagain.\'He stayed not to hear the valediction or the thanks of the witch; with aquick step he passed into the moonlit air, and hastened down themountain.The witch, who followed his steps to the threshold, stood at theentrance of the cavern, gazing fixedly on his receding form; and as thesad moonlight streamed over her shadowy form and deathlike face,emerging from the dismal rocks, it seemed as if one gifted, indeed, bysupernatural magic had escaped from the dreary Orcus; and, the foremostof its ghostly throng, stood at its black portals--vainly summoning hisreturn, or vainly sighing to rejoin him. The hag, then slowlyre-entering the cave, groaningly picked up the heavy purse, took thelamp from its stand, and, passing to the remotest depth of her cell, ablack and abrupt passage, which was not visible, save at a nearapproach, closed round as it was with jutting and sharp crags, yawnedbefore her: she went several yards along this gloomy path, which slopedgradually downwards, as if towards the bowels of the earth, and, liftinga stone, deposited her treasure in a hole beneath, which, as the lamppierced its secrets, seemed already to contain coins of various value,wrung from the credulity or gratitude of her visitors.\'I love to look at you,\' said she, apostrophising the moneys; \'for whenI see you I feel that I am indeed of power.  And I am to have twentyyears\' longer life to increase your store! O thou great Hermes!\'She replaced the stone, and continued her path onward for some paces,when she stopped before a deep irregular fissure in the earth.  Here, asshe bent--strange, rumbling, hoarse, and distant sounds might be heard,while ever and anon, with a loud and grating noise which, to use ahomely but faithful simile, seemed to resemble the grinding of steelupon wheels, volumes of streaming and dark smoke issued forth, andrushed spirally along the cavern.\'The Shades are noisier than their wont,\' said the hag, shaking her greylocks; and, looking into the cavity, she beheld, far down, glimpses of along streak of light, intensely but darkly red. \'Strange!\' she said,shrinking back; \'it is only within the last two days that dull, deeplight hath been visible--what can it portend?\'The fox, who had attended the steps of his fell mistress, uttered adismal howl, and ran cowering back to the inner cave; a cold shudderingseized the hag herself at the cry of the animal, which, causeless as itseemed, the superstitions of the time considered deeply ominous.  Shemuttered her placatory charm, and tottered back into her cavern, where,amidst her herbs and incantations, she prepared to execute the orders ofthe Egyptian.\'He called me dotard,\' said she, as the smoke curled from the hissingcauldron: \'when the jaws drop, and the grinders fall, and the heartscarce beats, it is a pitiable thing to dote; but when,\' she added, witha savage and exulting grin, \'the young, and the beautiful, and thestrong, are suddenly smitten into idiocy--ah, that is terrible!  Burn,flame--simmer herb--swelter toad--I cursed him, and he shall be cursed!\'On that night, and at the same hour which witnessed the dark and unholyinterview between Arbaces and the Saga, Apaecides was baptized.Chapter XIPROGRESS OF EVENTS.  THE PLOT THICKENS.  THE WEB IS WOVEN, BUT THE NETCHANGES HANDS.\'AND you have the courage then, Julia, to seek the Witch of Vesuviusthis evening; in company, too, with that fearful man?\'\'Why, Nydia?\' replied Julia, timidly; \'dost thou really think there isanything to dread?  These old hags, with their enchanted mirrors, theirtrembling sieves, and their moon-gathered herbs, are, I imagine, butcrafty impostors, who have learned, perhaps, nothing but the very charmfor which I apply to their skill, and which is drawn but from theknowledge of the field\'s herbs and simples. Wherefore should I dread?\'\'Dost thou not fear thy companion?\'\'What, Arbaces?  By Dian, I never saw lover more courteous than thatsame magician!  And were he not so dark, he would be even handsome.\'Blind as she was, Nydia had the penetration to perceive that Julia\'smind was not one that the gallantries of Arbaces were likely to terrify.She therefore dissuaded her no more: but nursed in her excited heart thewild and increasing desire to know if sorcery had indeed a spell tofascinate love to love.\'Let me go with thee, noble Julia,\' said she at length; \'my presence isno protection, but I should like to be beside thee to the last.\'\'Thine offer pleases me much,\' replied the daughter of Diomed. \'Yet howcanst thou contrive it? we may not return until late, they will missthee.\'\'Ione is indulgent,\' replied Nydia.  \'If thou wilt permit me to sleepbeneath thy roof, I will say that thou, an early patroness and friend,hast invited me to pass the day with thee, and sing thee my Thessaliansongs; her courtesy will readily grant to thee so light a boon.\'\'Nay, ask for thyself!\' said the haughty Julia.  \'I stoop to request nofavor from the Neapolitan!\'\'Well, be it so.  I will take my leave now; make my request, which Iknow will be readily granted, and return shortly.\'\'Do so; and thy bed shall be prepared in my own chamber.\' With that,Nydia left the fair Pompeian.On her way back to Ione she was met by the chariot of Glaucus, on whosefiery and curveting steeds was riveted the gaze of the crowded street.He kindly stopped for a moment to speak to the flower-girl.\'Blooming as thine own roses, my gentle Nydia! and how is thy fairmistress?--recovered, I trust, from the effects of the storm?\'\'I have not seen her this morning,\' answered Nydia, \'but...\'\'But what? draw back--the horses are too near thee.\'\'But think you Ione will permit me to pass the day with Julia, thedaughter of Diomed?--She wishes it, and was kind to me when I had fewfriends.\'\'The gods bless thy grateful heart!  I will answer for Ione\'spermission.\'\'Then I may stay over the night, and return to-morrow?\' said Nydia,shrinking from the praise she so little merited.\'As thou and fair Julia please.  Commend me to her; and hark ye, Nydia,when thou hearest her speak, note the contrast of her voice with that ofthe silver-toned Ione.  Vale!\'His spirits entirely recovered from the effect of the past night, hislocks waving in the wind, his joyous and elastic heart bounding withevery spring of his Parthian steeds, a very prototype of his country\'sgod, full of youth and of love--Glaucus was borne rapidly to hismistress.Enjoy while ye may the present--who can read the future?As the evening darkened, Julia, reclined within her litter, which wascapacious enough also to admit her blind companion, took her way to therural baths indicated by Arbaces.  To her natural levity of disposition,her enterprise brought less of terror than of pleasurable excitement;above all, she glowed at the thought of her coming triumph over thehated Neapolitan.A small but gay group was collected round the door of the villa, as herlitter passed by it to the private entrance of the baths appropriated tothe women.\'Methinks, by this dim light,\' said one of the bystanders, \'I recognizethe slaves of Diomed.\'\'True, Clodius,\' said Sallust: \'it is probably the litter of hisdaughter Julia.  She is rich, my friend; why dost thou not proffer thysuit to her?\'\'Why, I had once hoped that Glaucus would have married her.  She doesnot disguise her attachment; and then, as he gambles freely and withill-success...\'\'The sesterces would have passed to thee, wise Clodius.  A wife is agood thing--when it belongs to another man!\'\'But,\' continued Clodius, \'as Glaucus is, I understand, to wed theNeapolitan, I think I must even try my chance with the dejected maid.After all, the lamp of Hymen will be gilt, and the vessel will reconcileone to the odor of the flame.  I shall only protest, my Sallust, againstDiomed\'s making thee trustee to his daughter\'s fortune.\'\'Ha! ha! let us within, my comissator; the wine and the garlands waitus.\'Dismissing her slaves to that part of the house set apart for theirentertainment, Julia entered the baths with Nydia, and declining theoffers of the attendants, passed by a private door into the gardenbehind.\'She comes by appointment, be sure,\' said one of the slaves.\'What is that to thee?\' said a superintendent, sourly; \'she pays for thebaths, and does not waste the saffron.  Such appointments are the bestpart of the trade.  Hark! do you not hear the widow Fulvia clapping herhands? Run, fool--run!\'Julia and Nydia, avoiding the more public part of the garden, arrived atthe place specified by the Egyptian.  In a small circular plot of grassthe stars gleamed upon the statue of Silenus--the merry god reclinedupon a fragment of rock--the lynx of Bacchus at his feet--and over hismouth he held, with extended arm, a bunch of grapes, which he seeminglylaughed to welcome ere he devoured.\'I see not the magician,\' said Julia, looking round: when, as she spoke,the Egyptian slowly emerged from the neighboring foliage, and the lightfell palely over his sweeping robes.\'Salve, sweet maiden!--But ha! whom hast thou here? we must have nocompanions!\'\'It is but the blind flower-girl, wise magician,\' replied Julia:\'herself a Thessalian.\'\'Oh! Nydia!\' said the Egyptian.  \'I know her well.\'Nydia drew back and shuddered.\'Thou hast been at my house, methinks!\' said he, approaching his voiceto Nydia\'s ear; \'thou knowest the oath!--Silence and secrecy, now asthen, or beware!\'\'Yet,\' he added, musingly to himself, \'why confide more than isnecessary, even in the blind--Julia, canst thou trust thyself alone withme?  Believe me, the magician is less formidable than he seems.\'As he spoke, he gently drew Julia aside.\'The witch loves not many visitors at once,\' said he: \'leave Nydia heretill your return; she can be of no assistance to us: and, forprotection--your own beauty suffices--your own beauty and your own rank;yes, Julia, I know thy name and birth.  Come, trust thyself with me,fair rival of the youngest of the Naiads!\'The vain Julia was not, as we have seen, easily affrighted; she wasmoved by the flattery of Arbaces, and she readily consented to sufferNydia to await her return; nor did Nydia press her presence.  At thesound of the Egyptian\'s voice all her terror of him returned: she felt asentiment of pleasure at learning she was not to travel in hiscompanionship.She returned to the Bath-house, and in one of the private chamberswaited their return.  Many and bitter were the thoughts of this wildgirl as she sat there in her eternal darkness.  She thought of her owndesolate fate, far from her native land, far from the bland cares thatonce assuaged the April sorrows of childhood--deprived of the light ofday, with none but strangers to guide her steps, accursed by the onesoft feeling of her heart, loving and without hope, save the dim andunholy ray which shot across her mind, as her Thessalian fanciesquestioned of the force of spells and the gifts of magic.Nature had sown in the heart of this poor girl the seeds of virtuenever destined to ripen.  The lessons of adversity are not alwayssalutary--sometimes they soften and amend, but as often they indurateand pervert. If we consider ourselves more harshly treated by fate thanthose around us, and do not acknowledge in our own deeds the justice ofthe severity, we become too apt to deem the world our enemy, to caseourselves in defiance, to wrestle against our softer self, and toindulge the darker passions which are so easily fermented by the senseof injustice.  Sold early into slavery, sentenced to a sordidtaskmaster, exchanging her situation, only yet more to embitter herlot--the kindlier feelings, naturally profuse in the breast of Nydia,were nipped and blighted.  Her sense of right and wrong was confused bya passion to which she had so madly surrendered herself; and the sameintense and tragic emotions which we read of in the women of the classicage--a Myrrha, a Medea--and which hurried and swept away the whole soulwhen once delivered to love--ruled, and rioted in, her breast.Time passed: a light step entered the chamber where Nydia yet indulgedher gloomy meditations.\'Oh, thanked be the immortal gods!\' said Julia, \'I have returned, I haveleft that terrible cavern!  Come, Nydia! let us away forthwith!\'It was not till they were seated in the litter that Julia again spoke.\'Oh!\' said she, tremblingly, \'such a scene! such fearful incantations!and the dead face of the hag!--But, let us talk not of it.  I haveobtained the potion--she pledges its effect.  My rival shall be suddenlyindifferent to his eye, and I, I alone, the idol of Glaucus!\'\'Glaucus!\' exclaimed Nydia.\'Ay! I told thee, girl, at first, that it was not the Athenian whom Iloved: but I see now that I may trust thee wholly--it is the beautifulGreek!\'What then were Nydia\'s emotions! she had connived, she had assisted, intearing Glaucus from Ione; but only to transfer, by all the power ofmagic, his affections yet more hopelessly to another.  Her heart swelledalmost to suffocation--she gasped for breath--in the darkness of thevehicle, Julia did not perceive the agitation of her companion; she wenton rapidly dilating on the promised effect of her acquisition, and onher approaching triumph over Ione, every now and then abruptlydigressing to the horror of the scene she had quitted--the unmoved mienof Arbaces, and his authority over the dreadful Saga.Meanwhile Nydia recovered her self-possession: a thought flashed acrossher: she slept in the chamber of Julia--she might possess herself of thepotion.They arrived at the house of Diomed, and descended to Julia\'s apartment,where the night\'s repast awaited them.\'Drink, Nydia, thou must be cold, the air was chill to-night; as for me,my veins are yet ice.\'And Julia unhesitatingly quaffed deep draughts of the spiced wine.\'Thou hast the potion,\' said Nydia; \'let me hold it in my hands. Howsmall the phial is! of what color is the draught?\'\'Clear as crystal,\' replied Julia, as she retook the philtre; \'thoucouldst not tell it from this water.  The witch assures me it istasteless.  Small though the phial, it suffices for a life\'s fidelity:it is to be poured into any liquid; and Glaucus will only know what hehas quaffed by the effect.\'\'Exactly like this water in appearance?\'\'Yes, sparkling and colorless as this.  How bright it seems! it is asthe very essence of moonlit dews.  Bright thing! how thou shinest on myhopes through thy crystal vase!\'\'And how is it sealed?\'\'But by one little stopper--I withdraw it now--the draught gives noodor. Strange, that that which speaks to neither sense should thuscommand all!\'\'Is the effect instantaneous?\'\'Usually--but sometimes it remains dormant for a few hours.\'\'Oh, how sweet is this perfume!\' said Nydia, suddenly, as she took up asmall bottle on the table, and bent over its fragrant contents.\'Thinkest thou so? the bottle is set with gems of some value.  Thouwouldst not have the bracelet yestermorn--wilt thou take the bottle?\'\'It ought to be such perfumes as these that should remind one who cannotsee of the generous Julia.  If the bottle be not too costly...\'\'Oh! I have a thousand costlier ones: take it, child!\'Nydia bowed her gratitude, and placed the bottle in her vest.\'And the draught would be equally efficacious, whoever administers it?\'\'If the most hideous hag beneath the sun bestowed it, such is itsasserted virtue that Glaucus would deem her beautiful, and none buther!\'Julia, warmed by wine, and the reaction of her spirits, was now allanimation and delight; she laughed loud, and talked on a hundredmatters--nor was it till the night had advanced far towards morning thatshe summoned her slaves and undressed.When they were dismissed, she said to Nydia, \'I will not suffer thisholy draught to quit my presence till the hour comes for its use. Lieunder my pillow, bright spirit, and give me happy dreams!\'So saying, she placed the potion under her pillow.  Nydia\'s heart beatviolently.\'Why dost thou drink that unmixed water, Nydia?  Take the wine by itsside.\'\'I am fevered,\' replied the blind girl, \'and the water cools me.  I willplace this bottle by my bedside, it refreshes in these summer nights,when the dews of sleep fall not on our lips.  Fair Julia, I must leavethee very early--so Ione bids--perhaps before thou art awake; accept,therefore, now my congratulations.\'\'Thanks: when next we meet you may find Glaucus at my feet.\'They had retired to their couches, and Julia, worn out by the excitementof the day, soon slept.  But anxious and burning thoughts rolled overthe mind of the wakeful Thessalian.  She listened to the calm breathingof Julia; and her ear, accustomed to the finest distinctions of sound,speedily assured her of the deep slumber of her companion.\'Now befriend me, Venus!\' said she, softly.She rose gently, and poured the perfume from the gift of Julia upon themarble floor--she rinsed it several times carefully with the water thatwas beside her, and then easily finding the bed of Julia (for night toher was as day), she pressed her trembling hand under the pillow andseized the potion.  Julia stirred not, her breath regularly fanned theburning cheek of the blind girl.  Nydia, then, opening the phial, pouredits contents into the bottle, which easily contained them; and thenrefilling the former reservoir of the potion with that limpid waterwhich Julia had assured her it so resembled, she once more placed thephial in its former place.  She then stole again to her couch, andwaited--with what thoughts!--the dawning day.The sun had risen--Julia slept still--Nydia noiselessly dressed herself,placed her treasure carefully in her vest, took up her staff, andhastened to quit the house.The porter, Medon, saluted her kindly as she descended the steps thatled to the street: she heard him not; her mind was confused and lost inthe whirl of tumultuous thoughts, each thought a passion. She felt thepure morning air upon her cheek, but it cooled not her scorching veins.\'Glaucus,\' she murmured, \'all the love-charms of the wildest magic couldnot make thee love me as I love thee.  Ione!--ah; away hesitation! awayremorse! Glaucus, my fate is in thy smile; and thine! hope!  O joy!  Otransport, thy fate is in these hands!\'BOOK THE FOURTHChapter IREFLECTIONS ON THE ZEAL OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS.  TWO MEN COME TO APERILOUS RESOLVE.  WALLS HAVE EARS, PARTICULARLY SACRED WALLS.WHOEVER regards the early history of Christianity, will perceive hownecessary to its triumph was that fierce spirit of zeal, which, fearingno danger, accepting no compromise, inspired its champions and sustainedits martyrs.  In a dominant Church the genius of intolerance betrays itscause--in a weak and persecuted Church, the same genius mainly supports.It was necessary to scorn, to loathe, to abhor the creeds of other men,in order to conquer the temptations which they presented--it wasnecessary rigidly to believe not only that the Gospel was the truefaith, but the sole true faith that saved, in order to nerve thedisciple to the austerity of its doctrine, and to encourage him to thesacred and perilous chivalry of converting the Polytheist and theHeathen.  The sectarian sternness which confined virtue and heaven to achosen few, which saw demons in other gods, and the penalties of hell inother religions--made the believer naturally anxious to convert all towhom he felt the ties of human affection; and the circle thus traced bybenevolence to man was yet more widened by a desire for the glory ofGod.  It was for the honour of the Christian faith that the Christianboldly forced its tenets upon the scepticism of some, the repugnance ofothers, the sage contempt of the philosopher, the pious shudder of thepeople--his very intolerance supplied him with his fittest instrumentsof success; and the soft Heathen began at last to imagine there mustindeed be something holy in a zeal wholly foreign to his experience,which stopped at no obstacle, dreaded no danger, and even at thetorture, or on the scaffold, referred a dispute far other than the calmdifferences of speculative philosophy to the tribunal of an EternalJudge.  It was thus that the same fervor which made the Churchman of themiddle age a bigot without mercy, made the Christian of the early days ahero without fear.Of these more fiery, daring, and earnest natures, not the least ardentwas Olinthus.  No sooner had Apaecides been received by the rites ofbaptism into the bosom of the Church, than the Nazarene hastened to makehim conscious of the impossibility to retain the office and robes ofpriesthood. He could not, it was evident, profess to worship God, andcontinue even outwardly to honour the idolatrous altars of the Fiend.Nor was this all, the sanguine and impetuous mind of Olinthus beheld inthe power of Apaecides the means of divulging to the deluded people thejuggling mysteries of the oracular Isis.  He thought Heaven had sentthis instrument of his design in order to disabuse the eyes of thecrowd, and prepare the way, perchance, for the conversion of a wholecity.  He did not hesitate then to appeal to all the new-kindledenthusiasm of Apaecides, to arouse his courage, and to stimulate hiszeal.  They met, according to previous agreement, the evening after thebaptism of Apaecides, in the grove of Cybele, which we have beforedescribed.\'At the next solemn consultation of the oracle,\' said Olinthus, as heproceeded in the warmth of his address, \'advance yourself to therailing, proclaim aloud to the people the deception they endure, invitethem to enter, to be themselves the witness of the gross but artfulmechanism of imposture thou hast described to me.  Fear not--the Lord,who protected Daniel, shall protect thee; we, the community ofChristians, will be amongst the crowd; we will urge on the shrinking:and in the first flush of the popular indignation and shame, I myself,upon those very altars, will plant the palm-branch typical of theGospel--and to my tongue shall descend the rushing Spirit of the livingGod.\'Heated and excited as he was, this suggestion was not unpleasing toApaecides.  He was rejoiced at so early an opportunity of distinguishinghis faith in his new sect, and to his holier feelings were added thoseof a vindictive loathing at the imposition he had himself suffered, anda desire to avenge it.  In that sanguine and elastic overbound ofobstacles (the rashness necessary to all who undertake venturous andlofty actions), neither Olinthus nor the proselyte perceived theimpediments to the success of their scheme, which might be found in thereverent superstition of the people themselves, who would probably beloth, before the sacred altars of the great Egyptian goddess, to believeeven the testimony of her priest against her power.Apaecides then assented to this proposal with a readiness whichdelighted Olinthus.  They parted with the understanding that Olinthusshould confer with the more important of his Christian brethren on hisgreat enterprise, should receive their advice and the assurances oftheir support on the eventful day.  It so chanced that one of thefestivals of Isis was to be held on the second day after thisconference.  The festival proffered a ready occasion for the design.They appointed to meet once more on the next evening at the same spot;and in that meeting were finally to be settled the order and details ofthe disclosure for the following day.It happened that the latter part of this conference had been held nearthe sacellum, or small chapel, which I have described in the early partof this work; and so soon as the forms of the Christian and the priesthad disappeared from the grove, a dark and ungainly figure emerged frombehind the chapel.\'I have tracked you with some effect, my brother flamen,\' soliloquisedthe eavesdropper; \'you, the priest of Isis, have not for mere idlediscussion conferred with this gloomy Christian.  Alas! that I could nothear all your precious plot: enough!  I find, at least, that youmeditate revealing the sacred mysteries, and that to-morrow you meetagain at this place to plan the how and the when. May Osiris sharpen myears then, to detect the whole of your unheard-of audacity!  When I havelearned more, I must confer at once with Arbaces.  We will frustrateyou, my friends, deep as you think yourselves.  At present, my breast isa locked treasury of your secret.\'Thus muttering, Calenus, for it was he, wrapped his robe round him, andstrode thoughtfully homeward.Chapter IIA CLASSIC HOST, COOK, AND KITCHEN.  APAECIDES SEEKS IONE.  THEIRCONVERSATION.IT was then the day for Diomed\'s banquet to the most select of hisfriends. The graceful Glaucus, the beautiful Ione, the official Pansa,the high-born Clodius, the immortal Fulvius, the exquisite Lepidus, theepicurean Sallust, were not the only honourers of his festival.  Heexpected, also, an invalid senator from Rome (a man of considerablerepute and favor at court), and a great warrior from Herculaneum, whohad fought with Titus against the Jews, and having enriched himselfprodigiously in the wars, was always told by his friends that hiscountry was eternally indebted to his disinterested exertions!  Theparty, however, extended to a yet greater number: for although,critically speaking, it was, at one time, thought inelegant among theRomans to entertain less than three or more than nine at their banquets,yet this rule was easily disregarded by the ostentatious. And we aretold, indeed, in history, that one of the most splendid of theseentertainers usually feasted a select party of three hundred. Diomed,however, more modest, contented himself with doubling the number of theMuses.  His party consisted of eighteen, no unfashionable number in thepresent day.It was the morning of Diomed\'s banquet; and Diomed himself, though hegreatly affected the gentleman and the scholar, retained enough of hismercantile experience to know that a master\'s eye makes a ready servant.Accordingly, with his tunic ungirdled on his portly stomach, his easyslippers on his feet, a small wand in his hand, wherewith he nowdirected the gaze, and now corrected the back, of some duller menial, hewent from chamber to chamber of his costly villa.He did not disdain even a visit to that sacred apartment in which thepriests of the festival prepare their offerings.  On entering thekitchen, his ears were agreeably stunned by the noise of dishes andpans, of oaths and commands.  Small as this indispensable chamber seemsto have been in all the houses of Pompeii, it was, nevertheless, usuallyfitted up with all that amazing variety of stoves and shapes, stew-pansand saucepans, cutters and moulds, without which a cook of spirit, nomatter whether he be an ancient or a modern, declares it utterlyimpossible that he can give you anything to eat. And as fuel was then,as now, dear and scarce in those regions, great seems to have been thedexterity exercised in preparing as many things as possible with aslittle fire.  An admirable contrivance of this nature may be still seenin the Neapolitan Museum, viz., a portable kitchen, about the size of afolio volume, containing stoves for four dishes, and an apparatus forheating water or other beverages.Across the small kitchen flitted many forms which the quick eye of themaster did not recognize.\'Oh! oh!\' grumbled he to himself, \'that cursed Congrio hath invited awhole legion of cooks to assist him.  They won\'t serve for nothing, andthis is another item in the total of my day\'s expenses. By Bacchus!thrice lucky shall I be if the slaves do not help themselves to some ofthe drinking vessels: ready, alas, are their hands, capacious are theirtunics.  Me miserum!\'The cooks, however, worked on, seemingly heedless of the apparition ofDiomed.\'Ho, Euclio, your egg-pan!  What, is this the largest? it only holdsthirty-three eggs: in the houses I usually serve, the smallest egg-panholds fifty, if need be!\'\'The unconscionable rogue!\' thought Diomed; \'he talks of eggs as if theywere a sesterce a hundred!\'\'By Mercury!\' cried a pert little culinary disciple, scarce in hisnovitiate; \'whoever saw such antique sweetmeat shapes as these?--It isimpossible to do credit to one\'s art with such rude materials.  Why,Sallust\'s commonest sweetmeat shape represents the whole siege of Troy;Hector and Paris, and Helen...  with little Astyanax and the WoodenHorse into the bargain!\'\'Silence, fool!\' said Congrio, the cook of the house, who seemed toleave the chief part of the battle to his allies.  \'My master, Diomed,is not one of those expensive good-for-noughts, who must have the lastfashion, cost what it will!\'\'Thou liest, base slave!\' cried Diomed, in a great passion--and thoucostest me already enough to have ruined Lucullus himself!  Come out ofthy den, I want to talk to thee.\'The slave, with a sly wink at his confederates, obeyed the command.\'Man of three letters,\' said Diomed, with his face of solemn anger, \'howdidst thou dare to invite all those rascals into my house?--I see thiefwritten in every line of their faces.\'\'Yet, I assure you, master, that they are men of most respectablecharacter--the best cooks of the place; it is a great favor to get them.But for my sake...\'\'Thy sake, unhappy Congrio!\' interrupted Diomed; and by what purloinedmoneys of mine, by what reserved filchings from marketing, by whatgoodly meats converted into grease, and sold in the suburbs, by whatfalse charges for bronzes marred, and earthenware broken--hast thou beenenabled to make them serve thee for thy sake?\'\'Nay, master, do not impeach my honesty!  May the gods desert me if...\'\'Swear not!\' again interrupted the choleric Diomed, \'for then the godswill smite thee for a perjurer, and I shall lose my cook on the eve ofdinner. But, enough of this at present: keep a sharp eye on thyill-favored assistants, and tell me no tales to-morrow of vases broken,and cups miraculously vanished, or thy whole back shall be one pain.And hark thee! thou knowest thou hast made me pay for those Phrygianattagens enough, by Hercules, to have feasted a sober man for a yeartogether--see that they be not one iota over-roasted.  The last time, OCongrio, that I gave a banquet to my friends, when thy vanity did soboldly undertake the becoming appearance of a Melian crane--thou knowestit came up like a stone from AEtna--as if all the fires of Phlegethonhad been scorching out its juices. Be modest this time, Congrio--waryand modest.  Modesty is the nurse of great actions; and in all otherthings, as in this, if thou wilt not spare thy master\'s purse, at leastconsult thy master\'s glory.\'\'There shall not be such a coena seen at Pompeii since the days ofHercules.\'\'Softly, softly--thy cursed boasting again!  But I say, Congrio, yonhomunculus--yon pigmy assailant of my cranes--yon pert-tongued neophyteof the kitchen, was there aught but insolence on his tongue when hemaligned the comeliness of my sweetmeat shapes?  I would not be out ofthe fashion, Congrio.\'\'It is but the custom of us cooks,\' replied Congrio, gravely, toundervalue our tools, in order to increase the effect of our art. Thesweetmeat shape is a fair shape, and a lovely; but I would recommend mymaster, at the first occasion, to purchase some new ones of a...\'\'That will suffice,\' exclaimed Diomed, who seemed resolved never toallow his slave to finish his sentences.  \'Now, resume thycharge--shine----eclipse thyself.  Let men envy Diomed his cook--let theslaves of Pompeii style thee Congrio the great!  Go! yet stay--thou hastnot spent all the moneys I gave thee for the marketing?\'\'""All!"" alas! the nightingales\' tongues and the Roman tomacula, and theoysters from Britain, and sundry other things, too numerous now torecite, are yet left unpaid for.  But what matter? every one trusts theArchimagirus of Diomed the wealthy!\'\'Oh, unconscionable prodigal!--what waste!--what profusion!--I amruined! But go, hasten--inspect!--taste!--perform!--surpass thyself!Let the Roman senator not despise the poor Pompeian.  Away, slave--andremember, the Phrygian attagens.\'The chief disappeared within his natural domain, and Diomed rolled backhis portly presence to the more courtly chambers.  All was to hisliking--the flowers were fresh, the fountains played briskly, the mosaicpavements were as smooth as mirrors.\'Where is my daughter Julia?\' he asked.\'At the bath.\'\'Ah! that reminds me!--time wanes!--and I must bathe also.\'Our story returns to Apaecides.  On awaking that day from the broken andfeverish sleep which had followed his adoption of a faith so strikinglyand sternly at variance with that in which his youth had been nurtured,the young priest could scarcely imagine that he was not yet in a dream;he had crossed the fatal river--the past was henceforth to have nosympathy with the future; the two worlds were distinct andseparate--that which had been, from that which was to be. To what a boldand adventurous enterprise he had pledged his life!--to unveil themysteries in which he had participated--to desecrate the altars he hadserved--to denounce the goddess whose ministering robe he wore!  Slowlyhe became sensible of the hatred and the horror he should provokeamongst the pious, even if successful; if frustrated in his daringattempt, what penalties might he not incur for an offence hithertounheard of--for which no specific law, derived from experience, wasprepared; and which, for that very reason, precedents, dragged from thesharpest armoury of obsolete and inapplicable legislation, wouldprobably be distorted to meet!  His friends--the sister of hisyouth--could he expect justice, though he might receive compassion, fromthem? This brave and heroic act would by their heathen eyes be regarded,perhaps, as a heinous apostasy--at the best as a pitiable madness.He dared, he renounced, everything in this world, in the hope ofsecuring that eternity in the next, which had so suddenly been revealedto him. While these thoughts on the one hand invaded his breast, on theother hand his pride, his courage, and his virtue, mingled withreminiscences of revenge for deceit, of indignant disgust at fraud,conspired to raise and to support him.The conflict was sharp and keen; but his new feelings triumphed over hisold: and a mighty argument in favor of wrestling with the sanctities ofold opinions and hereditary forms might be found in the conquest overboth, achieved by that humble priest.  Had the early Christians beenmore controlled by \'the solemn plausibilities of custom\'--less ofdemocrats in the pure and lofty acceptation of that pervertedword--Christianity would have perished in its cradle!As each priest in succession slept several nights together in thechambers of the temple, the term imposed on Apaecides was not yetcompleted; and when he had risen from his couch, attired himself, asusual, in his robes, and left his narrow chamber, he found himselfbefore the altars of the temple.In the exhaustion of his late emotions he had slept far into themorning, and the vertical sun already poured its fervid beams over thesacred place.\'Salve, Apaecides!\' said a voice, whose natural asperity was smoothed bylong artifice into an almost displeasing softness of tone. \'Thou artlate abroad; has the goddess revealed herself to thee in visions?\'\'Could she reveal her true self to the people, Calenus, how incenselesswould be these altars!\'\'That,\' replied Calenus, \'may possibly be true; but the deity is wiseenough to hold commune with none but priests.\'\'A time may come when she will be unveiled without her ownacquiescence.\'\'It is not likely: she has triumphed for countless ages.  And that whichhas so long stood the test of time rarely succumbs to the lust ofnovelty.  But hark ye, young brother! these sayings are indiscreet.\'\'It is not for thee to silence them,\' replied Apaecides, haughtily.\'So hot!--yet I will not quarrel with thee.  Why, my Apaecides, has notthe Egyptian convinced thee of the necessity of our dwelling together inunity? Has he not convinced thee of the wisdom of deluding the peopleand enjoying ourselves?  If not, oh, brother! he is not that greatmagician he is esteemed.\'\'Thou, then, hast shared his lessons?\' said Apaecides, with a hollowsmile.\'Ay! but I stood less in need of them than thou.  Nature had alreadygifted me with the love of pleasure, and the desire of gain and power.Long is the way that leads the voluptuary to the severities of life; butit is only one step from pleasant sin to sheltering hypocrisy.  Bewarethe vengeance of the goddess, if the shortness of that step bedisclosed!\'\'Beware, thou, the hour when the tomb shall be rent and the rottennessexposed,\' returned Apaecides, solemnly.  \'Vale!\'With these words he left the flamen to his meditations.  When he got afew paces from the temple, he turned to look back.  Calenus had alreadydisappeared in the entry room of the priests, for it now approached thehour of that repast which, called prandium by the ancients, answers inpoint of date to the breakfast of the moderns. The white and gracefulfane gleamed brightly in the sun.  Upon the altars before it rose theincense and bloomed the garlands.  The priest gazed long and wistfullyupon the scene--it was the last time that it was ever beheld by him!He then turned and pursued his way slowly towards the house of Ione; forbefore possibly the last tie that united them was cut in twain--beforethe uncertain peril of the next day was incurred, he was anxious to seehis last surviving relative, his fondest as his earliest friend.He arrived at her house, and found her in the garden with Nydia.\'This is kind, Apaecides,\' said Ione, joyfully; \'and how eagerly have Iwished to see thee!--what thanks do I not owe thee?  How churlish hastthou been to answer none of my letters--to abstain from coming hither toreceive the expressions of my gratitude!  Oh! thou hast assisted topreserve thy sister from dishonour!  What, what can she say to thankthee, now thou art come at last?\'\'My sweet Ione, thou owest me no gratitude, for thy cause was mine.  Letus avoid that subject, let us recur not to that impious man--how hatefulto both of us!  I may have a speedy opportunity to teach the world thenature of his pretended wisdom and hypocritical severity.  But let ussit down, my sister; I am wearied with the heat of the sun; let us sitin yonder shade, and, for a little while longer, be to each other whatwe have been.\'Beneath a wide plane-tree, with the cistus and the arbutus clusteringround them, the living fountain before, the greensward beneath theirfeet; the gay cicada, once so dear to Athens, rising merrily ever andanon amidst the grass; the butterfly, beautiful emblem of the soul,dedicated to Psyche, and which has continued to furnish illustrations tothe Christian bard, rich in the glowing colors caught from Sicilianskies, hovering about the sunny flowers, itself like a winged flower--inthis spot, and this scene, the brother and the sister sat together forthe last time on earth. You may tread now on the same place; but thegarden is no more, the columns are shattered, the fountain has ceased toplay.  Let the traveler search amongst the ruins of Pompeii for thehouse of Ione. Its remains are yet visible; but I will not betray themto the gaze of commonplace tourists.  He who is more sensitive than theherd will discover them easily: when he has done so, let him keep thesecret.They sat down, and Nydia, glad to be alone, retired to the farther endof the garden.\'Ione, my sister,\' said the young convert, \'place your hand upon mybrow; let me feel your cool touch.  Speak to me, too, for your gentlevoice is like a breeze that hath freshness as well as music. Speak tome, but forbear to bless me!  Utter not one word of those forms ofspeech which our childhood was taught to consider sacred!\'\'Alas! and what then shall I say?  Our language of affection is so wovenwith that of worship, that the words grow chilled and trite if I banishfrom them allusion to our gods.\'\'Our gods!\' murmured Apaecides, with a shudder: \'thou slightest myrequest already.\'\'Shall I speak then to thee only of Isis?\'\'The Evil Spirit!  No, rather be dumb for ever, unless at least thoucanst--but away, away this talk!  Not now will we dispute and cavil; notnow will we judge harshly of each other.  Thou, regarding me as anapostate! and I all sorrow and shame for thee as an idolater. No, mysister, let us avoid such topics and such thoughts.  In thy sweetpresence a calm falls over my spirit.  For a little while I forget.  AsI thus lay my temples on thy bosom, as I thus feel thy gentle armembrace me, I think that we are children once more, and that the heavensmiles equally upon both.  For oh! if hereafter I escape, no matter whatperil; and it be permitted me to address thee on one sacred and awfulsubject; should I find thine ear closed and thy heart hardened, whathope for myself could countervail the despair for thee?  In thee, mysister, I behold a likeness made beautiful, made noble, of myself.Shall the mirror live for ever, and the form itself be broken as thepotter\'s clay?  Ah, no--no--thou wilt listen to me yet!  Dost thouremember how we went into the fields by Baiae, hand in hand together, topluck the flowers of spring?  Even so, hand in hand, shall we enter theEternal Garden, and crown ourselves with imperishable asphodel!\'Wondering and bewildered by words she could not comprehend, but excitedeven to tears by the plaintiveness of their tone, Ione listened to theseoutpourings of a full and oppressed heart.  In truth, Apaecides himselfwas softened much beyond his ordinary mood, which to outward seeming wasusually either sullen or impetuous.  For the noblest desires are of ajealous nature--they engross, they absorb the soul, and often leave thesplenetic humors stagnant and unheeded at the surface.  Unheeding thepetty things around us, we are deemed morose; impatient at earthlyinterruption to the diviner dreams, we are thought irritable andchurlish.  For as there is no chimera vainer than the hope that onehuman heart shall find sympathy in another, so none ever interpret uswith justice; and none, no, not our nearest and our dearest ties,forbear with us in mercy!  When we are dead and repentance comes toolate, both friend and foe may wonder to think how little there was in usto forgive!\'I will talk to thee then of our early years,\' said Ione.  \'Shall yonblind girl sing to thee of the days of childhood?  Her voice is sweetand musical, and she hath a song on that theme which contains none ofthose allusions it pains thee to hear.\'\'Dost thou remember the words, my sister?\' asked Apaecides.\'Methinks yes; for the tune, which is simple, fixed them on my memory.\'\'Sing to me then thyself.  My ear is not in unison with unfamiliarvoices; and thine, Ione, full of household associations, has ever beento me more sweet than all the hireling melodies of Lycia or of Crete.Sing to me!\'Ione beckoned to a slave that stood in the portico, and sending for herlute, sang, when it arrived, to a tender and simple air, the followingverses:--              REGRETS FOR CHILDHOOD                    I         It is not that our earlier Heaven              Escapes its April showers,          Or that to childhood\'s heart is given              No snake amidst the flowers.                 Ah! twined with grief                 Each brightest leaf,              That\'s wreath\'d us by the Hours!          Young though we be, the Past may sting,              The present feed its sorrow;          But hope shines bright on every thing              That waits us with the morrow.                 Like sun-lit glades,                 The dimmest shades              Some rosy beam can borrow.                    II         It is not that our later years              Of cares are woven wholly,          But smiles less swiftly chase the tears,              And wounds are healed more slowly.                 And Memory\'s vow                 To lost ones now,              Makes joys too bright, unholy.          And ever fled the Iris bow              That smiled when clouds were o\'er us.          If storms should burst, uncheered we go,              A drearier waste before us--                And with the toys                 Of childish joys,              We\'ve broke the staff that bore us!Wisely and delicately had Ione chosen that song, sad though its burthenseemed; for when we are deeply mournful, discordant above all others isthe voice of mirth: the fittest spell is that borrowed from melancholyitself, for dark thoughts can be softened down when they cannot bebrightened; and so they lose the precise and rigid outline of theirtruth, and their colors melt into the ideal.  As the leech applies inremedy to the internal sore some outward irritation, which, by a gentlerwound, draws away the venom of that which is more deadly, thus, in therankling festers of the mind, our art is to divert to a milder sadnesson the surface the pain that gnaweth at the core.  And so withApaecides, yielding to the influence of the silver voice that remindedhim of the past, and told but of half the sorrow born to the present, heforgot his more immediate and fiery sources of anxious thought.  Hespent hours in making Ione alternately sing to, and converse with him;and when he rose to leave her, it was with a calmed and lulled mind.\'Ione,\' said he, as he pressed her hand, \'should you hear my nameblackened and maligned, will you credit the aspersion?\'\'Never, my brother, never!\'\'Dost thou not imagine, according to thy belief, that the evil-doer ispunished hereafter, and the good rewarded?\'\'Can you doubt it?\'\'Dost thou think, then, that he who is truly good should sacrifice everyselfish interest in his zeal for virtue?\'\'He who doth so is the equal of the gods.\'\'And thou believest that, according to the purity and courage with whichhe thus acts, shall be his portion of bliss beyond the grave?\'\'So we are taught to hope.\'\'Kiss me, my sister.  One question more.  Thou art to be wedded toGlaucus: perchance that marriage may separate us more hopelessly--butnot of this speak I now--thou art to be married to Glaucus--dost thoulove him?  Nay, my sister, answer me by words.\'\'Yes!\' murmured Ione, blushing.\'Dost thou feel that, for his sake, thou couldst renounce pride, bravedishonour, and incur death?  I have heard that when women really love,it is to that excess.\'\'My brother, all this could I do for Glaucus, and feel that it were nota sacrifice.  There is no sacrifice to those who love, in what is bornefor the one we love.\'\'Enough! shall woman feel thus for man, and man feel less devotion tohis God?\'He spoke no more.  His whole countenance seemed instinct and inspiredwith a divine life: his chest swelled proudly; his eyes glowed: on hisforehead was writ the majesty of a man who can dare to be noble!  Heturned to meet the eyes of Ione--earnest, wistful, fearful--he kissedher fondly, strained her warmly to his breast, and in a moment more hehad left the house.Long did Ione remain in the same place, mute and thoughtful.  Themaidens again and again came to warn her of the deepening noon, and herengagement to Diomed\'s banquet.  At length she woke from her reverie,and prepared, not with the pride of beauty, but listless and melancholy,for the festival: one thought alone reconciled her to the promisedvisit--she should meet Glaucus--she could confide to him her alarm anduneasiness for her brother.Chapter IIIA FASHIONABLE PARTY AND A DINNER A LA MODE IN POMPEII.MEANWHILE Sallust and Glaucus were slowly strolling towards the house ofDiomed.  Despite the habits of his life, Sallust was not devoid of manyestimable qualities.  He would have been an active friend, a usefulcitizen--in short, an excellent man, if he had not taken it into hishead to be a philosopher.  Brought up in the schools in which Romanplagiarism worshipped the echo of Grecian wisdom, he had imbued himselfwith those doctrines by which the later Epicureans corrupted the simplemaxims of their great master.  He gave himself altogether up topleasure, and imagined there was no sage like a boon companion.  Still,however, he had a considerable degree of learning, wit, and good nature;and the hearty frankness of his very vices seemed like virtue itselfbeside the utter corruption of Clodius and the prostrate effeminacy ofLepidus; and therefore Glaucus liked him the best of his companions; andhe, in turn, appreciating the nobler qualities of the Athenian, lovedhim almost as much as a cold muraena, or a bowl of the best Falernian.\'This is a vulgar old fellow, this Diomed,\' said Sallust: \'but he hassome good qualities--in his cellar!\'\'And some charming ones--in his daughter.\'\'True, Glaucus: but you are not much moved by them, methinks.  I fancyClodius is desirous to be your successor.\'\'He is welcome.  At the banquet of Julia\'s beauty, no guest, be sure, isconsidered a musca.\'\'You are severe: but she has, indeed, something of the Corinthian abouther--they will be well matched, after all!  What good-natured fellows weare to associate with that gambling good-for-nought.\'\'Pleasure unites strange varieties,\' answered Glaucus.  \'He amusesme...\'\'And flatters--but then he pays himself well!  He powders his praisewith gold-dust.\'\'You often hint that he plays unfairly--think you so really?\'\'My dear Glaucus, a Roman noble has his dignity to keep up--dignity isvery expensive--Clodius must cheat like a scoundrel, in order to livelike a gentleman.\'\'Ha ha!--well, of late I have renounced the dice.  Ah! Sallust, when Iam wedded to Ione, I trust I may yet redeem a youth of follies. We areboth born for better things than those in which we sympathize now--bornto render our worship in nobler temples than the stye of Epicurus.\'\'Alas!\' returned Sallust, in rather a melancholy tone, \'what do we knowmore than this--life is short--beyond the grave all is dark? There is nowisdom like that which says ""enjoy"".\'\'By Bacchus!  I doubt sometimes if we do enjoy the utmost of which lifeis capable.\'\'I am a moderate man,\' returned Sallust, \'and do not ask ""the utmost"".We are like malefactors, and intoxicate ourselves with wine and myrrh,as we stand on the brink of death; but, if we did not do so, the abysswould look very disagreeable.  I own that I was inclined to be gloomyuntil I took so heartily to drinking--that is a new life, my Glaucus.\'\'Yes! but it brings us next morning to a new death.\'\'Why, the next morning is unpleasant, I own; but, then, if it were notso, one would never be inclined to read.  I study betimes--because, bythe gods! I am generally unfit for anything else till noon.\'\'Fie, Scythian!\'\'Pshaw! the fate of Pentheus to him who denies Bacchus.\'\'Well, Sallust, with all your faults, you are the best profligate I evermet: and verily, if I were in danger of life, you are the only man inall Italy who would stretch out a finger to save me.\'\'Perhaps I should not, if it were in the middle of supper.  But, intruth, we Italians are fearfully selfish.\'\'So are all men who are not free,\' said Glaucus, with a sigh. \'Freedomalone makes men sacrifice to each other.\'\'Freedom, then, must be a very fatiguing thing to an Epicurean,\'answered Sallust.  \'But here we are at our host\'s.\'As Diomed\'s villa is one of the most considerable in point of size ofany yet discovered at Pompeii, and is, moreover, built much according tothe specific instructions for a suburban villa laid down by the Romanarchitect, it may not be uninteresting briefly to describe the plan ofthe apartments through which our visitors passed.They entered, then, by the same small vestibule at which we have beforebeen presented to the aged Medon, and passed at once into a colonnade,technically termed the peristyle; for the main difference between thesuburban villa and the town mansion consisted in placing, in the first,the said colonnade in exactly the same place as that which in the townmansion was occupied by the atrium.  In the centre of the peristyle wasan open court, which contained the impluvium.From this peristyle descended a staircase to the offices; another narrowpassage on the opposite side communicated with a garden; various smallapartments surrounded the colonnade, appropriated probably to countryvisitors.  Another door to the left on entering communicated with asmall triangular portico, which belonged to the baths; and behind wasthe wardrobe, in which were kept the vests of the holiday suits of theslaves, and, perhaps, of the master.  Seventeen centuries afterwardswere found those relics of ancient finery calcined and crumbling: keptlonger, alas! than their thrifty lord foresaw.Return we to the peristyle, and endeavor now to present to the reader acoup d\'oeil of the whole suite of apartments, which immediatelystretched before the steps of the visitors.Let him then first imagine the columns of the portico, hung withfestoons of flowers; the columns themselves in the lower part paintedred, and the walls around glowing with various frescoes; then, lookingbeyond a curtain, three parts drawn aside, the eye caught the tablinumor saloon (which was closed at will by glazed doors, now slid back intothe walls).  On either side of this tablinum were small rooms, one ofwhich was a kind of cabinet of gems; and these apartments, as well asthe tablinum, communicated with a long gallery, which opened at eitherend upon terraces; and between the terraces, and communicating with thecentral part of the gallery, was a hall, in which the banquet was thatday prepared.  All these apartments, though almost on a level with thestreet, were one story above the garden; and the terraces communicatingwith the gallery were continued into corridors, raised above the pillarswhich, to the right and left, skirted the garden below.Beneath, and on a level with the garden, ran the apartments we havealready described as chiefly appropriated to Julia.In the gallery, then, just mentioned, Diomed received his guests.The merchant affected greatly the man of letters, and, therefore, healso affected a passion for everything Greek; he paid particularattention to Glaucus.\'You will see, my friend,\' said he, with a wave of his hand, \'that I ama little classical here--a little Cecropian--eh?  The hall in which weshall sup is borrowed from the Greeks.  It is an OEcus Cyzicene.  NobleSallust, they have not, I am told, this sort of apartment in Rome.\'\'Oh!\' replied Sallust, with a half smile; \'you Pompeians combine allthat is most eligible in Greece and in Rome; may you, Diomed, combinethe viands as well as the architecture!\'\'You shall see--you shall see, my Sallust,\' replied the merchant.  \'Wehave a taste at Pompeii, and we have also money.\'\'They are two excellent things,\' replied Sallust.  \'But, behold, thelady Julia!\'The main difference, as I have before remarked, in the manner of lifeobserved among the Athenians and Romans, was, that with the first, themodest women rarely or never took part in entertainments; with thelatter, they were the common ornaments of the banquet; but when theywere present at the feast, it usually terminated at an early hour.Magnificently robed in white, interwoven with pearls and threads ofgold, the handsome Julia entered the apartment.Scarcely had she received the salutation of the two guests, ere Pansaand his wife, Lepidus, Clodius, and the Roman senator, entered almostsimultaneously; then came the widow Fulvia; then the poet Fulvius, liketo the widow in name if in nothing else; the warrior from Herculaneum,accompanied by his umbra, next stalked in; afterwards, the less eminentof the guests.  Ione yet tarried.It was the mode among the courteous ancients to flatter whenever it wasin their power: accordingly it was a sign of ill-breeding to seatthemselves immediately on entering the house of their host.  Afterperforming the salutation, which was usually accomplished by the samecordial shake of the right hand which we ourselves retain, andsometimes, by the yet more familiar embrace, they spent several minutesin surveying the apartment, and admiring the bronzes, the pictures, orthe furniture, with which it was adorned--a mode very impolite accordingto our refined English notions, which place good breeding inindifference.  We would not for the world express much admiration ofanother man\'s house, for fear it should be thought we had never seenanything so fine before!\'A beautiful statue this of Bacchus!\' said the Roman senator.\'A mere trifle!\' replied Diomed.\'What charming paintings!\' said Fulvia.\'Mere trifles!\' answered the owner.\'Exquisite candelabra!\' cried the warrior.\'Exquisite!\' echoed his umbra.\'Trifles! trifles!\' reiterated the merchant.Meanwhile, Glaucus found himself by one of the windows of the gallery,which communicated with the terraces, and the fair Julia by his side.\'Is it an Athenian virtue, Glaucus,\' said the merchant\'s daughter, \'toshun those whom we once sought?\'\'Fair Julia--no!\'\'Yet methinks, it is one of the qualities of Glaucus.\'\'Glaucus never shuns a friend!\' replied the Greek, with some emphasis onthe last word.\'May Julia rank among the number of his friends?\'\'It would be an honour to the emperor to find a friend in one solovely.\'\'You evade my question,\' returned the enamoured Julia.  \'But tell me, isit true that you admire the Neapolitan Ione?\'\'Does not beauty constrain our admiration?\'\'Ah! subtle Greek, still do you fly the meaning of my words.  But say,shall Julia be indeed your friend?\'\'If she will so favor me, blessed be the gods!  The day in which I amthus honored shall be ever marked in white.\'\'Yet, even while you speak, your eye is resting--your color comes andgoes--you move away involuntarily--you are impatient to join Ione!\'For at that moment Ione had entered, and Glaucus had indeed betrayed theemotion noticed by the jealous beauty.\'Can admiration to one woman make me unworthy the friendship of another?Sanction not so, O Julia the libels of the poets on your sex!\'\'Well, you are right--or I will learn to think so.  Glaucus, yet onemoment! You are to wed Ione; is it not so?\'\'If the Fates permit, such is my blessed hope.\'\'Accept, then, from me, in token of our new friendship, a present foryour bride.  Nay, it is the custom of friends, you know, always topresent to bride and bridegroom some such little marks of their esteemand favoring wishes.\'\'Julia! I cannot refuse any token of friendship from one like you. Iwill accept the gift as an omen from Fortune herself.\'\'Then, after the feast, when the guests retire, you will descend with meto my apartment, and receive it from my hands.  Remember!\' said Julia,as she joined the wife of Pansa, and left Glaucus to seek Ione.The widow Fulvia and the spouse of the aedile were engaged in high andgrave discussion.\'O Fulvia! I assure you that the last account from Rome declares thatthe frizzling mode of dressing the hair is growing antiquated; they onlynow wear it built up in a tower, like Julia\'s, or arranged as ahelmet--the Galerian fashion, like mine, you see: it has a fine effect,I think. I assure you, Vespius (Vespius was the name of the Herculaneumhero) admires it greatly.\'\'And nobody wears the hair like yon Neapolitan, in the Greek way.\'\'What, parted in front, with the knot behind?  Oh, no; how ridiculous itis! it reminds one of the statue of Diana!  Yet this Ione is handsome,eh?\'\'So the men say; but then she is rich: she is to marry the Athenian--Iwish her joy.  He will not be long faithful, I suspect; those foreignersare very faithless.\'\'Oh, Julia!\' said Fulvia, as the merchant\'s daughter joined them; \'haveyou seen the tiger yet?\'\'No!\'\'Why, all the ladies have been to see him.  He is so handsome!\'\'I hope we shall find some criminal or other for him and the lion,\'replied Julia.  \'Your husband (turning to Pansa\'s wife) is not so activeas he should be in this matter.\'\'Why, really, the laws are too mild,\' replied the dame of the helmet.\'There are so few offences to which the punishment of the arena can beawarded; and then, too, the gladiators are growing effeminate!  Thestoutest bestiarii declare they are willing enough to fight a boar or abull; but as for a lion or a tiger, they think the game too much inearnest.\'\'They are worthy of a mitre,\' replied Julia, in disdain.\'Oh! have you seen the new house of Fulvius, the dear poet?\' saidPansa\'s wife.\'No: is it handsome?\'\'Very!--such good taste.  But they say, my dear, that he has suchimproper pictures!  He won\'t show them to the women: how ill-bred!\'\'Those poets are always odd,\' said the widow.  \'But he is an interestingman; what pretty verses he writes!  We improve very much in poetry: itis impossible to read the old stuff now.\'\'I declare I am of your opinion, returned the lady of the helmet.\'There is so much more force and energy in the modern school.\'The warrior sauntered up to the ladies.\'It reconciles me to peace,\' said he, \'when I see such faces.\'\'Oh!  you heroes are ever flatterers,\' returned Fulvia, hastening toappropriate the compliment specially to herself.\'By this chain, which I received from the emperor\'s own hand,\' repliedthe warrior, playing with a short chain which hung round the neck like acollar, instead of descending to the breast, according to the fashion ofthe peaceful--\'By this chain, you wrong me!  I am a blunt man--a soldiershould be so.\'\'How do you find the ladies of Pompeii generally?\' said Julia.\'By Venus, most beautiful!  They favor me a little, it is true, and thatinclines my eyes to double their charms.\'\'We love a warrior,\' said the wife of Pansa.\'I see it: by Hercules! it is even disagreeable to be too celebrated inthese cities.  At Herculaneum they climb the roof of my atrium to catcha glimpse of me through the compluvium; the admiration of one\'s citizensis pleasant at first, but burthensome afterwards.\'\'True, true, O Vespius!\' cried the poet, joining the group: \'I find itso myself.\'\'You!\' said the stately warrior, scanning the small form of the poetwith ineffable disdain.  \'In what legion have you served?\'\'You may see my spoils, my exuviae, in the forum itself,\' returned thepoet, with a significant glance at the women.  \'I have been among thetent-companions, the contubernales, of the great Mantuan himself.\'\'I know no general from Mantua, said the warrior, gravely.  \'Whatcampaign have you served?\'\'That of Helicon.\'\'I never heard of it.\'\'Nay, Vespius, he does but joke,\' said Julia, laughing.\'Joke!  By Mars, am I a man to be joked!\'\'Yes; Mars himself was in love with the mother of jokes,\' said the poet,a little alarmed.  \'Know, then, O Vespius! that I am the poet Fulvius.It is I who make warriors immortal!\'\'The gods forbid!\' whispered Sallust to Julia.  \'If Vespius were madeimmortal, what a specimen of tiresome braggadocio would be transmittedto posterity!\'The soldier looked puzzled; when, to the infinite relief of himself andhis companions, the signal for the feast was given.As we have already witnessed at the house of Glaucus the ordinaryroutine of a Pompeian entertainment, the reader is spared any seconddetail of the courses, and the manner in which they were introduced.Diomed, who was rather ceremonious, had appointed a nomenclator, orappointer of places to each guest.The reader understands that the festive board was composed of threetables; one at the centre, and one at each wing.  It was only at theouter side of these tables that the guests reclined; the inner space wasleft untenanted, for the greater convenience of the waiters or ministri.The extreme corner of one of the wings was appropriated to Julia as thelady of the feast; that next her, to Diomed.  At one corner of thecentre table was placed the aedile; at the opposite corner, the Romansenator--these were the posts of honour.  The other guests werearranged, so that the young (gentleman or lady) should sit next eachother, and the more advanced in years be similarly matched.  Anagreeable provision enough, but one which must often have offended thosewho wished to be thought still young.The chair of Ione was next to the couch of Glaucus.  The seats wereveneered with tortoiseshell, and covered with quilts stuffed withfeathers, and ornamented with costly embroideries.  The modern ornamentsof epergne or plateau were supplied by images of the gods, wrought inbronze, ivory, and silver.  The sacred salt-cellar and the familiarLares were not forgotten. Over the table and the seats a rich canopy wassuspended from the ceiling. At each corner of the table were loftycandelabra--for though it was early noon, the room was darkened--whilefrom tripods, placed in different parts of the room, distilled the odorof myrrh and frankincense; and upon the abacus, or sideboard, largevases and various ornaments of silver were ranged, much with the sameostentation (but with more than the same taste) that we find displayedat a modern feast.The custom of grace was invariably supplied by that of libations to thegods; and Vesta, as queen of the household gods, usually received firstthat graceful homage.This ceremony being performed, the slaves showered flowers upon thecouches and the floor, and crowned each guest with rosy garlands,intricately woven with ribands, tied by the rind of the linden-tree, andeach intermingled with the ivy and the amethyst--supposed preventivesagainst the effect of wine; the wreaths of the women only were exemptedfrom these leaves, for it was not the fashion for them to drink wine inpublic.  It was then that the president Diomed thought it advisable toinstitute a basileus, or director of the feast--an important office,sometimes chosen by lot; sometimes, as now, by the master of theentertainment.Diomed was not a little puzzled as to his election.  The invalid senatorwas too grave and too infirm for the proper fulfilment of his duty; theaedile Pansa was adequate enough to the task: but then, to choose thenext in official rank to the senator, was an affront to the senatorhimself.  While deliberating between the merits of the others, he caughtthe mirthful glance of Sallust, and, by a sudden inspiration, named thejovial epicure to the rank of director, or arbiter bibendi.Sallust received the appointment with becoming humility.\'I shall be a merciful king,\' said he, \'to those who drink deep; to arecusant, Minos himself shall be less inexorable.  Beware!\'The slaves handed round basins of perfumed water, by which lavation thefeast commenced: and now the table groaned under the initiatory course.The conversation, at first desultory and scattered, allowed Ione andGlaucus to carry on those sweet whispers, which are worth all theeloquence in the world.  Julia watched them with flashing eyes.\'How soon shall her place be mine!\' thought she.But Clodius, who sat in the centre table, so as to observe well thecountenance of Julia, guessed her pique, and resolved to profit by it.He addressed her across the table in set phrases of gallantry; and as hewas of high birth and of a showy person, the vain Julia was not so muchin love as to be insensible to his attentions.The slaves, in the interim, were constantly kept upon the alert by thevigilant Sallust, who chased one cup by another with a celerity whichseemed as if he were resolved upon exhausting those capacious cellarswhich the reader may yet see beneath the house of Diomed. The worthymerchant began to repent his choice, as amphora after amphora waspierced and emptied.  The slaves, all under the age of manhood (theyoungest being about ten years old--it was they who filled the wine--theeldest, some five years older, mingled it with water), seemed to sharein the zeal of Sallust; and the face of Diomed began to glow as hewatched the provoking complacency with which they seconded the exertionsof the king of the feast.\'Pardon me, O senator!\' said Sallust; \'I see you flinch; your purple hemcannot save you--drink!\'\'By the gods,\' said the senator, coughing, \'my lungs are already onfire; you proceed with so miraculous a swiftness, that Phaeton himselfwas nothing to you.  I am infirm, O pleasant Sallust: you must exonerateme.\'\'Not I, by Vesta!  I am an impartial monarch--drink.\'The poor senator, compelled by the laws of the table, was forced tocomply. Alas! every cup was bringing him nearer and nearer to theStygian pool.\'Gently! gently! my king,\' groaned Diomed; \'we already begin to...\'\'Treason!\' interrupted Sallust; \'no stern Brutus here!--no interferencewith royalty!\'\'But our female guests...\'\'Love a toper!  Did not Ariadne dote upon Bacchus?\'The feast proceeded; the guests grew more talkative and noisy; thedessert or last course was already on the table; and the slaves boreround water with myrrh and hyssop for the finishing lavation.  At thesame time, a small circular table that had been placed in the spaceopposite the guests suddenly, and as by magic, seemed to open in thecentre, and cast up a fragrant shower, sprinkling the table and theguests; while as it ceased the awning above them was drawn aside, andthe guests perceived that a rope had been stretched across the ceiling,and that one of those nimble dancers for which Pompeii was socelebrated, and whose descendants add so charming a grace to thefestivities of Astley\'s or Vauxhall, was now treading his airy measuresright over their heads.This apparition, removed but by a cord from one\'s pericranium, andindulging the most vehement leaps, apparently with the intention ofalighting upon that cerebral region, would probably be regarded withsome terror by a party in May Fair; but our Pompeian revellers seemed tobehold the spectacle with delighted curiosity, and applauded inproportion as the dancer appeared with the most difficulty to missfalling upon the head of whatever guest he particularly selected todance above.  He paid the senator, indeed, the peculiar compliment ofliterally falling from the rope, and catching it again with his hand,just as the whole party imagined the skull of the Roman was as muchfractured as ever that of the poet whom the eagle took for a tortoise.At length, to the great relief of at least Ione, who had not muchaccustomed herself to this entertainment, the dancer suddenly paused asa strain of music was heard from without.  He danced again still morewildly; the air changed, the dancer paused again; no, it could notdissolve the charm which was supposed to possess him!  He representedone who by a strange disorder is compelled to dance, and whom only acertain air of music can cure.  At length the musician seemed to hit onthe right tune; the dancer gave one leap, swung himself down from therope, alighted on the floor, and vanished.One art now yielded to another; and the musicians who were stationedwithout on the terrace struck up a soft and mellow air, to which weresung the following words, made almost indistinct by the barrier betweenand the exceeding lowness of the minstrelsy:--             FESTIVE MUSIC SHOULD BE LOW                      I     Hark! through these flowers our music sends its greeting        To your loved halls, where Psilas shuns the day;      When the young god his Cretan nymph was meeting        He taught Pan\'s rustic pipe this gliding lay:           Soft as the dews of wine             Shed in this banquet hour,           The rich libation of Sound\'s stream divine,             O reverent harp, to Aphrodite pour!                     II     Wild rings the trump o\'er ranks to glory marching;        Music\'s sublimer bursts for war are meet;      But sweet lips murmuring under wreaths o\'er-arching,        Find the low whispers like their own most sweet.           Steal, my lull\'d music, steal             Like womans\'s half-heard tone,           So that whoe\'er shall hear, shall think to feel             In thee the voice of lips that love his own.At the end of that song Ione\'s cheek blushed more deeply than before,and Glaucus had contrived, under cover of the table, to steal her hand.\'It is a pretty song,\' said Fulvius, patronizingly.\'Ah! if you would oblige us!\' murmured the wife of Pansa.\'Do you wish Fulvius to sing?\' asked the king of the feast, who had justcalled on the assembly to drink the health of the Roman senator, a cupto each letter of his name.\'Can you ask?\' said the matron, with a complimentary glance at the poet.Sallust snapped his fingers, and whispering the slave who came to learnhis orders, the latter disappeared, and returned in a few moments with asmall harp in one hand, and a branch of myrtle in the other.  The slaveapproached the poet, and with a low reverence presented to him the harp.\'Alas! I cannot play,\' said the poet.\'Then you must sing to the myrtle.  It is a Greek fashion: Diomed lovesthe Greeks--I love the Greeks--you love the Greeks--we all love theGreeks--and between you and me this is not the only thing we have stolenfrom them. However, I introduce this custom--I, the king: sing, subject,sing!\' The poet, with a bashful smile, took the myrtle in his hands, andafter a short prelude sang as follows, in a pleasant and well-tunedvoice:--           THE CORONATION OF THE LOVES                    I           The merry Loves one holiday              Were all at gambols madly;            But Loves too long can seldom play              Without behaving sadly.           They laugh\'d, they toy\'d, they romp\'d about,           And then for change they all fell out.           Fie, fie! how can they quarrel so?              My Lesbia--ah, for shame, love           Methinks \'tis scarce an hour ago              When we did just the same, love.                    II        The Loves, \'tis thought, were free till then,           They had no king or laws, dear;         But gods, like men, should subject be,           Say all the ancient saws, dear.         And so our crew resolved, for quiet,         To choose a king to curb their riot.             A kiss: ah! what a grievous thing              For both, methinks, \'twould be, child,             If I should take some prudish king,              And cease to be so free, child!                    III        Among their toys a Casque they found,           It was the helm of Ares;         With horrent plumes the crest was crown\'d,           It frightened all the Lares.         So fine a king was never known--        They placed the helmet on the throne.         My girl, since Valor wins the world,           They chose a mighty master;         But thy sweet flag of smiles unfurled           Would win the world much faster!                    IV      The Casque soon found the Loves too wild         A troop for him to school them;       For warriors know how one such child         Has aye contrived to fool them.       They plagued him so, that in despair       He took a wife the plague to share.           If kings themselves thus find the strife              Of earth, unshared, severe, girl;           Why just to halve the ills of life,              Come, take your partner here, girl.                    V       Within that room the Bird of Love          The whole affair had eyed then;        The monarch hail\'d the royal dove,          And placed her by his side then:        What mirth amidst the Loves was seen!        \'Long live,\' they cried, \'our King and Queen.\'            Ah! Lesbia, would that thrones were mine,              And crowns to deck that brow, love!            And yet I know that heart of thine              For me is throne enow, love!                    VI       The urchins hoped to tease the mate          As they had teased the hero;        But when the Dove in judgment sate          They found her worse than Nero!        Each look a frown, each word a law;        The little subjects shook with awe.        In thee I find the same deceit--         Too late, alas! a learner!        For where a mien more gently sweet?          And where a tyrant sterner?This song, which greatly suited the gay and lively fancy of thePompeians, was received with considerable applause, and the widowinsisted on crowning her namesake with the very branch of myrtle towhich he had sung.  It was easily twisted into a garland, and theimmortal Fulvius was crowned amidst the clapping of hands and shouts ofIo triumphe!  The song and the harp now circulated round the party, anew myrtle branch being handed about, stopping at each person who couldbe prevailed upon to sing.The sun began now to decline, though the revellers, who had worn awayseveral hours, perceived it not in their darkened chamber; and thesenator, who was tired, and the warrior, who had to return toHerculaneum, rising to depart, gave the signal for the generaldispersion.  \'Tarry yet a moment, my friends,\' said Diomed; \'if you willgo so soon, you must at least take a share in our concluding game.\'So saying, he motioned to one of the ministri, and whispering him, theslave went out, and presently returned with a small bowl containingvarious tablets carefully sealed, and, apparently, exactly similar.Each guest was to purchase one of these at the nominal price of thelowest piece of silver: and the sport of this lottery (which was thefavorite diversion of Augustus, who introduced it) consisted in theinequality, and sometimes the incongruity, of the prizes, the nature andamount of which were specified within the tablets.  For instance, thepoet, with a wry face, drew one of his own poems (no physician ever lesswillingly swallowed his own draught); the warrior drew a case ofbodkins, which gave rise to certain novel witticisms relative toHercules and the distaff; the widow Fulvia obtained a largedrinking-cup; Julia, a gentleman\'s buckle; and Lepidus, a lady\'spatch-box.  The most appropriate lot was drawn by the gambler Clodius,who reddened with anger on being presented to a set of cogged dice.  Acertain damp was thrown upon the gaiety which these various lots createdby an accident that was considered ominous; Glaucus drew the mostvaluable of all the prizes, a small marble statue of Fortune, of Grecianworkmanship: on handing it to him the slave suffered it to drop, and itbroke in pieces.A shiver went round the assembly, and each voice cried spontaneously onthe gods to avert the omen.Glaucus alone, though perhaps as superstitious as the rest, affected tobe unmoved.\'Sweet Neapolitan,\' whispered he tenderly to Ione, who had turned paleas the broken marble itself, \'I accept the omen.  It signifies that inobtaining thee, Fortune can give no more--she breaks her image when sheblesses me with thine.\'In order to divert the impression which this incident had occasioned inan assembly which, considering the civilization of the guests, wouldseem miraculously superstitious, if at the present day in a countryparty we did not often see a lady grow hypochondriacal on leaving a roomlast of thirteen, Sallust now crowning his cup with flowers, gave thehealth of their host.  This was followed by a similar compliment to theemperor; and then, with a parting cup to Mercury to send them pleasantslumbers, they concluded the entertainment by a last libation, and brokeup the party. Carriages and litters were little used in Pompeii, partlyowing to the extreme narrowness of the streets, partly to the convenientsmallness of the city.  Most of the guests replacing their sandals,which they had put off in the banquet-room, and induing their cloaks,left the house on foot attended by their slaves.Meanwhile, having seen Ione depart, Glaucus turning to the staircasewhich led down to the rooms of Julia, was conducted by a slave to anapartment in which he found the merchant\'s daughter already seated.\'Glaucus!\' said she, looking down, \'I see that you really love Ione--sheis indeed beautiful.\'\'Julia is charming enough to be generous,\' replied the Greek. \'Yes, Ilove Ione; amidst all the youth who court you, may you have oneworshipper as sincere.\'\'I pray the gods to grant it!  See, Glaucus, these pearls are thepresent I destine to your bride: may Juno give her health to wear them!\'So saying, she placed a case in his hand, containing a row of pearls ofsome size and price.  It was so much the custom for persons about to bemarried to receive these gifts, that Glaucus could have little scruplein accepting the necklace, though the gallant and proud Athenian inlyresolved to requite the gift by one of thrice its value. Julia thenstopping short his thanks, poured forth some wine into a small bowl.\'You have drunk many toasts with my father,\' said she smiling--\'one nowwith me.  Health and fortune to your bride!\'She touched the cup with her lips and then presented it to Glaucus.  Thecustomary etiquette required that Glaucus should drain the wholecontents; he accordingly did so.  Julia, unknowing the deceit whichNydia had practised upon her, watched him with sparkling eyes; althoughthe witch had told her that the effect might not be immediate, she yetsanguinely trusted to an expeditious operation in favor of her charms.She was disappointed when she found Glaucus coldly replace the cup, andconverse with her in the same unmoved but gentle tone as before.  Andthough she detained him as long as she decorously could do, no changetook place in his manner.  \'But to-morrow,\' thought she, exultinglyrecovering her disappointment--\'to-morrow, alas for Glaucus!\'Alas for him, indeed!Chapter IVTHE STORY HALTS FOR A MOMENT AT AN EPISODE.RESTLESS and anxious, Apaecides consumed the day in wandering throughthe most sequestered walks in the vicinity of the city.  The sun wasslowly setting as he paused beside a lonely part of the Sarnus, ere yetit wound amidst the evidences of luxury and power. Only through openingsin the woods and vines were caught glimpses of the white and gleamingcity, in which was heard in the distance no din, no sound, nor \'busiesthum of men\'.  Amidst the green banks crept the lizard and thegrasshopper, and here and there in the brake some solitary bird burstinto sudden song, as suddenly stifled. There was deep calm around, butnot the calm of night; the air still breathed of the freshness and lifeof day; the grass still moved to the stir of the insect horde; and onthe opposite bank the graceful and white capella passed browsing throughthe herbage, and paused at the wave to drink.As Apaecides stood musingly gazing upon the waters, he heard beside himthe low bark of a dog.\'Be still, poor friend,\' said a voice at hand; \'the stranger\'s stepharms not thy master.\' The convert recognized the voice, and, turning,he beheld the old mysterious man whom he had seen in the congregation ofthe Nazarenes.The old man was sitting upon a fragment of stone covered with ancientmosses; beside him were his staff and scrip; at his feet lay a smallshaggy dog, the companion in how many a pilgrimage perilous and strange.The face of the old man was as balm to the excited spirit of theneophyte: he approached, and craving his blessing, sat down beside him.\'Thou art provided as for a journey, father,\' said he: \'wilt thou leaveus yet?\'\'My son,\' replied the old man, \'the days in store for me on earth arefew and scanty; I employ them as becomes me travelling from place toplace, comforting those whom God has gathered together in His name, andproclaiming the glory of His Son, as testified to His servant.\'\'Thou hast looked, they tell me, on the face of Christ?\'\'And the face revived me from the dead.  Know, young proselyte to thetrue faith, that I am he of whom thou readest in the scroll of theApostle.  In the far Judea, and in the city of Nain, there dwelt awidow, humble of spirit and sad of heart; for of all the ties of lifeone son alone was spared to her.  And she loved him with a melancholylove, for he was the likeness of the lost.  And the son died.  The reedon which she leaned was broken, the oil was dried up in the widow\'scruse.  They bore the dead upon his bier; and near the gate of the city,where the crowd were gathered, there came a silence over the sounds ofwoe, for the Son of God was passing by.  The mother, who followed thebier, wept--not noisily, but all who looked upon her saw that her heartwas crushed.  And the Lord pitied her, and he touched the bier, andsaid, ""I SAY UNTO THEE, ARISE,"" And the dead man woke and looked uponthe face of the Lord.  Oh, that calm and solemn brow, that unutterablesmile, that careworn and sorrowful face, lighted up with a God\'sbenignity--it chased away the shadows of the grave!  I rose, I spoke, Iwas living, and in my mother\'s arms--yes, I am the dead revived! Thepeople shouted, the funeral horns rung forth merrily: there was a cry,""God has visited His people!"" I heard them not--I felt--I saw--nothingbut the face of the Redeemer!\'The old man paused, deeply moved; and the youth felt his blood creep,and his hair stir.  He was in the presence of one who had known theMystery of Death!\'Till that time,\' renewed the widow\'s son, \'I had been as other men:thoughtless, not abandoned; taking no heed, but of the things of loveand life; nay, I had inclined to the gloomy faith of the earthlySadducee!  But, raised from the dead, from awful and desert dreams thatthese lips never dare reveal--recalled upon earth, to testify the powersof Heaven--once more mortal, the witness of immortality; I drew a newbeing from the grave.  O faded--O lost Jerusalem!--Him from whom came mylife, I beheld adjudged to the agonized and parching death!  Far in themighty crowd I saw the light rest and glimmer over the cross; I heardthe hooting mob, I cried aloud, I raved, I threatened--none heeded me--Iwas lost in the whirl and the roar of thousands!  But even then, in myagony and His own, methought the glazing eye of the Son of Man sought meout--His lip smiled, as when it conquered death--it hushed me, and Ibecame calm.  He who had defied the grave for another--what was thegrave to him?  The sun shone aslant the pale and powerful features, andthen died away!  Darkness fell over the earth; how long it endured, Iknow not.  A loud cry came through the gloom--a sharp and bittercry!--and all was silent.\'But who shall tell the terrors of the night?\' I walked along thecity--the earth reeled to and fro, and the houses trembled to theirbase--theliving had deserted the streets, but not the Dead: through thegloom I saw them glide--the dim and ghastly shapes, in the cerements ofthe grave--with horror, and woe, and warning on their unmoving lips andlightless eyes!--they swept by me, as I passed--they glared upon me--Ihad been their brother; and they bowed their heads in recognition; theyhad risen to tell the living that the dead can rise!\'Again the old man paused, and, when he resumed, it was in a calmer tone.\'From that night I resigned all earthly thought but that of serving HIM.A preacher and a pilgrim, I have traversed the remotest corners of theearth, proclaiming His Divinity, and bringing new converts to His fold.I come as the wind, and as the wind depart; sowing, as the wind sows,the seeds that enrich the world.\'Son, on earth we shall meet no more.  Forget not this hour,--what arethe pleasures and the pomps of life?  As the lamp shines, so lifeglitters for an hour; but the soul\'s light is the star that burns forever, in the heart of inimitable space.\'It was then that their conversation fell upon the general and sublimedoctrines of immortality; it soothed and elevated the young mind of theconvert, which yet clung to many of the damps and shadows of that cellof faith which he had so lately left--it was the air of heaven breathingon the prisoner released at last.  There was a strong and markeddistinction between the Christianity of the old man and that ofOlinthus; that of the first was more soft, more gentle, more divine.The heroism of Olinthus had something in it fierce and intolerant--itwas necessary to the part he was destined to play--it had in it more ofthe courage of the martyr than the charity of the saint.  It aroused, itexcited, it nerved, rather than subdued and softened.  But the wholeheart of that divine old man was bathed in love; the smile of the Deityhad burned away from it the leaven of earthlier and coarser passions,and left to the energy of the hero all the meekness of the child.\'And now,\' said he, rising at length, as the sun\'s last ray died in thewest; \'now, in the cool of twilight, I pursue my way towards theImperial Rome.  There yet dwell some holy men, who like me have beheldthe face of Christ; and them would I see before I die.\'\'But the night is chill for thine age, my father, and the way is long,and the robber haunts it; rest thee till to-morrow.\'\'Kind son, what is there in this scrip to tempt the robber?  And theNight and the Solitude!--these make the ladder round which angelscluster, and beneath which my spirit can dream of God.  Oh! none canknow what the pilgrim feels as he walks on his holy course; nursing nofear, and dreading no danger--for God is with him!  He hears the windsmurmur glad tidings; the woods sleep in the shadow of Almightywings--the stars are the Scriptures of Heaven, the tokens of love, andthe witnesses of immortality.  Night is the Pilgrim\'s day.\' With thesewords the old man pressed Apaecides to his breast, and taking up hisstaff and scrip, the dog bounded cheerily before him, and with slowsteps and downcast eyes he went his way.The convert stood watching his bended form, till the trees shut the lastglimpse from his view; and then, as the stars broke forth, he woke fromthe musings with a start, reminded of his appointment with Olinthus.Chapter VTHE PHILTRE.  ITS EFFECT.WHEN Glaucus arrived at his own home, he found Nydia seated under theportico of his garden.  In fact, she had sought his house in the merechance that he might return at an early hour: anxious, fearful,anticipative, she resolved upon seizing the earliest opportunity ofavailing herself of the love-charm, while at the same time she halfhoped the opportunity might be deferred.It was then, in that fearful burning mood, her heart beating, her cheekflushing, that Nydia awaited the possibility of Glaucus\'s return beforethe night.  He crossed the portico just as the first stars began torise, and the heaven above had assumed its most purple robe.\'Ho, my child, wait you for me?\'\'Nay, I have been tending the flowers, and did but linger a little whileto rest myself.\'\'It has been warm,\' said Glaucus, placing himself also on one of theseats beneath the colonnade.\'Very.\'\'Wilt thou summon Davus?  The wine I have drunk heats me, and I long forsome cooling drink.\'Here at once, suddenly and unexpectedly, the very opportunity that Nydiaawaited presented itself; of himself, at his own free choice, heafforded to her that occasion.  She breathed quick--\'I will prepare foryou myself,\' said she, \'the summer draught that Ione loves--of honey andweak wine cooled in snow.\'\'Thanks,\' said the unconscious Glaucus.  \'If Ione love it, enough; itwould be grateful were it poison.\'Nydia frowned, and then smiled; she withdrew for a few moments, andreturned with the cup containing the beverage.  Glaucus took it from herhand.  What would not Nydia have given then for one hour\'s prerogativeof sight, to have watched her hopes ripening to effect--to have seen thefirst dawn of the imagined love--to have worshipped with more thanPersian adoration the rising of that sun which her credulous soulbelieved was to break upon her dreary night!  Far different, as shestood then and there, were the thoughts, the emotions of the blind girl,from those of the vain Pompeian under a similar suspense.  In the last,what poor and frivolous passions had made up the daring whole! Whatpetty pique, what small revenge, what expectation of a paltry triumph,had swelled the attributes of that sentiment she dignified with the nameof love! but in the wild heart of the Thessalian all was pure,uncontrolled, unmodified passion--erring, unwomanly, frenzied, butdebased by no elements of a more sordid feeling. Filled with love aswith life itself, how could she resist the occasion of winning love inreturn!She leaned for support against the wall, and her face, before soflushed, was now white as snow, and with her delicate hands claspedconvulsively together, her lips apart, her eyes on the ground, shewaited the next words Glaucus should utter.Glaucus had raised the cup to his lips, he had already drained about afourth of its contents, when his eye suddenly glancing upon the face ofNydia, he was so forcibly struck by its alteration, by its intense, andpainful, and strange expression, that he paused abruptly, and stillholding the cup near his lips, exclaimed:\'Why, Nydia! Nydia! I say, art thou ill or in pain?  Nay, thy facespeaks for thee.  What ails my poor child?\'  As he spoke, he put downthe cup and rose from his seat to approach her, when a sudden pang shotcoldly to his heart, and was followed by a wild, confused, dizzysensation at the brain. The floor seemed to glide from under him--hisfeet seemed to move on air--a mighty and unearthly gladness rushed uponhis spirit--he felt too buoyant for the earth--he longed for wings, nay,it seemed in the buoyancy of his new existence, as if he possessed them.He burst involuntarily into a loud and thrilling laugh.  He clapped hishands--he bounded aloft--he was as a Pythoness inspired; suddenly as itcame this preternatural transport passed, though only partially, away.He now felt his blood rushing loudly and rapidly through his veins; itseemed to swell, to exult, to leap along, as a stream that has burst itsbounds, and hurries to the ocean.  It throbbed in his ear with a mightysound, he felt it mount to his brow, he felt the veins in the templesstretch and swell as if they could no longer contain the violent andincreasing tide--then a kind of darkness fell over his eyes--darkness,but not entire; for through the dim shade he saw the opposite walls glowout, and the figures painted thereon seemed, ghost-like, to creep andglide.  What was most strange, he did not feel himself ill--he did notsink or quail beneath the dread frenzy that was gathering over him. Thenovelty of the feelings seemed bright and vivid--he felt as if a youngerhealth had been infused into his frame.  He was gliding on tomadness--and he knew it not!Nydia had not answered his first question--she had not been able toreply--his wild and fearful laugh had roused her from her passionatesuspense: she could not see his fierce gesture--she could not mark hisreeling and unsteady step as he paced unconsciously to and fro; but sheheard the words, broken, incoherent, insane, that gushed from his lips.She became terrified and appalled--she hastened to him, feeling with herarms until she touched his knees, and then falling on the ground sheembraced them, weeping with terror and excitement.\'Oh, speak to me! speak! you do not hate me?--speak, speak!\'\'By the bright goddess, a beautiful land this Cyprus!  Ho! how they fillus with wine instead of blood! now they open the veins of the Faunyonder, to show how the tide within bubbles and sparkles.  Come hither,jolly old god! thou ridest on a goat, eh?--what long silky hair he has!He is worth all the coursers of Parthia.  But a word with thee--thiswine of thine is too strong for us mortals.  Oh! beautiful! the boughsare at rest! the green waves of the forest have caught the Zephyr anddrowned him!  Not a breath stirs the leaves--and I view the Dreamssleeping with folded wings upon the motionless elm; and I look beyond,and I see a blue stream sparkle in the silent noon; a fountain--afountain springing aloft!  Ah! my fount, thou wilt not put out rays ofmy Grecian sun, though thou triest ever so hard with thy nimble andsilver arms.  And now, what form steals yonder through the boughs? sheglides like a moonbeam!--she has a garland of oak-leaves on her head.In her hand is a vase upturned, from which she pours pink and tinyshells and sparkling water.  Oh! look on yon face!  Man never before sawits like.  See! we are alone; only I and she in the wide forest.  Thereis no smile upon her lips--she moves, grave and sweetly sad.  Ha! fly,it is a nymph!--it is one of the wild Napaeae!  Whoever sees her becomesmad--fly! see, she discovers me!\'\'Oh! Glaucus! Glaucus! do you not know me?  Rave not so wildly, or thouwilt kill me with a word!\'A new change seemed now to operate upon the jarring and disordered mindof the unfortunate Athenian.  He put his hand upon Nydia\'s silken hair;he smoothed the locks--he looked wistfully upon her face, and then, asin the broken chain of thought one or two links were yet unsevered, itseemed that her countenance brought its associations of Ione; and withthat remembrance his madness became yet more powerful, and it swayed andtinged by passion, as he burst forth:\'I swear by Venus, by Diana, and by Juno, that though I have now theworld on my shoulders, as my countryman Hercules (ah, dull Rome! whoeverwas truly great was of Greece; why, you would be godless if it were notfor us!)--I say, as my countryman Hercules had before me, I would let itfall into chaos for one smile from Ione.  Ah, Beautiful,--Adored,\' headded, in a voice inexpressibly fond and plaintive, \'thou lovest me not.Thou art unkind to me.  The Egyptian hath belied me to thee--thouknowest not what hours I have spent beneath thy casement--thou knowestnot how I have outwatched the stars, thinking thou, my sun, wouldst riseat last--and thou lovest me not, thou forsakest me!  Oh! do not leave menow!  I feel that my life will not be long; let me gaze on thee at leastunto the last.  I am of the bright land of thy fathers--I have trod theheights of Phyle--I have gathered the hyacinth and rose amidst theolive-groves of Ilyssus.  Thou shouldst not desert me, for thy fatherswere brothers to my own.  And they say this land is lovely, and theseclimes serene, but I will bear thee with me--Ho! dark form, why risestthou like a cloud between me and mine?  Death sits calmly dread upon thybrow--on thy lip is the smile that slays: thy name is Orcus, but onearth men call thee Arbaces.  See, I know thee! fly, dim shadow, thyspells avail not!\'\'Glaucus! Glaucus!\' murmured Nydia, releasing her hold and falling,beneath the excitement of her dismay, remorse, and anguish, insensibleon the floor.\'Who calls?\' said he in a loud voice.  \'Ione, it is she! they have borneher off--we will save her--where is my stilus?  Ha, I have it!  I come,Ione, to thy rescue!  I come!  I come!\'So saying, the Athenian with one bound passed the portico, he traversedthe house, and rushed with swift but vacillating steps, and mutteringaudibly to himself, down the starlit streets.  The direful potion burntlike fire in his veins, for its effect was made, perhaps, still moresudden from the wine he had drunk previously.  Used to the excesses ofnocturnal revellers, the citizens, with smiles and winks, gave way tohis reeling steps; they naturally imagined him under the influence ofthe Bromian god, not vainly worshipped at Pompeii; but they who lookedtwice upon his face started in a nameless fear, and the smile witheredfrom their lips.  He passed the more populous streets; and, pursuingmechanically the way to Ione\'s house, he traversed a more desertedquarter, and entered now the lonely grove of Cybele, in which Apaecideshad held his interview with Olinthus.Chapter VIA REUNION OF DIFFERENT ACTORS.  STREAMS THAT FLOWED APPARENTLY APARTRUSH INTO ONE GULF.IMPATIENT to learn whether the fell drug had yet been administered byJulia to his hated rival, and with what effect, Arbaces resolved, as theevening came on, to seek her house, and satisfy his suspense. It wascustomary, as I have before said, for men at that time to carry abroadwith them the tablets and the stilus attached to their girdle; and withthe girdle they were put off when at home.  In fact, under theappearance of a literary instrument, the Romans carried about with themin that same stilus a very sharp and formidable weapon.  It was with hisstilus that Cassius stabbed Caesar in the senate-house.  Taking, then,his girdle and his cloak, Arbaces left his house, supporting his steps,which were still somewhat feeble (though hope and vengeance hadconspired greatly with his own medical science, which was profound, torestore his natural strength), by his long staff--Arbaces took his wayto the villa of Diomed.And beautiful is the moonlight of the south!  In those climes the nightso quickly glides into the day, that twilight scarcely makes a bridgebetween them.  One moment of darker purple in the sky--of a thousandrose-hues in the water--of shade half victorious over light; and thenburst forth at once the countless stars--the moon is up--night hasresumed her reign!Brightly then, and softly bright, fell the moonbeams over the antiquegrove consecrated to Cybele--the stately trees, whose date went beyondtradition, cast their long shadows over the soil, while through theopenings in their boughs the stars shone, still and frequent.  Thewhiteness of the small sacellum in the centre of the grove, amidst thedark foliage, had in it something abrupt and startling; it recalled atonce the purpose to which the wood was consecrated--its holiness andsolemnity.With a swift and stealthy pace, Calenus, gliding under the shade of thetrees, reached the chapel, and gently putting back the boughs thatcompletely closed around its rear, settled himself in his concealment; aconcealment so complete, what with the fane in front and the treesbehind, that no unsuspicious passenger could possibly have detected him.Again, all was apparently solitary in the grove: afar off you heardfaintly the voices of some noisy revellers or the music that playedcheerily to the groups that then, as now in those climates, during thenights of summer, lingered in the streets, and enjoyed, in the fresh airand the liquid moonlight, a milder day.From the height on which the grove was placed, you saw through theintervals of the trees the broad and purple sea, rippling in thedistance, the white villas of Stabiae in the curving shore, and the dimLectiarian hills mingling with the delicious sky.  Presently the tallfigure of Arbaces, in his way to the house of Diomed, entered theextreme end of the grove; and at the same instant Apaecides, also boundto his appointment with Olinthus, crossed the Egyptian\'s path.\'Hem! Apaecides,\' said Arbaces, recognizing the priest at a glance;\'when last we met, you were my foe.  I have wished since then to seeyou, for I would have you still my pupil and my friend.\'Apaecides started at the voice of the Egyptian; and halting abruptly,gazed upon him with a countenance full of contending, bitter, andscornful emotions.\'Villain and impostor!\' said he at length; \'thou hast recovered thenfrom the jaws of the grave!  But think not again to weave around me thyguilty meshes.  Retiarius, I am armed against thee!\'\'Hush!\' said Arbaces, in a very low voice--but his pride, which in thatdescendant of kings was great, betrayed the wound it received from theinsulting epithets of the priest in the quiver of his lip and the flushof his tawny brow.  \'Hush! more low! thou mayest be overheard, and ifother ears than mine had drunk those sounds--why...\'\'Dost thou threaten?--what if the whole city had heard me?\'\'The manes of my ancestors would not have suffered me to forgive thee.But, hold, and hear me.  Thou art enraged that I would have offeredviolence to thy sister.  Nay, peace, peace, but one instant, I praythee.  Thou art right; it was the frenzy of passion and of jealousy--Ihave repented bitterly of my madness.  Forgive me; I, who never imploredpardon of living man, beseech thee now to forgive me. Nay, I will atonethe insult--I ask thy sister in marriage--start not--consider--what isthe alliance of yon holiday Greek compared to mine?  Wealthunbounded--birth that in its far antiquity leaves your Greek and Romannames the things of yesterday--science--but that thou knowest!  Give methy sister, and my whole life shall atone a moment\'s error.\'\'Egyptian, were even I to consent, my sister loathes the very air thoubreathest: but I have my own wrongs to forgive--I may pardon thee thatthou hast made me a tool to thy deceits, but never that thou hastseduced me to become the abettor of thy vices--a polluted and a perjuredman. Tremble!--even now I prepare the hour in which thou and thy falsegods shall be unveiled.  Thy lewd and Circean life shall be dragged today--thy mumming oracles disclosed--the fane of the idol Isis shall be abyword and a scorn--the name of Arbaces a mark for the hisses ofexecration!  Tremble!\'The flush on the Egyptian\'s brow was succeeded by a livid paleness.  Helooked behind, before, around, to feel assured that none were by; andthen he fixed his dark and dilating eye on the priest, with such a gazeof wrath and menace, that one, perhaps, less supported than Apaecides bythe fervent daring of a divine zeal, could not have faced withunflinching look that lowering aspect. As it was, however, the youngconvert met it unmoved, and returned it with an eye of proud defiance.\'Apaecides,\' said the Egyptian, in a tremulous and inward tone, \'beware!What is it thou wouldst meditate?  Speakest thou--reflect, pause beforethou repliest--from the hasty influences of wrath, as yet divining nosettled purpose, or from some fixed design?\'\'I speak from the inspiration of the True God, whose servant I now am,\'answered the Christian, boldly; \'and in the knowledge that by His gracehuman courage has already fixed the date of thy hypocrisy and thydemon\'s worship; ere thrice the sun has dawned, thou wilt know all!Dark sorcerer, tremble, and farewell!\'All the fierce and lurid passions which he inherited from his nation andhis clime, at all times but ill concealed beneath the blandness of craftand the coldness of philosophy, were released in the breast of theEgyptian. Rapidly one thought chased another; he saw before him anobstinate barrier to even a lawful alliance with Ione--thefellow-champion of Glaucus in the struggle which had baffled hisdesigns--the reviler of his name--the threatened desecrator of thegoddess he served while he disbelieved--the avowed and approachingrevealer of his own impostures and vices.  His love, his repute, nay,his very life, might be in danger--the day and hour seemed even to havebeen fixed for some design against him.  He knew by the words of theconvert that Apaecides had adopted the Christian faith: he knew theindomitable zeal which led on the proselytes of that creed.  Such washis enemy; he grasped his stilus--that enemy was in his power! They werenow before the chapel; one hasty glance once more he cast around; he sawnone near--silence and solitude alike tempted him.\'Die, then, in thy rashness!\' he muttered; \'away, obstacle to my rushingfates!\'And just as the young Christian had turned to depart, Arbaces raised hishand high over the left shoulder of Apaecides, and plunged his sharpweapon twice into his breast.Apaecides fell to the ground pierced to the heart--he fell mute, withouteven a groan, at the very base of the sacred chapel.Arbaces gazed upon him for a moment with the fierce animal joy ofconquest over a foe.  But presently the full sense of the danger towhich he was exposed flashed upon him; he wiped his weapon carefully inthe long grass, and with the very garments of his victim; drew his cloakround him, and was about to depart, when he saw, coming up the path,right before him, the figure of a young man, whose steps reeled andvacillated strangely as he advanced: the quiet moonlight streamed fullupon his face, which seemed, by the whitening ray, colorless as marble.The Egyptian recognized the face and form of Glaucus.  The unfortunateand benighted Greek was chanting a disconnected and mad song, composedfrom snatches of hymns and sacred odes, all jarringly woven together.\'Ha!\' thought the Egyptian, instantaneously divining his state and itsterrible cause; \'so, then, the hell-draught works, and destiny hath sentthee hither to crush two of my foes at once!\'Quickly, even ere this thought occurred to him, he had withdrawn on oneside of the chapel, and concealed himself amongst the boughs; from thatlurking place he watched, as a tiger in his lair, the advance of hissecond victim. He noted the wandering and restless fire in the brightand beautiful eyes of the Athenian; the convulsions that distorted hisstatue-like features, and writhed his hueless lip.  He saw that theGreek was utterly deprived of reason.  Nevertheless, as Glaucus came upto the dead body of Apaecides, from which the dark red stream flowedslowly over the grass, so strange and ghastly a spectacle could not failto arrest him, benighted and erring as was his glimmering sense.  Hepaused, placed his hand to his brow, as if to collect himself, and thensaying:\'What ho! Endymion, sleepest thou so soundly?  What has the moon said tothee?  Thou makest me jealous; it is time to wake\'--he stooped down withthe intention of lifting up the body.Forgetting--feeling not--his own debility, the Egyptian sprung from hishiding-place, and, as the Greek bent, struck him forcibly to the ground,over the very body of the Christian; then, raising his powerful voice toits highest pitch, he shouted:\'Ho, citizens--oh! help me!--run hither--hither!--A murder--a murderbefore your very fane!  Help, or the murderer escapes!\' As he spoke, heplaced his foot on the breast of Glaucus: an idle and superfluousprecaution; for the potion operating with the fall, the Greek lay theremotionless and insensible, save that now and then his lips gave vent tosome vague and raving sounds.As he there stood awaiting the coming of those his voice still continuedto summons, perhaps some remorse, some compunctious visitings--fordespite his crimes he was human--haunted the breast of the Egyptian; thedefenceless state of Glaucus--his wandering words--his shattered reason,smote him even more than the death of Apaecides, and he said, halfaudibly, to himself:\'Poor clay!--poor human reason; where is the soul now?  I could sparethee, O my rival--rival never more!  But destiny must be obeyed--mysafety demands thy sacrifice.\' With that, as if to drown compunction, heshouted yet more loudly; and drawing from the girdle of Glaucus thestilus it contained, he steeped it in the blood of the murdered man, andlaid it beside the corpse.And now, fast and breathless, several of the citizens came thronging tothe place, some with torches, which the moon rendered unnecessary, butwhich flared red and tremulously against the darkness of the trees; theysurrounded the spot.  \'Lift up yon corpse,\' said the Egyptian, \'andguard well the murderer.\'They raised the body, and great was their horror and sacred indignationto discover in that lifeless clay a priest of the adored and venerableIsis; but still greater, perhaps, was their surprise, when they foundthe accused in the brilliant and admired Athenian.\'Glaucus!\' cried the bystanders, with one accord; \'is it even credible?\'\'I would sooner,\' whispered one man to his neighbor, \'believe it to bethe Egyptian himself.\'Here a centurion thrust himself into the gathering crowd, with an air ofauthority.\'How! blood spilt! who the murderer?\'The bystanders pointed to Glaucus.\'He!--by Mars, he has rather the air of being the victim!\'Who accuses him?\'\'I,\' said Arbaces, drawing himself up haughtily; and the jewels whichadorned his dress flashing in the eyes of the soldier, instantlyconvinced that worthy warrior of the witness\'s respectability.\'Pardon me--your name?\' said he.\'Arbaces; it is well known methinks in Pompeii.  Passing through thegrove, I beheld before me the Greek and the priest in earnestconversation.  I was struck by the reeling motions of the first, hisviolent gestures, and the loudness of his voice; he seemed to me eitherdrunk or mad.  Suddenly I saw him raise his stilus--I dartedforward--too late to arrest the blow.  He had twice stabbed his victim,and was bending over him, when, in my horror and indignation, I struckthe murderer to the ground.  He fell without a struggle, which makes meyet more suspect that he was not altogether in his senses when the crimewas perpetrated; for, recently recovered from a severe illness, my blowwas comparatively feeble, and the frame of Glaucus, as you see, isstrong and youthful.\'\'His eyes are open now--his lips move,\' said the soldier. \'Speak,prisoner, what sayest thou to the charge?\'\'The charge--ha--ha!  Why, it was merrily done; when the old hag set herserpent at me, and Hecate stood by laughing from ear to ear--what couldI do?  But I am ill--I faint--the serpent\'s fiery tongue hath bitten me.Bear me to bed, and send for your physician; old AEsculapius himselfwill attend me if you let him know that I am Greek.  Oh, mercy--mercy!I burn!--marrow and brain, I burn!\'And, with a thrilling and fierce groan, the Athenian fell back in thearms of the bystanders.\'He raves,\' said the officer, compassionately; \'and in his delirium hehas struck the priest.  Hath any one present seen him to-day!\'\'I,\' said one of the spectators, \'beheld him in the morning.  He passedmy shop and accosted me.  He seemed well and sane as the stoutest ofus!\'\'And I saw him half an hour ago,\' said another, \'passing up the streets,muttering to himself with strange gestures, and just as the Egyptian hasdescribed.\'\'A corroboration of the witness! it must be too true.  He must at allevents to the praetor; a pity, so young and so rich!  But the crime isdreadful: a priest of Isis, in his very robes, too, and at the baseitself of our most ancient chapel!\'At these words the crowd were reminded more forcibly, than in theirexcitement and curiosity they had yet been, of the heinousness of thesacrilege.  They shuddered in pious horror.\'No wonder the earth has quaked,\' said one, \'when it held such amonster!\'\'Away with him to prison--away!\' cried they all.And one solitary voice was heard shrilly and joyously above the rest:\'The beasts will not want a gladiator now,  Ho, ho, for the merry, merryshow!It was the voice of the young woman whose conversation with Medon hasbeen repeated.\'True--true--it chances in season for the games!\' cried several; and atthat thought all pity for the accused seemed vanished.  His youth, hisbeauty, but fitted him better for the purpose of the arena.\'Bring hither some planks--or if at hand, a litter--to bear the dead,\'said Arbaces: \'a priest of Isis ought scarcely to be carried to histemple by vulgar hands, like a butchered gladiator.\'At this the bystanders reverently laid the corpse of Apaecides on theground, with the face upwards; and some of them went in search of somecontrivance to bear the body, untouched by the profane.It was just at that time that the crowd gave way to right and left as asturdy form forced itself through, and Olinthus the Christian stoodimmediately confronting the Egyptian.  But his eyes, at first, onlyrested with inexpressible grief and horror on that gory side andupturned face, on which the agony of violent death yet lingered.\'Murdered!\' he said.  \'Is it thy zeal that has brought thee to this?Have they detected thy noble purpose, and by death prevented their ownshame?\'He turned his head abruptly, and his eyes fell full on the solemnfeatures of the Egyptian.As he looked, you might see in his face, and even the slight shiver ofhis frame, the repugnance and aversion which the Christian felt for onewhom he knew to be so dangerous and so criminal.  It was indeed the gazeof the bird upon the basilisk--so silent was it and so prolonged.  Butshaking off the sudden chill that had crept over him, Olinthus extendedhis right arm towards Arbaces, and said, in a deep and loud voice:\'Murder hath been done upon this corpse!  Where is the murderer? Standforth, Egyptian!  For, as the Lord liveth, I believe thou art the man!\'An anxious and perturbed change might for one moment be detected on thedusky features of Arbaces; but it gave way to the frowning expression ofindignation and scorn, as, awed and arrested by the suddenness andvehemence of the charge, the spectators pressed nearer and nearer uponthe two more prominent actors.\'I know,\' said Arbaces, proudly, \'who is my accuser, and I guesswherefore he thus arraigns me.  Men and citizens, know this man for themost bitter of the Nazarenes, if that or Christians be their propername!  What marvel that in his malignity he dares accuse even anEgyptian of the murder of a priest of Egypt!\'\'I know him!  I know the dog!\' shouted several voices.  \'It is Olinthusthe Christian--or rather the Atheist--he denies the gods!\'\'Peace, brethren,\' said Olinthus, with dignity, \'and hear me!  Thismurdered priest of Isis before his death embraced the Christianfaith--he revealed to me the dark sins, the sorceries of yonEgyptian--the mummeries and delusions of the fane of Isis.  He was aboutto declare them publicly.  He, a stranger, unoffending, without enemies!who should shed his blood but one of those who feared his witness?  Whomight fear that testimony the most?--Arbaces, the Egyptian!\'\'You hear him!\' said Arbaces; \'you hear him! he blasphemes!  Ask him ifhe believes in Isis!\'\'Do I believe in an evil demon?\' returned Olinthus, boldly.A groan and shudder passed through the assembly.  Nothing daunted, forprepared at every time for peril, and in the present excitement losingall prudence, the Christian continued:\'Back, idolaters! this clay is not for your vain and polluting rites--itis to us--to the followers of Christ, that the last offices due to aChristian belong.  I claim this dust in the name of the great Creatorwho has recalled the spirit!\'With so solemn and commanding a voice and aspect the Christian spokethese words, that even the crowd forbore to utter aloud the execrationof fear and hatred which in their hearts they conceived. And never,perhaps, since Lucifer and the Archangel contended for the body of themighty Lawgiver, was there a more striking subject for the painter\'sgenius than that scene exhibited.  The dark trees--the stately fane--themoon full on the corpse of the deceased--the torches tossing wildly toand fro in the rear--the various faces of the motley audience--theinsensible form of the Athenian, supported, in the distance, and in theforeground, and above all, the forms of Arbaces and the Christian: thefirst drawn to its full height, far taller than the herd around; hisarms folded, his brow knit, his eyes fixed, his lip slightly curled indefiance and disdain.  The last bearing, on a brow worn and furrowed,the majesty of an equal command--the features stern, yet frank--theaspect bold, yet open--the quiet dignity of the whole form impressedwith an ineffable earnestness, hushed, as it were, in a solemn sympathywith the awe he himself had created.  His left hand pointing to thecorpse--his right hand raised to heaven.The centurion pressed forward again.\'In the first place, hast thou, Olinthus, or whatever be thy name, anyproof of the charge thou hast made against Arbaces, beyond thy vaguesuspicions?\'Olinthus remained silent--the Egyptian laughed contemptuously.\'Dost thou claim the body of a priest of Isis as one of the Nazarene orChristian sect?\'\'I do.\'\'Swear then by yon fane, yon statue of Cybele, by yon most ancientsacellum in Pompeii, that the dead man embraced your faith!\'\'Vain man!  I disown your idols!  I abhor your temples!  How can I swearby Cybele then?\'\'Away, away with the Atheist! away! the earth will swallow us, if wesuffer these blasphemers in a sacred grove--away with him to death!\'\'To the beasts!\' added a female voice in the centre of the crowd; \'weshall have one a-piece now for the lion and tiger!\'\'If, O Nazarene, thou disbelievest in Cybele, which of our gods dostthou own?\' resumed the soldier, unmoved by the cries around.\'None!\'\'Hark to him! hark!\' cried the crowd.\'O vain and blind!\' continued the Christian, raising his voice: \'can youbelieve in images of wood and stone?  Do you imagine that they have eyesto see, or ears to hear, or hands to help ye?  Is yon mute thing carvedby man\'s art a goddess!--hath it made mankind?--alas! by mankind was itmade. Lo! convince yourself of its nothingness--of your folly.\'And as he spoke he strode across to the fane, and ere any of thebystanders were aware of his purpose, he, in his compassion or his zeal,struck the statue of wood from its pedestal.\'See!\' cried he, \'your goddess cannot avenge herself.  Is this a thingto worship?\'Further words were denied to him: so gross and daring a sacrilege--ofone, too, of the most sacred of their places of worship--filled even themost lukewarm with rage and horror.  With one accord the crowd rushedupon him, seized, and but for the interference of the centurion, theywould have torn him to pieces.\'Peace!\' said the soldier, authoritatively--\'refer we this insolentblasphemer to the proper tribunal--time has been already wasted.  Bearwe both the culprits to the magistrates; place the body of the priest onthe litter--carry it to his own home.\'At this moment a priest of Isis stepped forward.  \'I claim theseremains, according to the custom of the priesthood.\'\'The flamen be obeyed,\' said the centurion.  \'How is the murderer?\'\'Insensible or asleep.\'\'Were his crimes less, I could pity him.  On!\'Arbaces, as he turned, met the eye of that priest of Isis--it wasCalenus; and something there was in that glance, so significant andsinister, that the Egyptian muttered to himself:\'Could he have witnessed the deed?\'A girl darted from the crowd, and gazed hard on the face of Olinthus.\'By Jupiter, a stout knave!  I say, we shall have a man for the tigernow; one for each beast!\'\'Ho!\' shouted the mob; \'a man for the lion, and another for the tiger!What luck!  Io Paean!\'Chapter VIIIN WHICH THE READER LEARNS THE CONDITION OF GLAUCUS.  FRIENDSHIP TESTED.ENMITY SOFTENED.  LOVE THE SAME, BECAUSE THE ONE LOVING IS BLIND.THE night was somewhat advanced, and the gay lounging places of thePompeians were still crowded.  You might observe in the countenances ofthe various idlers a more earnest expression than usual.  They talked inlarge knots and groups, as if they sought by numbers to divide thehalf-painful, half-pleasurable anxiety which belonged to the subjecton which they conversed: it was a subject of life and death.A young man passed briskly by the graceful portico of the Temple ofFortune--so briskly, indeed, that he came with no slight force fullagainst the rotund and comely form of that respectable citizen Diomed,who was retiring homeward to his suburban villa.\'Holloa!\' groaned the merchant, recovering with some difficulty hisequilibrium; \'have you no eyes? or do you think I have no feeling? ByJupiter! you have well nigh driven out the divine particle; such anothershock, and my soul will be in Hades!\'\'Ah, Diomed! is it you?  forgive my inadvertence.  I was absorbed inthinking of the reverses of life.  Our poor friend, Glaucus, eh! whocould have guessed it?\'\'Well, but tell me, Clodius, is he really to be tried by the senate?\'\'Yes; they say the crime is of so extraordinary a nature that the senateitself must adjudge it; and so the lictors are to induct him formally.\'\'He has been accused publicly, then?\'\'To be sure; where have you been not to hear that?\'\'Why, I have only just returned from Neapolis, whither I went onbusiness the very morning after his crime--so shocking, and at my housethe same night that it happened!\'\'There is no doubt of his guilt,\' said Clodius, shrugging his shoulders;\'and as these crimes take precedence of all little undignifiedpeccadilloes, they will hasten to finish the sentence previous to thegames.\'\'The games!  Good gods!\' replied Diomed, with a slight shudder: \'canthey adjudge him to the beasts?--so young, so rich!\'\'True; but then he is a Greek.  Had he been a Roman, it would have beena thousand pities.  These foreigners can be borne with in theirprosperity; but in adversity we must not forget that they are in realityslaves. However, we of the upper classes are always tender-hearted; andhe would certainly get off tolerably well if he were left to us: for,between ourselves, what is a paltry priest of Isis!--what Isis herself?But the common people are superstitious; they clamor for the blood ofthe sacrilegious one.  It is dangerous not to give way to publicopinion.\'\'And the blasphemer--the Christian, or Nazarene, or whatever else he becalled?\'\'Oh, poor dog! if he will sacrifice to Cybele or Isis, he will bepardoned--if not, the tiger has him.  At least, so I suppose; but thetrial will decide.  We talk while the urn\'s still empty.  And the Greekmay yet escape the deadly Theta of his own alphabet.  But enough of thisgloomy subject.  How is the fair Julia?\'\'Well, I fancy.\'\'Commend me to her.  But hark! the door yonder creaks on its hinges; itis the house of the praetor.  Who comes forth?  By Pollux! it is theEgyptian! What can he want with our official friend!\'\'Some conference touching the murder, doubtless,\' replied Diomed; \'butwhat was supposed to be the inducement to the crime? Glaucus was to havemarried the priest\'s sister.\'\'Yes: some say Apaecides refused the alliance.  It might have been asudden quarrel.  Glaucus was evidently drunk--nay, so much so as tohave been quite insensible when taken up, and I hear is stilldelirious--whether with wine, terror, remorse, the Furies, or theBacchanals, I cannot say.\'\'Poor fellow!--he has good counsel?\'\'The best--Caius Pollio, an eloquent fellow enough.  Pollio has beenhiring all the poor gentlemen and well-born spendthrifts of Pompeii todress shabbily and sneak about, swearing their friendship to Glaucus(who would not have spoken to them to be made emperor!--I will do himjustice, he was a gentleman in his choice of acquaintance), and tryingto melt the stony citizens into pity.  But it will not do; Isis ismightily popular just at this moment.\'\'And, by-the-by, I have some merchandise at Alexandria.  Yes, Isis oughtto be protected.\'\'True; so farewell, old gentleman: we shall meet soon; if not, we musthave a friendly bet at the Amphitheatre.  All my calculations areconfounded by this cursed misfortune of Glaucus!  He had bet on Lydonthe gladiator; I must make up my tablets elsewhere.  Vale!\'Leaving the less active Diomed to regain his villa, Clodius strode on,humming a Greek air, and perfuming the night with the odours thatsteamed from his snowy garments and flowing locks.\'If,\' thought he, \'Glaucus feed the lion, Julia will no longer have aperson to love better than me; she will certainly doat on me--and so, Isuppose, I must marry.  By the gods! the twelve lines begin to fail--menlook suspiciously at my hand when it rattles the dice. That infernalSallust insinuates cheating; and if it be discovered that the ivory isclogged, why farewell to the merry supper and the perfumedbillet--Clodius is undone! Better marry, then, while I may, renouncegaming, and push my fortune (or rather the gentle Julia\'s) at theimperial court.\'Thus muttering the schemes of his ambition, if by that high name theprojects of Clodius may be called, the gamester found himself suddenlyaccosted; he turned and beheld the dark brow of Arbaces.\'Hail, noble Clodius! pardon my interruption; and inform me, I pray you,which is the house of Sallust?\'\'It is but a few yards hence, wise Arbaces.  But does Sallust entertainto-night?\'\'I know not,\' answered the Egyptian; \'nor am I, perhaps, one of thosewhom he would seek as a boon companion.  But thou knowest that his households the person of Glaucus, the murderer.\'\'Ay! he, good-hearted epicure, believes in the Greek\'s innocence!  Youremind me that he has become his surety; and, therefore, till the trial,is responsible for his appearance. Well, Sallust\'s house is better thana prison, especially that wretched hole in the forum.  But for what canyou seek Glaucus?\'\'Why, noble Clodius, if we could save him from execution it would bewell. The condemnation of the rich is a blow upon society itself.  Ishould like to confer with him--for I hear he has recovered hissenses--and ascertain the motives of his crime; they may be soextenuating as to plead in his defence.\'\'You are benevolent, Arbaces.\'\'Benevolence is the duty of one who aspires to wisdom,\' replied theEgyptian, modestly.  \'Which way lies Sallust\'s mansion?\'\'I will show you,\' said Clodius, \'if you will suffer me to accompany youa few steps.  But, pray what has become of the poor girl who was to havewed the Athenian--the sister of the murdered priest?\'\'Alas! well-nigh insane!  Sometimes she utters imprecations on themurderer--then suddenly stops short--then cries, ""But why curse? Oh, mybrother! Glaucus was not thy murderer--never will I believe it!"" Thenshe begins again, and again stops short, and mutters awfully to herself,""Yet if it were indeed he?""\'\'Unfortunate Ione!\'\'But it is well for her that those solemn cares to the dead whichreligion enjoins have hitherto greatly absorbed her attention fromGlaucus and herself: and, in the dimness of her senses, she scarcelyseems aware that Glaucus is apprehended and on the eve of trial.  Whenthe funeral rites due to Apaecides are performed, her apprehension willreturn; and then I fear me much that her friends will be revolted byseeing her run to succour and aid the murderer of her brother!\'\'Such scandal should be prevented.\'\'I trust I have taken precautions to that effect.  I am her lawfulguardian, and have just succeeded in obtaining permission to escort her,after the funeral of Apaecides, to my own house; there, please the gods!she will be secure.\'\'You have done well, sage Arbaces.  And, now, yonder is the house ofSallust.  The gods keep you!  Yet, hark you, Arbaces--why so gloomy andunsocial?  Men say you can be gay--why not let me initiate you into thepleasures of Pompeii?--I flatter myself no one knows them better.\'\'I thank you, noble Clodius: under your auspices I might venture, Ithink, to wear the philyra: but, at my age, I should be an awkwardpupil.\'\'Oh, never fear; I have made converts of fellows of seventy.  The rich,too, are never old.\'\'You flatter me.  At some future time I will remind you of yourpromise.\'\'You may command Marcus Clodius at all times--and so, vale!\'\'Now,\' said the Egyptian, soliloquising, \'I am not wantonly a man ofblood; I would willingly save this Greek, if, by confessing the crime,he will lose himself for ever to Ione, and for ever free me from thechance of discovery; and I can save him by persuading Julia to own thephiltre, which will be held his excuse.  But if he do not confess thecrime, why, Julia must be shamed from the confession, and he mustdie!--die, lest he prove my rival with the living--die, that he may bemy proxy with the dead!  Will he confess?--can he not be persuaded thatin his delirium he struck the blow? To me it would give far greatersafety than even his death.  Hem! we must hazard the experiment.\'Sweeping along the narrow street, Arbaces now approached the house ofSallust, when he beheld a dark form wrapped in a cloak, and stretched atlength across the threshold of the door.So still lay the figure, and so dim was its outline, that any other thanArbaces might have felt a superstitious fear, lest he beheld one ofthose grim lemures, who, above all other spots, haunted the threshold ofthe homes they formerly possessed.  But not for Arbaces were suchdreams.\'Rise!\' said he, touching the figure with his foot; \'thou obstructestthe way!\'\'Ha! who art thou,\' cried the form, in a sharp tone, and as she raisedherself from the ground, the starlight fell full on the pale face andfixed but sightless eyes of Nydia the Thessalian.  \'Who art thou?  Iknow the burden of thy voice.\'\'Blind girl! what dost thou here at this late hour?  Fie!--is thisseeming thy sex or years?  Home, girl!\'\'I know thee,\' said Nydia, in a low voice, \'thou art Arbaces theEgyptian\': then, as if inspired by some sudden impulse, she flungherself at his feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed, in a wild andpassionate tone, \'Oh dread and potent man! save him--save him! He is notguilty--it is I!  He lies within, ill-dying, and I--I am the hatefulcause!  And they will not admit me to him--they spurn the blind girlfrom the hall.  Oh, heal him! thou knowest some herb--some spell--somecountercharm, for it is a potion that hath wrought this frenzy!\'\'Hush, child!  I know all!--thou forgettest that I accompanied Julia tothe saga\'s home.  Doubtless her hand administered the draught; but herreputation demands thy silence.  Reproach not thyself--what must be,must: meanwhile, I seek the criminal--he may yet be saved. Away!\'Thus saying, Arbaces extricated himself from the clasp of the despairingThessalian, and knocked loudly at the door.In a few moments the heavy bars were heard suddenly to yield, and theporter, half opening the door, demanded who was there.\'Arbaces--important business to Sallust relative to Glaucus.  I comefrom the praetor.\'The porter, half yawning, half groaning, admitted the tall form of theEgyptian.  Nydia sprang forward.  \'How is he?\' she cried; \'tell me--tellme!\'\'Ho, mad girl! is it thou still?--for shame!  Why, they say he issensible.\'\'The gods be praised!--and you will not admit me?  Ah! I beseechthee...\'\'Admit thee!--no.  A pretty salute I should prepare for these shoulderswere I to admit such things as thou!  Go home!\'The door closed, and Nydia, with a deep sigh, laid herself down oncemore on the cold stones; and, wrapping her cloak round her face, resumedher weary vigil.Meanwhile Arbaces had already gained the triclinium, where Sallust, withhis favorite freedman, sat late at supper.\'What!  Arbaces! and at this hour!--Accept this cup.\'\'Nay, gentle Sallust; it is on business, not pleasure, that I venture todisturb thee.  How doth thy charge?--they say in the town that he hasrecovered sense.\'\'Alas! and truly,\' replied the good-natured but thoughtless Sallust,wiping the tear from his eyes; \'but so shattered are his nerves andframe that I scarcely recognize the brilliant and gay carouser I waswont to know.  Yet, strange to say, he cannot account for the cause ofthe sudden frenzy that seized him--he retains but a dim consciousness ofwhat hath passed; and, despite thy witness, wise Egyptian, solemnlyupholds his innocence of the death of Apaecides.\'\'Sallust,\' said Arbaces, gravely, \'there is much in thy friend\'s casethat merits a peculiar indulgence; and could we learn from his lips theconfession and the cause of his crime, much might be yet hoped from themercy of the senate; for the senate, thou knowest, hath the power eitherto mitigate or to sharpen the law.  Therefore it is that I haveconferred with the highest authority of the city, and obtained hispermission to hold a private conference this night with the Athenian.Tomorrow, thou knowest, the trial comes on.\'\'Well,\' said Sallust, \'thou wilt be worthy of thy Eastern name and fameif thou canst learn aught from him; but thou mayst try.  PoorGlaucus!--and he had such an excellent appetite!  He eats nothing now!\'The benevolent epicure was moved sensibly at this thought.  He sighed,and ordered his slaves to refill his cup.\'Night wanes,\' said the Egyptian; \'suffer me to see thy ward now.\'Sallust nodded assent, and led the way to a small chamber, guardedwithout by two dozing slaves.  The door opened; at the request ofArbaces, Sallust withdrew--the Egyptian was alone with Glaucus.One of those tall and graceful candelabra common to that day, supportinga single lamp, burned beside the narrow bed.  Its rays fell palely overthe face of the Athenian, and Arbaces was moved to see how sensibly thatcountenance had changed.  The rich color was gone, the cheek was sunk,the lips were convulsed and pallid; fierce had been the struggle betweenreason and madness, life and death. The youth, the strength of Glaucushad conquered; but the freshness of blood and soul--the life oflife--its glory and its zest, were gone for ever.The Egyptian seated himself quietly beside the bed; Glaucus still laymute and unconscious of his presence.  At length, after a considerablepause, Arbaces thus spoke:\'Glaucus, we have been enemies.  I come to thee alone and in the dead ofnight--thy friend, perhaps thy saviour.\'As the steed starts from the path of the tiger, Glaucus sprang upbreathless--alarmed, panting at the abrupt voice, the sudden apparitionof his foe.  Their eyes met, and neither, for some moments, had power towithdraw his gaze.  The flush went and came over the face of theAthenian, and the bronzed cheek of the Egyptian grew a shade more pale.At length, with an inward groan, Glaucus turned away, drew his handacross his brow, sunk back, and muttered:\'Am I still dreaming?\'\'No, Glaucus thou art awake.  By this right hand and my father\'s head,thou seest one who may save thy life.  Hark! I know what thou hast done,but I know also its excuse, of which thou thyself art ignorant.  Thouhast committed murder, it is true--a sacrilegious murder--frownnot--start not--these eyes saw it.  But I can save thee--I can prove howthou wert bereaved of sense, and made not a free-thinking andfree-acting man.  But in order to save thee, thou must confess thy crime.Sign but this paper, acknowledging thy hand in the death of Apaecides,and thou shalt avoid the fatal urn.\'\'What words are these?--Murder and Apaecides!--Did I not see himstretched on the ground bleeding and a corpse? and wouldst thou persuademe that I did the deed?  Man, thou liest!  Away!\'\'Be not rash--Glaucus, be not hasty; the deed is proved.  Come, come,thou mayst well be excused for not recalling the act of thy delirium,and which thy sober senses would have shunned even to contemplate.  Butlet me try to refresh thy exhausted and weary memory. Thou knowest thouwert walking with the priest, disputing about his sister; thou knowesthe was intolerant, and half a Nazarene, and he sought to convert thee,and ye had hot words; and he calumniated thy mode of life, and swore hewould not marry Ione to thee--and then, in thy wrath and thy frenzy,thou didst strike the sudden blow. Come, come; you can recollectthis!--read this papyrus, it runs to that effect--sign it, and thouart saved.\'\'Barbarian, give me the written lie, that I may tear it!  I the murdererof Ione\'s brother: I confess to have injured one hair of the head of himshe loved!  Let me rather perish a thousand times!\'\'Beware!\' said Arbaces, in a low and hissing tone; \'there is but onechoice--thy confession and thy signature, or the amphitheatre and thelion\'s maw!\'As the Egyptian fixed his eyes upon the sufferer, he hailed with joy thesigns of evident emotion that seized the latter at these words.  Aslight shudder passed over the Athenian\'s frame--his lip fell--anexpression of sudden fear and wonder betrayed itself in his brow andeye.\'Great gods!\' he said, in a low voice, \'what reverse is this?  It seemsbut a little day since life laughed out from amidst roses--Ionemine--youth, health, love, lavishing on me their treasures; andnow--pain, madness, shame, death!  And for what?  What have I done?Oh, I am mad still?\'\'Sign, and be saved!\' said the soft, sweet voice of the Egyptian.\'Tempter, never!\' cried Glaucus, in the reaction of rage.  \'Thou knowestme not: thou knowest not the haughty soul of an Athenian! The suddenface of death might appal me for a moment, but the fear is over.Dishonour appals for ever!  Who will debase his name to save his life?who exchange clear thoughts for sullen days? who will belie himself toshame, and stand blackened in the eyes of love?  If to earn a few yearsof polluted life there be so base a coward, dream not, dull barbarian ofEgypt! to find him in one who has trod the same sod as Harmodius, andbreathed the same air as Socrates.  Go! leave me to live withoutself-reproach--or to perish without fear!\'\'Bethink thee well! the lion\'s fangs: the hoots of the brutal mob: thevulgar gaze on thy dying agony and mutilated limbs: thy name degraded;thy corpse unburied; the shame thou wouldst avoid clinging to thee foraye and ever!\'\'Thou ravest; thou art the madman! shame is not in the loss of othermen\'s esteem--it is in the loss of our own.  Wilt thou go?--my eyesloathe the sight of thee! hating ever, I despise thee now!\'\'I go,\' said Arbaces, stung and exasperated, but not without somepitying admiration of his victim, \'I go; we meet twice again--once atthe Trial, once at the Death!  Farewell!\'The Egyptian rose slowly, gathered his robes about him, and left thechamber.  He sought Sallust for a moment, whose eyes began to reel withthe vigils of the cup: \'He is still unconscious, or still obstinate;there is no hope for him.\'\'Say not so,\' replied Sallust, who felt but little resentment againstthe Athenian\'s accuser, for he possessed no great austerity of virtue,and was rather moved by his friend\'s reverses than persuaded of hisinnocence--\'say not so, my Egyptian! so good a drinker shall be saved ifpossible.  Bacchus against Isis!\'\'We shall see,\' said the Egyptian.Suddenly the bolts were again withdrawn--the door unclosed; Arbaces wasin the open street; and poor Nydia once more started from her longwatch.\'Wilt thou save him?\' she cried, clasping her hands.\'Child, follow me home; I would speak to thee--it is for his sake I askit.\'\'And thou wilt save him?\'No answer came forth to the thirsting ear of the blind girl: Arbaces hadalready proceeded far up the street; she hesitated a moment, and thenfollowed his steps in silence.\'I must secure this girl,\' said he, musingly, \'lest she give evidence ofthe philtre; as to the vain Julia, she will not betray herself.\'Chapter VIIIA CLASSIC FUNERAL.WHILE Arbaces had been thus employed, Sorrow and Death were in the houseof Ione.  It was the night preceding the morn in which the solemnfuneral rites were to be decreed to the remains of the murderedApaecides.  The corpse had been removed from the temple of Isis to thehouse of the nearest surviving relative, and Ione had heard, in the samebreath, the death of her brother and the accusation against herbetrothed.  That first violent anguish which blunts the sense to all butitself, and the forbearing silence of her slaves, had prevented herlearning minutely the circumstances attendant on the fate of her lover.His illness, his frenzy, and his approaching trial, were unknown to her.She learned only the accusation against him, and at once indignantlyrejected it; nay, on hearing that Arbaces was the accuser, she requiredno more to induce her firmly and solemnly to believe that the Egyptianhimself was the criminal.  But the vast and absorbing importanceattached by the ancients to the performance of every ceremonialconnected with the death of a relation, had, as yet, confined her woeand her convictions to the chamber of the deceased.  Alas! it was notfor her to perform that tender and touching office, which obliged thenearest relative to endeavor to catch the last breath--the partingsoul--of the beloved one: but it was hers to close the straining eyes,the distorted lips: to watch by the consecrated clay, as, fresh bathedand anointed, it lay in festive robes upon the ivory bed; to strew thecouch with leaves and flowers, and to renew the solemn cypress-branch atthe threshold of the door.  And in these sad offices, in lamentation andin prayer, Ione forgot herself.  It was among the loveliest customs ofthe ancients to bury the young at the morning twilight; for, as theystrove to give the softest interpretation to death, so they poeticallyimagined that Aurora, who loved the young, had stolen them to herembrace; and though in the instance of the murdered priest this fablecould not appropriately cheat the fancy, the general custom was stillpreserved.The stars were fading one by one from the grey heavens, and night slowlyreceding before the approach of morn, when a dark group stood motionlessbefore Ione\'s door.  High and slender torches, made paler by theunmellowed dawn, cast their light over various countenances, hushed forthe moment in one solemn and intent expression.  And now there arose aslow and dismal music, which accorded sadly with the rite, and floatedfar along the desolate and breathless streets; while a chorus of femalevoices (the Praeficae so often cited by the Roman poets), accompanyingthe Tibicen and the Mysian flute, woke the following strain:               THE FUNERAL DIRGE      O\'er the sad threshold, where the cypress bough         Supplants the rose that should adorn thy home,       On the last pilgrimage on earth that now         Awaits thee, wanderer to Cocytus, come!       Darkly we woo, and weeping we invite--        Death is thy host--his banquet asks thy soul,       Thy garlands hang within the House of Night,         And the black stream alone shall fill thy bowl.      No more for thee the laughter and the song,         The jocund night--the glory of the day!       The Argive daughters\' at their labours long;         The hell-bird swooping on its Titan prey--      The false AEolides upheaving slow,         O\'er the eternal hill, the eternal stone;       The crowned Lydian, in his parching woe,         And green Callirrhoe\'s monster-headed son--      These shalt thou see, dim shadowed through the dark,         Which makes the sky of Pluto\'s dreary shore;       Lo! where thou stand\'st, pale-gazing on the bark,          That waits our rite to bear thee trembling o\'er!       Come, then! no more delay!--the phantom pines         Amidst the Unburied for its latest home;       O\'er the grey sky the torch impatient shines--        Come, mourner, forth!--the lost one bids thee come.As the hymn died away, the group parted in twain; and placed upon acouch, spread with a purple pall, the corpse of Apaecides was carriedforth, with the feet foremost.  The designator, or marshal of the sombreceremonial, accompanied by his torch-bearers, clad in black, gave thesignal, and the procession moved dreadly on.First went the musicians, playing a slow march--the solemnity of thelower instruments broken by many a louder and wilder burst of thefuneral trumpet: next followed the hired mourners, chanting their dirgesto the dead; and the female voices were mingled with those of boys,whose tender years made still more striking the contrast of life anddeath--the fresh leaf and the withered one.  But the players, thebuffoons, the archimimus (whose duty it was to personate thedead)--these, the customary attendants at ordinary funerals, werebanished from a funeral attended with so many terrible associations.The priests of Isis came next in their snowy garments, barefooted, andsupporting sheaves of corn; while before the corpse were carried theimages of the deceased and his many Athenian forefathers.  And behindthe bier followed, amidst her women, the sole surviving relative of thedead--her head bare, her locks disheveled, her face paler than marble,but composed and still, save ever and anon, as some tenderthought--awakened by the music, flashed upon the dark lethargy of woe,she covered that countenance with her hands, and sobbed unseen; for herswere not the noisy sorrow, the shrill lament, the ungoverned gesture,which characterized those who honored less faithfully.  In that age, asin all, the channel of deep grief flowed hushed and still.And so the procession swept on, till it had traversed the streets,passed the city gate, and gained the Place of Tombs without the wall,which the traveler yet beholds.Raised in the form of an altar--of unpolished pine, amidst whoseinterstices were placed preparations of combustible matter--stood thefuneral pyre; and around it drooped the dark and gloomy cypresses soconsecrated by song to the tomb.As soon as the bier was placed upon the pile, the attendants parting oneither side, Ione passed up to the couch, and stood before theunconscious clay for some moments motionless and silent. The features ofthe dead had been composed from the first agonized expression of violentdeath.  Hushed for ever the terror and the doubt, the contest ofpassion, the awe of religion, the struggle of the past and present, thehope and the horror of the future!--of all that racked and desolated thebreast of that young aspirant to the Holy of Life, what trace wasvisible in the awful serenity of that impenetrable brow and unbreathinglip?  The sister gazed, and not a sound was heard amidst the crowd;there was something terrible, yet softening, also, in the silence; andwhen it broke, it broke sudden and abrupt--it broke, with a loud andpassionate cry--the vent of long-smothered despair.\'My brother! my brother!\' cried the poor orphan, falling upon the couch;\'thou whom the worm on thy path feared not--what enemy couldst thouprovoke? Oh, is it in truth come to this?  Awake! awake! We grewtogether!  Are we thus torn asunder?  Thou art not dead--thou sleepest.Awake! awake!\'The sound of her piercing voice aroused the sympathy of the mourners,and they broke into loud and rude lament.  This startled, this recalledIone; she looked up hastily and confusedly, as if for the first timesensible of the presence of those around.\'Ah!\' she murmured with a shiver, \'we are not then alone!\' With that,after a brief pause, she rose; and her pale and beautiful countenancewas again composed and rigid.  With fond and trembling hands, sheunclosed the lids of the deceased; but when the dull glazed eye, nolonger beaming with love and life, met hers, she shrieked aloud, as ifshe had seen a spectre.  Once more recovering herself she kissed againand again the lids, the lips, the brow; and with mechanic andunconscious hand, received from the high priest of her brother\'s templethe funeral torch.The sudden burst of music, the sudden song of the mourners announced thebirth of the sanctifying flame.           HYMN TO THE WIND                I       On thy couch of cloud reclined,        Wake, O soft and sacred Wind!        Soft and sacred will we name thee,        Whosoe\'er the sire that claim thee--       Whether old Auster\'s dusky child,        Or the loud son of Eurus wild;        Or his who o\'er the darkling deeps,        From the bleak North, in tempest sweeps;        Still shalt thou seem as dear to us        As flowery-crowned Zephyrus,        When, through twilight\'s starry dew,        Trembling, he hastes his nymph to woo.                II       Lo! our silver censers swinging,        Perfumes o\'er thy path are flinging--       Ne\'er o\'er Tempe\'s breathless valleys,        Ne\'er o\'er Cypria\'s cedarn alleys,        Or the Rose-isle\'s moonlit sea,        Floated sweets more worthy thee.        Lo! around our vases sending        Myrrh and nard with cassia blending:        Paving air with odorous meet,        For thy silver-sandall\'d feet!               III       August and everlasting air!          The source of all that breathe and be,        From the mute clay before thee bear          The seeds it took from thee!        Aspire, bright Flame! aspire!          Wild wind!--awake, awake!        Thine own, O solemn Fire!          O Air, thine own retake!                IV       It comes! it comes! Lo! it sweeps,          The Wind we invoke the while!        And crackles, and darts, and leaps          The light on the holy pile!        It rises! its wings interweave        With the flames--how they howl and heave!            Toss\'d, whirl\'d to and fro,            How the flame-serpents glow!            Rushing higher and higher,            On--on, fearful Fire!            Thy giant limbs twined            With the arms of the Wind!        Lo! the elements meet on the throne        Of death--to reclaim their own!                 V       Swing, swing the censer round--       Tune the strings to a softer sound!        From the chains of thy earthly toil,        From the clasp of thy mortal coil,        From the prison where clay confined thee,        The hands of the flame unbind thee!            O Soul! thou art free--all free!        As the winds in their ceaseless chase,          When they rush o\'er their airy sea,        Thou mayst speed through the realms of space,          No fetter is forged for thee!        Rejoice! o\'er the sluggard tide        Of the Styx thy bark can glide,        And thy steps evermore shall rove        Through the glades of the happy grove;        Where, far from the loath\'d Cocytus,        The loved and the lost invite us.        Thou art slave to the earth no more!          O soul, thou art freed!--and we?--       Ah! when shall our toil be o\'er?          Ah! when shall we rest with thee?And now high and far into the dawning skies broke the fragrant fire; itflushed luminously across the gloomy cypresses--it shot above themassive walls of the neighboring city; and the early fisherman startedto behold the blaze reddening on the waves of the creeping sea.But Ione sat down apart and alone, and, leaning her face upon her hands,saw not the flame, nor heard the lamentation of the music: she felt onlyone sense of loneliness--she had not yet arrived to that hallowing senseof comfort, when we know that we are not alone--that the dead are withus!The breeze rapidly aided the effect of the combustibles placed withinthe pile.  By degrees the flame wavered, lowered, dimmed, and slowly, byfits and unequal starts, died away--emblem of life itself; where, justbefore, all was restlessness and flame, now lay the dull and smoulderingashes.The last sparks were extinguished by the attendants--the embers werecollected.  Steeped in the rarest wine and the costliest odorous, theremains were placed in a silver urn, which was solemnly stored in one ofthe neighboring sepulchres beside the road; and they placed within itthe vial full of tears, and the small coin which poetry stillconsecrated to the grim boatman.  And the sepulchre was covered withflowers and chaplets, and incense kindled on the altar, and the tombhung round with many lamps.But the next day, when the priest returned with fresh offerings to thetomb, he found that to the relics of heathen superstition some unknownhands had added a green palm-branch.  He suffered it to remain,unknowing that it was the sepulchral emblem of Christianity.When the above ceremonies were over, one of the Praeficae three timessprinkled the mourners from the purifying branch of laurel, uttering thelast word, \'Ilicet!\'--Depart!--and the rite was done.But first they paused to utter--weepingly and many times--the affectingfarewell, \'Salve Eternum!\' And as Ione yet lingered, they woke theparting strain.            SALVE ETERNUM                 I       Farewell! O soul departed!          Farewell! O sacred urn!        Bereaved and broken-hearted,          To earth the mourners turn.        To the dim and dreary shore,        Thou art gone our steps before!        But thither the swift Hours lead us,        And thou dost but a while precede us,                  Salve--salve!        Loved urn, and thou solemn cell,        Mute ashes!--farewell, farewell!                  Salve--salve!                II         Ilicet--ire licet--       Ah, vainly would we part!        Thy tomb is the faithful heart.        About evermore we bear thee;        For who from the heart can tear thee?        Vainly we sprinkle o\'er us          The drops of the cleansing stream;        And vainly bright before us          The lustral fire shall beam.        For where is the charm expelling        Thy thought from its sacred dwelling?        Our griefs are thy funeral feast,        And Memory thy mourning priest.                  Salve--salve!                III         Ilicet--ire licet!        The spark from the hearth is gone          Wherever the air shall bear it;        The elements take their own--         The shadows receive thy spirit.        It will soothe thee to feel our grief,          As thou glid\'st by the Gloomy River!        If love may in life be brief,          In death it is fixed for ever.                  Salve--salve!        In the hall which our feasts illume,        The rose for an hour may bloom;        But the cypress that decks the tomb--       The cypress is green for ever!                  Salve--salve!Chapter IXIN WHICH AN ADVENTURE HAPPENS TO IONE.WHILE some stayed behind to share with the priests the funeral banquet,Ione and her handmaids took homeward their melancholy way. And now (thelast duties to her brother performed) her mind awoke from itsabsorption, and she thought of her allianced, and the dread chargeagainst him.  Not--as we have before said--attaching even a momentarybelief to the unnatural accusation, but nursing the darkest suspicionagainst Arbaces, she felt that justice to her lover and to her murderedrelative demanded her to seek the praetor, and communicate herimpression, unsupported as it might be.  Questioning her maidens, whohad hitherto--kindly anxious, as I have said, to save her the additionalagony--refrained from informing her of the state of Glaucus, she learnedthat he had been dangerously ill: that he was in custody, under the roofof Sallust; that the day of his trial was appointed.\'Averting gods,\' she exclaimed; \'and have I been so long forgetful ofhim? Have I seemed to shun him?  O! let me hasten to do him justice--toshow that I, the nearest relative of the dead, believe him innocent ofthe charge. Quick! quick! let us fly.  Let me soothe--tend--cheer him!and if they will not believe me; if they will not lead to my conviction;if they sentence him to exile or to death, let me share the sentencewith him!\'Instinctively she hastened her pace, confused and bewildered, scarceknowing whither she went; now designing first to seek the praetor, andnow to rush to the chamber of Glaucus.  She hurried on--she passed thegate of the city--she was in the long street leading up the town.  Thehouses were opened, but none were yet astir in the streets; the life ofthe city was scarce awake--when lo! she came suddenly upon a small knotof men standing beside a covered litter. A tall figure stepped from themidst of them, and Ione shrieked aloud to behold Arbaces.\'Fair Ione!\' said he, gently, and appearing not to heed her alarm: \'myward, my pupil! forgive me if I disturb thy pious sorrows; but thepraetor, solicitous of thy honour, and anxious that thou mayest notrashly be implicated in the coming trial; knowing the strangeembarrassment of thy state (seeking justice for thy brother, butdreading punishment to thy betrothed)--sympathizing, too, with thyunprotected and friendless condition, and deeming it harsh that thoushouldst be suffered to act unguided and mourn alone--hath wisely andpaternally confided thee to the care of thy lawful guardian. Behold thewriting which intrusts thee to my charge!\'\'Dark Egyptian!\' cried Ione, drawing herself proudly aside; \'begone!  Itis thou that hast slain my brother!  Is it to thy care, thy hands yetreeking with his blood, that they will give the sister Ha! thou turnestpale! thy conscience smites thee! thou tremblest at the thunderbolt ofthe avenging god!  Pass on, and leave me to my woe!\'\'Thy sorrows unstring thy reason, Ione,\' said Arbaces, attempting invain his usual calmness of tone.  \'I forgive thee.  Thou wilt find menow, as ever, thy surest friend.  But the public streets are not thefitting place for us to confer--for me to console thee. Approach,slaves!  Come, my sweet charge, the litter awaits thee.\'The amazed and terrified attendants gathered round Ione, and clung toher knees.\'Arbaces,\' said the eldest of the maidens, \'this is surely not the law!For nine days after the funeral, is it not written that the relatives ofthe deceased shall not be molested in their homes, or interrupted intheir solitary grief?\'\'Woman!\' returned Arbaces, imperiously waving his hand, \'to place a wardunder the roof of her guardian is not against the funeral laws.  I tellthee I have the fiat of the praetor.  This delay is indecorous.  Placeher in the litter.\'So saying, he threw his arm firmly round the shrinking form of Ione.She drew back, gazed earnestly in his face, and then burst intohysterical laughter:\'Ha, ha! this is well--well!  Excellent guardian--paternal law!  Ha,ha!\' And, startled herself at the dread echo of that shrill and maddenedlaughter, she sunk, as it died away, lifeless upon the ground...  Aminute more, and Arbaces had lifted her into the litter. The bearersmoved swiftly on, and the unfortunate Ione was soon borne from the sightof her weeping handmaids.Chapter XWHAT BECOMES OF NYDIA IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES.  THE EGYPTIAN FEELSCOMPASSION FOR GLAUCUS.  COMPASSION IS OFTEN A VERY USELESS VISITOR TOTHE GUILTY.IT will be remembered that, at the command of Arbaces, Nydia followedthe Egyptian to his home, and conversing there with her, he learned fromthe confession of her despair and remorse, that her hand, and notJulia\'s, had administered to Glaucus the fatal potion.  At another timethe Egyptian might have conceived a philosophical interest in soundingthe depths and origin of the strange and absorbing passion which, inblindness and in slavery, this singular girl had dared to cherish; butat present he spared no thought from himself.  As, after her confession,the poor Nydia threw herself on her knees before him, and besought himto restore the health and save the life of Glaucus--for in her youth andignorance she imagined the dark magician all-powerful to effectboth--Arbaces, with unheeding ears, was noting only the new expediency ofdetaining Nydia a prisoner until the trial and fate of Glaucus weredecided.  For if, when he judged her merely the accomplice of Julia inobtaining the philtre, he had felt it was dangerous to the full successof his vengeance to allow her to be at large--to appear, perhaps, as awitness--to avow the manner in which the sense of Glaucus had beendarkened, and thus win indulgence to the crime of which he wasaccused--how much more was she likely to volunteer her testimony whenshe herself had administered the draught, and, inspired by love, wouldbe only anxious, at any expense of shame, to retrieve her error andpreserve her beloved?  Besides, how unworthy of the rank and repute ofArbaces to be implicated in the disgrace of pandering to the passion ofJulia, and assisting in the unholy rites of the Saga of Vesuvius!Nothing less, indeed, than his desire to induce Glaucus to own themurder of Apaecides, as a policy evidently the best both for his ownpermanent safety and his successful suit with Ione, could ever have ledhim to contemplate the confession of Julia.As for Nydia, who was necessarily cut off by her blindness from much ofthe knowledge of active life, and who, a slave and a stranger, wasnaturally ignorant of the perils of the Roman law, she thought rather ofthe illness and delirium of her Athenian, than the crime of which shehad vaguely heard him accused, or the chances of the impending trial.Poor wretch that she was, whom none addressed, none cared for, what didshe know of the senate and the sentence--the hazard of the law--theferocity of the people--the arena and the lion\'s den?  She wasaccustomed only to associate with the thought of Glaucus everything thatwas prosperous and lofty--she could not imagine that any peril, savefrom the madness of her love, could menace that sacred head.  He seemedto her set apart for the blessings of life.  She only had disturbed thecurrent of his felicity; she knew not, she dreamed not that the stream,once so bright, was dashing on to darkness and to death.  It wastherefore to restore the brain that she had marred, to save the lifethat she had endangered that she implored the assistance of the greatEgyptian.\'Daughter,\' said Arbaces, waking from his reverie, \'thou must rest here;it is not meet for thee to wander along the streets, and be spurned fromthe threshold by the rude feet of slaves.  I have compassion on thy softcrime--I will do all to remedy it.  Wait here patiently for some days,and Glaucus shall be restored.\' So saying, and without waiting for herreply, he hastened from the room, drew the bolt across the door, andconsigned the care and wants of his prisoner to the slave who had thecharge of that part of the mansion.Alone, then, and musingly, he waited the morning light, and with itrepaired, as we have seen, to possess himself of the person of Ione.His primary object, with respect to the unfortunate Neapolitan, was thatwhich he had really stated to Clodius, viz., to prevent her interestingherself actively in the trial of Glaucus, and also to guard against heraccusing him (which she would, doubtless, have done) of his former actof perfidy and violence towards her, his ward--denouncing his causes forvengeance against Glaucus--unveiling the hypocrisy of his character--andcasting any doubt upon his veracity in the charge which he had madeagainst the Athenian.  Not till he had encountered her that morning--nottill he had heard her loud denunciations--was he aware that he had alsoanother danger to apprehend in her suspicion of his crime.  He huggedhimself now at the thought that these ends were effected: that one, atonce the object of his passion and his fear, was in his power.  Hebelieved more than ever the flattering promises of the stars; and whenhe sought Ione in that chamber in the inmost recesses of his mysteriousmansion to which he had consigned her--when he found her overpowered byblow upon blow, and passing from fit to fit, from violence to torpor, inall the alternations of hysterical disease--he thought more of theloveliness which no frenzy could distort than of the woe which he hadbrought upon her.  In that sanguine vanity common to men who throughlife have been invariably successful, whether in fortune or love, heflattered himself that when Glaucus had perished--when his name wassolemnly blackened by the award of a legal judgment, his title to herlove for ever forfeited by condemnation to death for the murder of herown brother--her affection would be changed to horror; and that histenderness and his passion, assisted by all the arts with which he wellknew how to dazzle woman\'s imagination, might elect him to that thronein her heart from which his rival would be so awfully expelled.  Thiswas his hope: but should it fail, his unholy and fervid passionwhispered, \'At the worst, now she is in my power.\'Yet, withal, he felt that uneasiness and apprehension which attendedupon the chance of detection, even when the criminal is insensible tothe voice of conscience--that vague terror of the consequences of crime,which is often mistaken for remorse at the crime itself.  The buoyantair of Campania weighed heavily upon his breast; he longed to hurry froma scene where danger might not sleep eternally with the dead; and,having Ione now in his possession, he secretly resolved, as soon as hehad witnessed the last agony of his rival, to transport his wealth--andher, the costliest treasure of all, to some distant shore.\'Yes,\' said he, striding to and fro his solitary chamber--\'yes, the lawthat gave me the person of my ward gives me the possession of my bride.Far across the broad main will we sweep on our search after novelluxuries and inexperienced pleasures.  Cheered by my stars, supported bythe omens of my soul, we will penetrate to those vast and gloriousworlds which my wisdom tells me lie yet untracked in the recesses of thecircling sea.  There may this heart, possessed of love, grow once morealive to ambition--there, amongst nations uncrushed by the Roman yoke,and to whose ear the name of Rome has not yet been wafted, I may foundan empire, and transplant my ancestral creed; renewing the ashes of thedead Theban rule; continuing in yet grander shores the dynasty of mycrowned fathers, and waking in the noble heart of Ione the gratefulconsciousness that she shares the lot of one who, far from the agedrottenness of this slavish civilization, restores the primal elements ofgreatness, and unites in one mighty soul the attributes of the prophetand the king.\' From this exultant soliloquy, Arbaces was awakened toattend the trial of the Athenian.The worn and pallid cheek of his victim touched him less than thefirmness of his nerves and the dauntlessness of his brow; for Arbaceswas one who had little pity for what was unfortunate, but a strongsympathy for what was bold.  The congenialities that bind us to othersever assimilate to the qualities of our own nature.  The hero weeps lessat the reverses of his enemy than at the fortitude with which he bearsthem.  All of us are human, and Arbaces, criminal as he was, had hisshare of our common feelings and our mother clay. Had he but obtainedfrom Glaucus the written confession of his crime, which would, betterthan even the judgment of others, have lost him with Ione, and removedfrom Arbaces the chance of future detection, the Egyptian would havestrained every nerve to save his rival.  Even now his hatred wasover--his desire of revenge was slaked: he crushed his prey, not inenmity, but as an obstacle in his path. Yet was he not the lessresolved, the less crafty and persevering, in the course he pursued, forthe destruction of one whose doom was become necessary to the attainmentof his objects: and while, with apparent reluctance and compassion, hegave against Glaucus the evidence which condemned him, he secretly, andthrough the medium of the priesthood, fomented that popular indignationwhich made an effectual obstacle to the pity of the senate.  He hadsought Julia; he had detailed to her the confession of Nydia; he hadeasily, therefore, lulled any scruple of conscience which might have ledher to extenuate the offence of Glaucus by avowing her share in hisfrenzy: and the more readily, for her vain heart had loved the fame andthe prosperity of Glaucus--not Glaucus himself, she felt no affectionfor a disgraced man--nay, she almost rejoiced in the disgrace thathumbled the hated Ione.  If Glaucus could not be her slave, neithercould he be the adorer of her rival.  This was sufficient consolationfor any regret at his fate.  Volatile and fickle, she began again to bemoved by the sudden and earnest suit of Clodius, and was not willing tohazard the loss of an alliance with that base but high-born noble by anypublic exposure of her past weakness and immodest passion for another.All things then smiled upon Arbaces--all things frowned upon theAthenian.Chapter XINYDIA AFFECTS THE SORCERESS.WHEN the Thessalian found that Arbaces returned to her no more--when shewas left, hour after hour, to all the torture of that miserable suspensewhich was rendered by blindness doubly intolerable, she began, withoutstretched arms, to feel around her prison for some channel of escape;and finding the only entrance secure, she called aloud, and with thevehemence of a temper naturally violent, and now sharpened by impatientagony.\'Ho, girl!\' said the slave in attendance, opening the door; art thou bitby a scorpion? or thinkest thou that we are dying of silence here, andonly to be preserved, like the infant Jupiter, by a hullabaloo?\'\'Where is thy master? and wherefore am I caged here?  I want air andliberty: let me go forth!\'\'Alas! little one, hast thou not seen enough of Arbaces to know that hiswill is imperial!  He hath ordered thee to be caged; and caged thou art,and I am thy keeper.  Thou canst not have air and liberty; but thoumayst have what are much better things--food and wine.\'\'Proh Jupiter!\' cried the girl, wringing her hands; \'and why am I thusimprisoned?  What can the great Arbaces want with so poor a thing as Iam?\'\'That I know not, unless it be to attend on thy new mistress, who hasbeen brought hither this day.\'\'What! Ione here?\'\'Yes, poor lady; she liked it little, I fear.  Yet, by the Temple ofCastor! Arbaces is a gallant man to the women.  Thy lady is his ward,thou knowest.\'\'Wilt thou take me to her?\'\'She is ill--frantic with rage and spite.  Besides, I have no orders todo so; and I never think for myself.  When Arbaces made me slave ofthese chambers, he said, ""I have but one lesson to give thee--while thouservest me, thou must have neither ears, eyes, nor thought; thou must bebut one quality--obedience.""\'\'But what harm is there in seeing Ione?\'\'That I know not; but if thou wantest a companion, I am willing to talkto thee, little one, for I am solitary enough in my dull cubiculum.And, by the way, thou art Thessalian--knowest thou not some cunningamusement of knife and shears, some pretty trick of telling fortunes, asmost of thy race do, in order to pass the time.\'\'Tush, slave, hold thy peace! or, if thou wilt speak, what hast thouheard of the state of Glaucus?\'\'Why, my master has gone to the Athenian\'s trial; Glaucus will smart forit!\'\'For what?\'\'The murder of the priest Apaecides.\'\'Ha!\' said Nydia, pressing her hands to her forehead; \'something of thisI have indeed heard, but understand not.  Yet, who will dare to touch ahair of his head?\'\'That will the lion, I fear.\'\'Averting gods! what wickedness dost thou utter?\'\'Why, only that, if he be found guilty, the lion, or may be the tiger,will be his executioner.\'Nydia leaped up, as if an arrow had entered her heart; she uttered apiercing scream; then, falling before the feet of the slave, she cried,in a tone that melted even his rude heart:\'Ah! tell me thou jestest--thou utterest not the truth--speak, speak!\'\'Why, by my faith, blind girl, I know nothing of the law; it may not beso bad as I say.  But Arbaces is his accuser, and the people desire avictim for the arena.  Cheer thee! But what hath the fate of theAthenian to do with thine?\'\'No matter, no matter--he has been kind to me: thou knowest not, then,what they will do?  Arbaces his accuser!  O fate!  The people--thepeople!  Ah! they can look upon his face--who will be cruel to theAthenian!--Yet was not Love itself cruel to him?\'So saying, her head drooped upon her bosom: she sunk into silence;scalding tears flowed down her cheeks; and all the kindly efforts of theslave were unable either to console her or distract the absorption ofher reverie.When his household cares obliged the ministrant to leave her room, Nydiabegan to re-collect her thoughts.  Arbaces was the accuser of Glaucus;Arbaces had imprisoned her here; was not that a proof that her libertymight be serviceable to Glaucus?  Yes, she was evidently inveigled intosome snare; she was contributing to the destruction of her beloved!  Oh,how she panted for release!  Fortunately, for her sufferings, all senseof pain became merged in the desire of escape; and as she began torevolve the possibility of deliverance, she grew calm and thoughtful.She possessed much of the craft of her sex, and it had been increased inher breast by her early servitude.  What slave was ever destitute ofcunning?  She resolved to practise upon her keeper; and calling suddenlyto mind his superstitious query as to her Thessalian art, she hoped bythat handle to work out some method of release.  These doubts occupiedher mind during the rest of the day and the long hours of night; and,accordingly, when Sosia visited her the following morning, she hastenedto divert his garrulity into that channel in which it had before evinceda natural disposition to flow.She was aware, however, that her only chance of escape was at night; andaccordingly she was obliged with a bitter pang at the delay to defertill then her purposed attempt.\'The night,\' said she, \'is the sole time in which we can well decipherthe decrees of Fate--then it is thou must seek me.  But what desirestthou to learn?\'\'By Pollux! I should like to know as much as my master; but that is notto be expected.  Let me know, at least, whether I shall save enough topurchase my freedom, or whether this Egyptian will give it me fornothing.  He does such generous things sometimes.  Next, supposing thatbe true, shall I possess myself of that snug taberna among theMyropolia, which I have long had in my eye?  \'Tis a genteel trade thatof a perfumer, and suits a retired slave who has something of agentleman about him!\'\'Ay! so you would have precise answers to those questions?--there arevarious ways of satisfying you.  There is the Lithomanteia, orSpeaking-stone, which answers your prayer with an infant\'s voice; but,then, we have not that precious stone with us--costly is it and rare.Then there is the Gastromanteia, whereby the demon casts pale and deadlyimages upon the water, prophetic of the future.  But this art requiresalso glasses of a peculiar fashion, to contain the consecrated liquid,which we have not.  I think, therefore, that the simplest method ofsatisfying your desire would be by the Magic of Air.\'\'I trust,\' said Sosia, tremulously, \'that there is nothing veryfrightful in the operation?  I have no love for apparitions.\'\'Fear not; thou wilt see nothing; thou wilt only hear by the bubbling ofwater whether or not thy suit prospers.  First, then, be sure, from therising of the evening star, that thou leavest the garden-gate somewhatopen, so that the demon may feel himself invited to enter therein; andplace fruits and water near the gate as a sign of hospitality; then,three hours after twilight, come here with a bowl of the coldest andpurest water, and thou shalt learn all, according to the Thessalian loremy mother taught me. But forget not the garden-gate--all rests uponthat: it must be open when you come, and for three hours previously.\'\'Trust me,\' replied the unsuspecting Sosia; \'I know what a gentleman\'sfeelings are when a door is shut in his face, as the cookshop\'s hathbeen in mine many a day; and I know, also, that a person ofrespectability, as a demon of course is, cannot but be pleased, on theother hand, with any little mark of courteous hospitality.  Meanwhile,pretty one, here is thy morning\'s meal.\'\'But what of the trial?\'\'Oh, the lawyers are still at it--talk, talk--it will last over allto-morrow.\'\'To-morrow?  You are sure of that?\'\'So I hear.\'\'And Ione?\'\'By Bacchus! she must be tolerably well, for she was strong enough tomake my master stamp and bite his lip this morning.  I saw him quit herapartment with a brow like a thunderstorm.\'\'Lodges she near this?\'\'No--in the upper apartments.  But I must not stay prating here longer.Vale!\'Chapter XIIA WASP VENTURES INTO THE SPIDER\'S WEB.THE second night of the trial had set in; and it was nearly the time inwhich Sosia was to brave the dread Unknown, when there entered, at thatvery garden-gate which the slave had left ajar--not, indeed, one of themysterious spirits of earth or air, but the heavy and most human form ofCalenus, the priest of Isis.  He scarcely noted the humble offerings ofindifferent fruit, and still more indifferent wine, which the piousSosia had deemed good enough for the invisible stranger they wereintended to allure.  \'Some tribute,\' thought he, \'to the garden god.  Bymy father\'s head! if his deityship were never better served, he would dowell to give up the godly profession.  Ah! were it not for us priests,the gods would have a sad time of it.  And now for Arbaces--I amtreading a quicksand, but it ought to cover a mine.  I have theEgyptian\'s life in my power--what will he value it at?\'As he thus soliloquised, he crossed through the open court into theperistyle, where a few lamps here and there broke upon the empire of thestarlit night; and issuing from one of the chambers that bordered thecolonnade, suddenly encountered Arbaces.\'Ho! Calenus--seekest thou me?\' said the Egyptian; and there was alittle embarrassment in his voice.\'Yes, wise Arbaces--I trust my visit is not unseasonable?\'\'Nay--it was but this instant that my freedman Callias sneezed thrice atmy right hand; I knew, therefore, some good fortune was in store forme--and, lo! the gods have sent me Calenus.\'\'Shall we within to your chamber, Arbaces?\'\'As you will; but the night is clear and balmy--I have some remains oflanguor yet lingering on me from my recent illness--the air refreshesme--let us walk in the garden--we are equally alone there.\'\'With all my heart,\' answered the priest; and the two friends passedslowly to one of the many terraces which, bordered by marble vases andsleeping flowers, intersected the garden.\'It is a lovely night,\' said Arbaces--\'blue and beautiful as that onwhich, twenty years ago, the shores of Italy first broke upon my view.My Calenus, age creeps upon us--let us, at least, feel that we havelived.\'\'Thou, at least, mayst arrogate that boast,\' said Calenus, beatingabout, as it were, for an opportunity to communicate the secret whichweighed upon him, and feeling his usual awe of Arbaces still moreimpressively that night, from the quiet and friendly tone of dignifiedcondescension which the Egyptian assumed--\'Thou, at least, maystarrogate that boast.  Thou hast had countless wealth--a frame on whoseclose-woven fibres disease can find no space to enter--prosperouslove--inexhaustible pleasure--and, even at this hour, triumphantrevenge.\'\'Thou alludest to the Athenian.  Ay, to-morrow\'s sun the fiat of hisdeath will go forth.  The senate does not relent.  But thou mistakest:his death gives me no other gratification than that it releases me froma rival in the affections of Ione.  I entertain no other sentiment ofanimosity against that unfortunate homicide.\'\'Homicide!\' repeated Calenus, slowly and meaningly; and, halting as hespoke, he fixed his eyes upon Arbaces.  The stars shone pale andsteadily on the proud face of their prophet, but they betrayed there nochange: the eyes of Calenus fell disappointed and abashed.  He continuedrapidly--\'Homicide! it is well to charge him with that crime; but thou,of all men, knowest that he is innocent.\'\'Explain thyself,\' said Arbaces, coldly; for he had prepared himself forthe hint his secret fears had foretold.\'Arbaces,\' answered Calenus, sinking his voice into a whisper, \'I was inthe sacred grove, sheltered by the chapel and the surrounding foliage.I overheard--I marked the whole.  I saw thy weapon pierce the heart ofApaecides.  I blame not the deed--it destroyed a foe and an apostate.\'\'Thou sawest the whole!\' said Arbaces, dryly; \'so I imagined--thou wertalone.\'\'Alone!\' returned Calenus, surprised at the Egyptian\'s calmness.\'And wherefore wert thou hid behind the chapel at that hour?\'\'Because I had learned the conversion of Apaecides to the Christianfaith--because I knew that on that spot he was to meet the fierceOlinthus--because they were to meet there to discuss plans for unveilingthe sacred mysteries of our goddess to the people--and I was there todetect, in order to defeat them.\'\'Hast thou told living ear what thou didst witness?\'\'No, my master: the secret is locked in thy servant\'s breast.\'\'What! even thy kinsman Burbo guesses it not!  Come, the truth!\'\'By the gods...\'\'Hush! we know each other--what are the gods to us?\'\'By the fear of thy vengeance, then--no!\'\'And why hast thou hitherto concealed from me this secret?  Why hastthou waited till the eve of the Athenian\'s condemnation before thou hastventured to tell me that Arbaces is a murderer?  And having tarried solong, why revealest thou now that knowledge?\'\'Because--because...\' stammered Calenus, coloring and in confusion.\'Because,\' interrupted Arbaces, with a gentle smile, and tapping thepriest on the shoulder with a kindly and familiar gesture--\'because,my Calenus (see now, I will read thy heart, and explain itsmotives)--because thou didst wish thoroughly to commit and entangle mein the trial, so that I might have no loophole of escape; that I mightstand firmly pledged to perjury and to malice, as well as to homicide;that having myself whetted the appetite of the populace to blood, nowealth, no power, could prevent my becoming their victim: and thoutellest me thy secret now, ere the trial be over and the innocentcondemned, to show what a desperate web of villainy thy word to-morrowcould destroy; to enhance in this, the ninth hour, the price of thyforbearance; to show that my own arts, in arousing the popular wrath,would, at thy witness, recoil upon myself; and that if not for Glaucus,for me would gape the jaws of the lion! Is it not so?\'\'Arbaces, replied Calenus, losing all the vulgar audacity of his naturalcharacter, \'verily thou art a Magician; thou readest the heart as itwere a scroll.\'\'It is my vocation,\' answered the Egyptian, laughing gently. \'Well,then, forbear; and when all is over, I will make thee rich.\'\'Pardon me,\' said the priest, as the quick suggestion of that avarice,which was his master-passion, bade him trust no future chance ofgenerosity; \'pardon me; thou saidst right--we know each other.  If thouwouldst have me silent, thou must pay something in advance, as an offerto Harpocrates.\' If the rose, sweet emblem of discretion, is to takeroot firmly, water her this night with a stream of gold.\'\'Witty and poetical!\' answered Arbaces, still in that bland voice whichlulled and encouraged, when it ought to have alarmed and checked, hisgriping comrade.  \'Wilt thou not wait the morrow?\'\'Why this delay?  Perhaps, when I can no longer give my testimonywithout shame for not having given it ere the innocent man suffered,thou wilt forget my claim; and, indeed, thy present hesitation is a badomen of thy future gratitude.\'\'Well, then, Calenus, what wouldst thou have me pay thee?\'\'Thy life is, very precious, and thy wealth is very great,\' returned thepriest, grinning.\'Wittier and more witty.  But speak out--what shall be the sum?\'\'Arbaces, I have heard that in thy secret treasury below, beneath thoserude Oscan arches which prop thy stately halls, thou hast piles of gold,of vases, and of jewels, which might rival the receptacles of the wealthof the deified Nero.  Thou mayst easily spare out of those piles enoughto make Calenus among the richest priests of Pompeii, and yet not missthe loss.\'\'Come, Calenus,\' said Arbaces, winningly, and with a frank and generousair, \'thou art an old friend, and hast been a faithful servant.  Thoucanst have no wish to take away my life, nor I a desire to stint thyreward: thou shalt descend with me to that treasury thou referrest to,thou shalt feast thine eyes with the blaze of uncounted gold and thesparkle of priceless gems; and thou shalt for thy own reward, bear awaywith thee this night as much as thou canst conceal beneath thy robes.Nay, when thou hast once seen what thy friend possesses, thou wilt learnhow foolish it would be to injure one who has so much to bestow.  WhenGlaucus is no more, thou shalt pay the treasury another visit.  Speak Ifrankly and as a friend?\'\'Oh, greatest, best of men!\' cried Calenus, almost weeping with joy,\'canst thou thus forgive my injurious doubts of thy justice, thygenerosity?\'\'Hush! one other turn and we will descend to the Oscan arches.\'Chapter XIIITHE SLAVE CONSULTS THE ORACLE.  THEY WHO BLIND THEMSELVES THE BLIND MAYFOOL.  TWO NEW PRISONERS MADE IN ONE NIGHT.IMPATIENTLY Nydia awaited the arrival of the no less anxious Sosia.Fortifying his courage by plentiful potations of a better liquor thanthat provided for the demon, the credulous ministrant stole into theblind girl\'s chamber.\'Well, Sosia, and art thou prepared?  Hast thou the bowl of pure water?\'\'Verily, yes: but I tremble a little.  You are sure I shall not see thedemon?  I have heard that those gentlemen are by no means of a handsomeperson or a civil demeanor.\'\'Be assured!  And hast thou left the garden-gate gently open?\'\'Yes; and placed some beautiful nuts and apples on a little table closeby?\'\'That\'s well.  And the gate is open now, so that the demon may passthrough it?\'\'Surely it is.\'\'Well, then, open this door; there--leave it just ajar.  And now, Sosia,give me the lamp.\'\'What, you will not extinguish it?\'\'No; but I must breathe my spell over its ray.  There is a spirit infire. Seat thyself.\'The slave obeyed; and Nydia, after bending for some moments silentlyover the lamp, rose, and in a low voice chanted the following rude:--     INVOCATION TO THE SPECTRE OF THE AIR       Loved alike by Air and Water        Aye must be Thessalia\'s daughter;        To us, Olympian hearts, are given        Spells that draw the moon from heaven.          All that Egypt\'s learning wrought--        All that Persia\'s Magian taught--       Won from song, or wrung from flowers,        Or whisper\'d low by fiend--are ours.       Spectre of the viewless air!        Hear the blind Thessalian\'s prayer!        By Erictho\'s art, that shed        Dews of life when life was fled--       By lone Ithaca\'s wise king,        Who could wake the crystal spring        To the voice of prophecy?        By the lost Eurydice,        Summon\'d from the shadowy throng,        As the muse-son\'s magic song--       By the Colchian\'s awful charms,        When fair-haired Jason left her arms--       Spectre of the airy halls,        One who owns thee duly calls!        Breathe along the brimming bowl,        And instruct the fearful soul        In the shadowy things that lie        Dark in dim futurity.        Come, wild demon of the air,        Answer to thy votary\'s prayer!          Come! oh, come!       And no god on heaven or earth--       Not the Paphian Queen of Mirth,        Not the vivid Lord of Light,        Nor the triple Maid of Night,        Nor the Thunderer\'s self shall be        Blest and honour\'d more than thee!          Come! oh, come!\'The spectre is certainly coming,\' said Sosia.  \'I feel him runningalong my hair!\'\'Place thy bowl of water on the ground.  Now, then, give me thy napkin,and let me fold up thy face and eyes.\'\'Ay! that\'s always the custom with these charms.  Not so tight, though:gently--gently!\'\'There--thou canst not see?\'\'See, by Jupiter!  No!  nothing but darkness.\'\'Address, then, to the spectre whatever question thou wouldst ask him,in a low-whispered voice, three times.  If thy question is answered inthe affirmative, thou wilt hear the water ferment and bubble before thedemon breathes upon it; if in the negative, the water will be quitesilent.\'\'But you will not play any trick with the water, eh?\'\'Let me place the bowl under thy feet--so.  Now thou wilt perceive thatI cannot touch it without thy knowledge.\'\'Very fair.  Now, then, O Bacchus! befriend me.  Thou knowest that Ihave always loved thee better than all the other gods, and I willdedicate to thee that silver cup I stole last year from the burlycarptor (butler), if thou wilt but befriend me with this water-lovingdemon.  And thou, O Spirit! listen and hear me.  Shall I be enabled topurchase my freedom next year? Thou knowest; for, as thou livest in theair, the birds have doubtless acquainted thee with every secret of thishouse,--thou knowest that I have filched and pilfered all that Ihonestly--that is, safely--could lay finger upon for the last threeyears, and I yet want two thousand sesterces of the full sum.  Shall Ibe able, O good Spirit! to make up the deficiency in the course of thisyear?  Speak--Ha! does the water bubble?  No; all is as still as atomb.--Well, then, if not this year, in two years?--Ah! I hearsomething; the demon is scratching at the door; he\'ll be herepresently.--In two years, my good fellow: come now, two; that\'s a veryreasonable time. What! dumb still!  Two years and a half--three--four?ill fortune to you, friend demon!  You are not a lady, that\'s clear, oryou would not keep silence so long.  Five--six--sixty years? and mayPluto seize you!  I\'ll ask no more.\' And Sosia, in a rage, kicked downthe water over his legs.  He then, after much fumbling and more cursing,managed to extricate his head from the napkin in which it was completelyfolded--stared round--and discovered that he was in the dark.\'What, ho! Nydia; the lamp is gone.  Ah, traitress; and thou art gonetoo; but I\'ll catch thee--thou shalt smart for this!\' The slave gropedhis way to the door; it was bolted from without: he was a prisonerinstead of Nydia. What could he do?  He did not dare to knock loud--tocall out--lest Arbaces should overhear him, and discover how he had beenduped; and Nydia, meanwhile, had probably already gained thegarden-gate, and was fast on her escape.\'But,\' thought he, \'she will go home, or, at least, be somewhere in thecity.  To-morrow, at dawn, when the slaves are at work in the peristyle,I can make myself heard; then I can go forth and seek her.  I shall besure to find and bring her back, before Arbaces knows a word of thematter.  Ah! that\'s the best plan.  Little traitress, my fingers itch atthee: and to leave only a bowl of water, too!  Had it been wine, itwould have been some comfort.\'While Sosia, thus entrapped, was lamenting his fate, and revolving hisschemes to repossess himself of Nydia, the blind girl, with thatsingular precision and dexterous rapidity of motion, which, we havebefore observed, was peculiar to her, had passed lightly along theperistyle, threaded the opposite passage that led into the garden, and,with a beating heart, was about to proceed towards the gate, when shesuddenly heard the sound of approaching steps, and distinguished thedreaded voice of Arbaces himself. She paused for a moment in doubt andterror; then suddenly it flashed across her recollection that there wasanother passage which was little used except for the admission of thefair partakers of the Egyptian\'s secret revels, and which wound alongthe basement of that massive fabric towards a door which alsocommunicated with the garden.  By good fortune it might be open.  Atthat thought, she hastily retraced her steps, descended the narrowstairs at the right, and was soon at the entrance of the passage.  Alas!the door at the entrance was closed and secured. While she was yetassuring herself that it was indeed locked, she heard behind her thevoice of Calenus, and, a moment after, that of Arbaces in low reply.She could not stay there; they were probably passing to that very door.She sprang onward, and felt herself in unknown ground.  The air grewdamp and chill; this reassured her. She thought she might be among thecellars of the luxurious mansion, or, at least, in some rude spot notlikely to be visited by its haughty lord, when again her quick earcaught steps and the sound of voices. On, on, she hurried, extending herarms, which now frequently encountered pillars of thick and massiveform.  With a tact, doubled in acuteness by her fear, she escaped theseperils, and continued her way, the air growing more and more damp as sheproceeded; yet, still, as she ever and anon paused for breath, she heardthe advancing steps and the indistinct murmur of voices.  At length shewas abruptly stopped by a wall that seemed the limit of her path. Wasthere no spot in which she could hide?  No aperture? no cavity?  Therewas none!  She stopped, and wrung her hands in despair; then again,nerved as the voices neared upon her, she hurried on by the side of thewall; and coming suddenly against one of the sharp buttresses that hereand there jutted boldly forth, she fell to the ground.  Though muchbruised, her senses did not leave her; she uttered no cry; nay, shehailed the accident that had led her to something like a screen; andcreeping close up to the angle formed by the buttress, so that on oneside at least she was sheltered from view, she gathered her slight andsmall form into its smallest compass, and breathlessly awaited her fate.Meanwhile Arbaces and the priest were taking their way to that secretchamber whose stores were so vaunted by the Egyptian.  They were in avast subterranean atrium, or hall; the low roof was supported by short,thick pillars of an architecture far remote from the Grecian graces ofthat luxuriant period.  The single and pale lamp, which Arbaces bore,shed but an imperfect ray over the bare and rugged walls, in which thehuge stones, without cement, were fitted curiously and uncouthly intoeach other.  The disturbed reptiles glared dully on the intruders, andthen crept into the shadow of the walls.Calenus shivered as he looked around and breathed the damp, unwholesomeair.\'Yet,\' said Arbaces, with a smile, perceiving his shudder, \'it is theserude abodes that furnish the luxuries of the halls above. They are likethe laborers of the world--we despise their ruggedness, yet they feedthe very pride that disdains them.\'\'And whither goes yon dim gallery to the left asked Calenus; \'in thisdepth of gloom it seems without limit, as if winding into Hades.\'\'On the contrary, it does but conduct to the upper rooms,\' answeredArbaces, carelessly: \'it is to the right that we steer to our bourn.\'The hall, like many in the more habitable regions of Pompeii, branchedoff at the extremity into two wings or passages; the length of which,not really great, was to the eye considerably exaggerated by the suddengloom against which the lamp so faintly struggled.  To the right ofthese alae, the two comrades now directed their steps.\'The gay Glaucus will be lodged to-morrow in apartments not much drier,and far less spacious than this,\' said Calenus, as they passed by thevery spot where, completely wrapped in the shadow of the broad,projecting buttress, cowered the Thessalian.\'Ay, but then he will have dry room, and ample enough, in the arena onthe following day.  And to think,\' continued Arbaces, slowly, and verydeliberately--\'to think that a word of thine could save him, and consignArbaces to his doom!\'\'That word shall never be spoken,\' said Calenus.\'Right, my Calenus! it never shall,\' returned Arbaces, familiarlyleaning his arm on the priest\'s shoulder: \'and now, halt--we are at thedoor.\'The light trembled against a small door deep set in the wall, andguarded strongly by many plates and bindings of iron, that intersectedthe rough and dark wood.  From his girdle Arbaces now drew a small ring,holding three or four short but strong keys.  Oh, how beat the gripingheart of Calenus, as he heard the rusty wards growl, as if resenting theadmission to the treasures they guarded!\'Enter, my friend,\' said Arbaces, \'while I hold the lamp on high, thatthou mayst glut thine eyes on the yellow heaps.\'The impatient Calenus did not wait to be twice invited; he hastenedtowards the aperture.Scarce had he crossed the threshold, when the strong hand of Arbacesplunged him forwards.\'The word shall never be spoken!\' said the Egyptian, with a loudexultant laugh, and closed the door upon the priest.Calenus had been precipitated down several steps, but not feeling at themoment the pain of his fall, he sprung up again to the door, and beatingat it fiercely with his clenched fist, he cried aloud in what seemedmore a beast\'s howl than a human voice, so keen was his agony anddespair: \'Oh, release me, release me, and I will ask no gold!\'The words but imperfectly penetrated the massive door, and Arbaces againlaughed.  Then, stamping his foot violently, rejoined, perhaps to givevent to his long-stifled passions:\'All the gold of Dalmatia,\' cried he, \'will not buy thee a crust ofbread. Starve, wretch! thy dying groans will never wake even the echo ofthese vast halls; nor will the air ever reveal, as thou gnawest, in thydesperate famine, thy flesh from thy bones, that so perishes the man whothreatened, and could have undone, Arbaces! Farewell!\'\'Oh, pity--mercy! Inhuman villain; was it for this...\'The rest of the sentence was lost to the ear of Arbaces as he passedbackward along the dim hall.  A toad, plump and bloated, lay unmovingbefore his path; the rays of the lamp fell upon its unshaped hideousnessand red upward eye.  Arbaces turned aside that he might not harm it.\'Thou art loathsome and obscene,\' he muttered, \'but thou canst notinjure me; therefore thou art safe in my path.\'The cries of Calenus, dulled and choked by the barrier that confinedhim, yet faintly reached the ear of the Egyptian.  He paused andlistened intently.\'This is unfortunate,\' thought he; \'for I cannot sail till that voice isdumb for ever.  My stores and treasures lie, not in yon dungeon it istrue, but in the opposite wing.  My slaves, as they move them, must nothear his voice.  But what fear of that?  In three days, if he stillsurvive, his accents, by my father\'s beard, must be weak enough,then!--no, they could not pierce even through his tomb.  By Isis, it iscold!--I long for a deep draught of the spiced Falernian.\'With that the remorseless Egyptian drew his gown closer round him, andresought the upper air.Chapter XIVNYDIA ACCOSTS CALENUS.WHAT words of terror, yet of hope, had Nydia overheard!  The next dayGlaucus was to be condemned; yet there lived one who could save him, andadjudge Arbaces to his doom, and that one breathed within a few steps ofher hiding-place!  She caught his cries and shrieks--hisimprecations--his prayers, though they fell choked and muffled on herear.  He was imprisoned, but she knew the secret of his cell: could shebut escape--could she but seek the praetor he might yet in time be givento light, and preserve the Athenian.  Her emotions almost stifled her;her brain reeled--she felt her sense give way--but by a violent effortshe mastered herself,--and, after listening intently for severalminutes, till she was convinced that Arbaces had left the space tosolitude and herself, she crept on as her ear guided her to the verydoor that had closed upon Calenus.  Here she more distinctly caught hisaccents of terror and despair.  Thrice she attempted to speak, andthrice her voice failed to penetrate the folds of the heavy door.  Atlength finding the lock, she applied her lips to its small aperture, andthe prisoner distinctly heard a soft tone breathe his name.His blood curdled--his hair stood on end.  That awful solitude, whatmysterious and preternatural being could penetrate!  \'Who\'s there?\' hecried, in new alarm; \'what spectre--what dread larva, calls upon thelost Calenus?\'\'Priest,\' replied the Thessalian, \'unknown to Arbaces, I have been, bythe permission of the gods, a witness to his perfidy.  If I myself canescape from these walls, I may save thee.  But let thy voice reach myear through this narrow passage, and answer what I ask.\'\'Ah, blessed spirit,\' said the priest, exultingly, and obeying thesuggestion of Nydia, \'save me, and I will sell the very cups on thealtar to pay thy kindness.\'\'I want not thy gold--I want thy secret.  Did I hear aright? Canst thousave the Athenian Glaucus from the charge against his life?\'\'I can--I can!--therefore (may the Furies blast the foul Egyptian!) hathArbaces snared me thus, and left me to starve and rot!\'\'They accuse the Athenian of murder: canst thou disprove theaccusation?\'\'Only free me, and the proudest head of Pompeii is not more safe thanhis. I saw the deed done--I saw Arbaces strike the blow; I can convictthe true murderer and acquit the innocent man.  But if I perish, he diesalso.  Dost thou interest thyself for him?  Oh, blessed stranger, in myheart is the urn which condemns or frees him!\'\'And thou wilt give full evidence of what thou knowest?\'\'Will!--Oh! were hell at my feet--yes!  Revenge on the falseEgyptian!--revenge!--revenge! revenge!\'As through his ground teeth Calenus shrieked forth those last words,Nydia felt that in his worst passions was her certainty of his justiceto the Athenian.  Her heart beat: was it to be her proud destiny topreserve her idolized--her adored?  Enough,\' said she, \'the powers thatconducted me hither will carry me through all.  Yes, I feel that I shalldeliver thee. Wait in patience and hope.\'\'But be cautious, be prudent, sweet stranger.  Attempt not to appeal toArbaces--he is marble.  Seek the praetor--say what thou knowest--obtainhis writ of search; bring soldiers, and smiths of cunning--these locksare wondrous strong!  Time flies--I may starve--starve! if you are notquick! Go--go!  Yet stay--it is horrible to be alone!--the air is like acharnel--and the scorpions--ha! and the pale larvae; oh! stay, stay!\'\'Nay,\' said Nydia, terrified by the terror of the priest, and anxious toconfer with herself--\'nay, for thy sake, I must depart. Take hope forthy companion--farewell!\'So saying, she glided away, and felt with extended arms along thepillared space until she had gained the farther end of the hall and themouth of the passage that led to the upper air.  But there she paused;she felt that it would be more safe to wait awhile, until the night wasso far blended with the morning that the whole house would be buried insleep, and so that she might quit it unobserved.  She, therefore, oncemore laid herself down, and counted the weary moments.  In her sanguineheart, joy was the predominant emotion.  Glaucus was in deadlyperil--but she should save him!Chapter XVARBACES AND IONE.  NYDIA GAINS THE GARDEN.  WILL SHE ESCAPE AND SAVE THEATHENIAN?WHEN Arbaces had warmed his veins by large draughts of that spiced andperfumed wine so valued by the luxurious, he felt more than usuallyelated and exultant of heart.  There is a pride in triumphant ingenuity,not less felt, perhaps, though its object be guilty.  Our vain humannature hugs itself in the consciousness of superior craft andself-obtained success--afterwards comes the horrible reaction ofremorse.But remorse was not a feeling which Arbaces was likely ever toexperience for the fate of the base Calenus.  He swept from hisremembrance the thought of the priest\'s agonies and lingering death: hefelt only that a great danger was passed, and a possible foe silenced;all left to him now would be to account to the priesthood for thedisappearance of Calenus; and this he imagined it would not be difficultto do.  Calenus had often been employed by him in various religiousmissions to the neighboring cities.  On some such errand he could nowassert that he had been sent, with offerings to the shrines of Isis atHerculaneum and Neapolis, placatory of the goddess for the recent murderof her priest Apaecides.  When Calenus had expired, his body might bethrown, previous to the Egyptian\'s departure from Pompeii, into the deepstream of the Sarnus; and when discovered, suspicion would probably fallupon the Nazarene atheists, as an act of revenge for the death ofOlinthus at the arena. After rapidly running over these plans forscreening himself, Arbaces dismissed at once from his mind allrecollection of the wretched priest; and, animated by the success whichhad lately crowned all his schemes, he surrendered his thoughts to Ione.The last time he had seen her, she had driven him from her presence by areproachful and bitter scorn, which his arrogant nature was unable toendure.  He now felt emboldened once more to renew that interview; forhis passion for her was like similar feelings in other men--it made himrestless for her presence, even though in that presence he wasexasperated and humbled.  From delicacy to her grief he laid not asidehis dark and unfestive robes, but, renewing the perfumes on his ravenlocks, and arranging his tunic in its most becoming folds, he sought thechamber of the Neapolitan.  Accosting the slave in attendance without,he inquired if Ione had yet retired to rest; and learning that she wasstill up, and unusually quiet and composed, he ventured into herpresence.  He found his beautiful ward sitting before a small table, andleaning her face upon both her hands in the attitude of thought.  Yetthe expression of the face itself possessed not its wonted bright andPsyche-like expression of sweet intelligence; the lips were apart--theeye vacant and unheeding--and the long dark hair, falling neglected anddisheveled upon her neck, gave by the contrast additional paleness to acheek which had already lost the roundness of its contour.Arbaces gazed upon her a moment ere he advanced.  She, too, lifted upher eyes; and when she saw who was the intruder, shut them with anexpression of pain, but did not stir.\'Ah!\' said Arbaces in a low and earnest tone as he respectfully, nay,humbly, advanced and seated himself at a little distance from thetable--\'Ah! that my death could remove thy hatred, then would I gladlydie! Thou wrongest me, Ione; but I will bear the wrong without a murmur,only let me see thee sometimes.  Chide, reproach, scorn me, if thouwilt--I will teach myself to bear it.  And is not even thy bitteresttone sweeter to me than the music of the most artful lute? In thysilence the world seems to stand still--a stagnation curdles up theveins of the earth--there is no earth, no life, without the light of thycountenance and the melody of thy voice.\'\'Give me back my brother and my betrothed,\' said Ione, in a calm andimploring tone, and a few large tears rolled unheeded down her cheeks.\'Would that I could restore the one and save the other!\' returnedArbaces, with apparent emotion.  \'Yes; to make thee happy I wouldrenounce my ill-fated love, and gladly join thy hand to the Athenian\'s.Perhaps he will yet come unscathed from his trial (Arbaces had preventedher learning that the trial had already commenced); if so, thou art freeto judge or condemn him thyself.  And think not, O Ione, that I wouldfollow thee longer with a prayer of love.  I know it is in vain.  Sufferme only to weep--to mourn with thee.  Forgive a violence deeplyrepented, and that shall offend no more.  Let me be to thee only what Ionce was--a friend, a father, a Protector.  Ah, Ione! spare me andforgive.\'\'I forgive thee.  Save but Glaucus, and I will renounce him.  O mightyArbaces! thou art powerful in evil or in good: save the Athenian, andthe poor Ione will never see him more.\' As she spoke, she rose with weakand trembling limbs, and falling at his feet, she clasped his knees:\'Oh! if thou really lovest me--if thou art human--remember my father\'sashes, remember my childhood, think of all the hours we passed happilytogether, and save my Glaucus!\'Strange convulsions shook the frame of the Egyptian; his features workedfearfully--he turned his face aside, and said, in a hollow voice, \'If Icould save him, even now, I would; but the Roman law is stern and sharp.Yet if I could succeed--if I could rescue and set him free--wouldst thoube mine--my bride?\'\'Thine?\' repeated Ione, rising: \'thine!--thy bride?  My brother\'s bloodis unavenged: who slew him?  O Nemesis, can I even sell, for the life ofGlaucus, thy solemn trust?  Arbaces--thine?  Never.\'\'Ione, Ione!\' cried Arbaces, passionately; \'why these mysteriouswords?--why dost thou couple my name with the thought of thy brother\'sdeath?\'\'My dreams couple it--and dreams are from the gods.\'\'Vain fantasies all!  Is it for a dream that thou wouldst wrong theinnocent, and hazard thy sole chance of saving thy lover\'s life?\'\'Hear me!\' said Ione, speaking firmly, and with a deliberate and solemnvoice: \'If Glaucus be saved by thee, I will never be borne to his home abride.  But I cannot master the horror of other rites: I cannot wed withthee.  Interrupt me not; but mark me, Arbaces!--if Glaucus die, on thatsame day I baffle thine arts, and leave to thy love only my dust!Yes--thou mayst put the knife and the poison from my reach--thou maystimprison--thou mayst chain me, but the brave soul resolved to escape isnever without means.  These hands, naked and unarmed though they be,shall tear away the bonds of life.  Fetter them, and these lips shallfirmly refuse the air. Thou art learned--thou hast read how women havedied rather than meet dishonour.  If Glaucus perish, I will notunworthily linger behind him.  By all the gods of the heaven, and theocean, and the earth, I devote myself to death!  I have said!\'High, proud, dilating in her stature, like one inspired, the air andvoice of Ione struck an awe into the breast of her listener.\'Brave heart!\' said he, after a short pause; \'thou art indeed worthy tobe mine.  Oh! that I should have dreamt of such a partner in my loftydestinies, and never found it but in thee! Ione,\' he continued rapidly,\'dost thou not see that we are born for each other? Canst thou notrecognize something kindred to thine own energy--thine own courage--inthis high and self-dependent soul?  We were formed to unite oursympathies--formed to breathe a new spirit into this hackneyed and grossworld--formed for the mighty ends which my soul, sweeping down the gloomof time, foresees with a prophet\'s vision.  With a resolution equal tothine own, I defy thy threats of an inglorious suicide.  I hail thee asmy own!  Queen of climes undarkened by the eagle\'s wing, unravaged byhis beak, I bow before thee in homage and in awe--but I claim thee inworship and in love! Together will we cross the ocean--together will wefound our realm; and far distant ages shall acknowledge the long race ofkings born from the marriage-bed of Arbaces and Ione!\'\'Thou ravest!  These mystic declamations are suited rather to somepalsied crone selling charms in the market-place than to the wiseArbaces.  Thou hast heard my resolution--it is fixed as the Fatesthemselves.  Orcus has heard my vow, and it is written in the book ofthe unforgetful Hades. Atone, then, O Arbaces!--atone the past: converthatred into regard--vengeance into gratitude; preserve one who shallnever be thy rival. These are acts suited to thy original nature, whichgives forth sparks of something high and noble.  They weigh in thescales of the Kings of Death: they turn the balance on that day when thedisembodied soul stands shivering and dismayed between Tartarus andElysium; they gladden the heart in life, better and longer than thereward of a momentary passion.  Oh, Arbaces! hear me, and be swayed!\'\'Enough, Ione.  All that I can do for Glaucus shall be done; but blameme not if I fail.  Inquire of my foes, even, if I have not sought, if Ido not seek, to turn aside the sentence from his head; and judge meaccordingly. Sleep then, Ione.  Night wanes; I leave thee to rest--andmayst thou have kinder dreams of one who has no existence but in thine.\'Without waiting a reply, Arbaces hastily withdrew; afraid, perhaps, totrust himself further to the passionate prayer of Ione, which racked himwith jealousy, even while it touched him to compassion.  But compassionitself came too late.  Had Ione even pledged him her hand as his reward,he could not now--his evidence given--the populace excited--have savedthe Athenian. Still made sanguine by his very energy of mind, he threwhimself on the chances of the future, and believed he should yet triumphover the woman that had so entangled his passions.As his attendants assisted to unrobe him for the night, the thought ofNydia flashed across him.  He felt it was necessary that Ione shouldnever learn of her lover\'s frenzy, lest it might excuse his imputedcrime; and it was possible that her attendants might inform her thatNydia was under his roof, and she might desire to see her.  As this ideacrossed him, he turned to one of his freedmen:\'Go, Callias,\' said he, \'forthwith to Sosia, and tell him, that on nopretence is he to suffer the blind slave Nydia out of her chamber.  But,stay--first seek those in attendance upon my ward, and caution them notto inform her that the blind girl is under my roof Go--quick!\'The freedman hastened to obey.  After having discharged his commissionwith respect to Ione\'s attendants, he sought the worthy Sosia.  He foundhim not in the little cell which was apportioned for his cubiculum; hecalled his name aloud, and from Nydia\'s chamber, close at hand, he heardthe voice of Sosia reply:\'Oh, Callias, is it you that I hear?--the gods be praised!\' Open thedoor, I pray you!\'Callias withdrew the bolt, and the rueful face of Sosia hastilyprotruded itself.\'What!--in the chamber with that young girl, Sosia! Proh pudor! Arethere not fruits ripe enough on the wall, but that thou must tamper withsuch green...\'\'Name not the little witch!\' interrupted Sosia, impatiently; \'she willbe my ruin!\' And he forthwith imparted to Callias the history of the AirDemon, and the escape of the Thessalian.\'Hang thyself, then, unhappy Sosia!  I am just charged from Arbaces witha message to thee; on no account art thou to suffer her, even for amoment, from that chamber!\'\'Me miserum!\' exclaimed the slave.  \'What can I do!--by this time shemay have visited half Pompeii.  But tomorrow I will undertake to catchher in her old haunts.  Keep but my counsel, my dear Callias.\'\'I will do all that friendship can, consistent with my own safety. Butare you sure she has left the house?--she may be hiding here yet.\'\'How is that possible?  She could easily have gained the garden; and thedoor, as I told thee, was open.\'\'Nay, not so; for, at that very hour thou specifiest, Arbaces was in thegarden with the priest Calenus.  I went there in search of some herbsfor my master\'s bath to-morrow.  I saw the table set out; but the gate Iam sure was shut: depend upon it, that Calenus entered by the garden,and naturally closed the door after him.\'\'But it was not locked.\'\'Yes; for I myself, angry at a negligence which might expose the bronzesin the peristyle to the mercy of any robber, turned the key, took itaway, and--as I did not see the proper slave to whom to give it, or Ishould have rated him finely--here it actually is, still in my girdle.\'\'Oh, merciful Bacchus!  I did not pray to thee in vain, after all.  Letus not lose a moment!  Let us to the garden instantly--she may yet bethere!\'The good-natured Callias consented to assist the slave; and after vainlysearching the chambers at hand, and the recesses of the peristyle, theyentered the garden.It was about this time that Nydia had resolved to quit her hiding-place,and venture forth on her way.  Lightly, tremulously holding her breath,which ever and anon broke forth in quick convulsive gasps--now glidingby the flower--wreathed columns that bordered the peristyle--nowdarkening the still moonshine that fell over its tessellated centre--nowascending the terrace of the garden--now gliding amidst the gloomy andbreathless trees, she gained the fatal door--to find it locked!  We haveall seen that expression of pain, of uncertainty, of fear, which asudden disappointment of touch, if I may use the expression, casts overthe face of the blind. But what words can paint the intolerable woe, thesinking of the whole heart, which was now visible on the features of theThessalian? Again and again her small, quivering hands wandered to andfro the inexorable door. Poor thing that thou wert! in vain had been allthy noble courage, thy innocent craft, thy doublings to escape the houndand huntsmen!  Within but a few yards from thee, laughing at thyendeavors--thy despair--knowing thou wert now their own, and watchingwith cruel patience their own moment to seize their prey--thou art savedfrom seeing thy pursuers!\'Hush, Callias!--let her go on.  Let us see what she will do when shehas convinced herself that the door is honest.\'\'Look! she raises her face to the heavens--she mutters--she sinks downdespondent!  No!  by Pollux, she has some new scheme!  She will notresign herself!  By Jupiter, a tough spirit!  See, she springs up--sheretraces her steps--she thinks of some other chance!--I advise thee,Sosia, to delay no longer: seize her ere she quit the garden--now!\'\'Ah! runaway!  I have thee--eh?\' said Sosia, seizing upon the unhappyNydia. As a hare\'s last human cry in the fangs of the dogs--as the sharpvoice of terror uttered by a sleep-walker suddenly awakened--broke theshriek of the blind girl, when she felt the abrupt gripe of her gaoler.It was a shriek of such utter agony, such entire despair, that it mighthave rung hauntingly in your ears for ever.  She felt as if the lastplank of the sinking Glaucus were torn from his clasp!  It had been asuspense of life and death; and death had now won the game.\'Gods! that cry will alarm the house!  Arbaces sleeps full lightly. Gagher!\' cried Callias.\'Ah! here is the very napkin with which the young witch conjured away myreason!  Come, that\'s right; now thou art dumb as well as blind.\'And, catching the light weight in his arms, Sosia soon gained the house,and reached the chamber from which Nydia had escaped. There, removingthe gag, he left her to a solitude so racked and terrible, that out ofHades its anguish could scarcely be exceeded.Chapter XVITHE SORROW OF BOON COMPANIONS FOR OUR AFFLICTIONS.  THE DUNGEON AND ITSVICTIMS.IT was now late on the third and last day of the trial of Glaucus andOlinthus.  A few hours after the court had broken up and judgment beengiven, a small party of the fashionable youth at Pompeii were assembledround the fastidious board of Lepidus.\'So Glaucus denies his crime to the last?\' said Clodius.\'Yes; but the testimony of Arbaces was convincing; he saw the blowgiven,\' answered Lepidus.\'What could have been the cause?\'\'Why, the priest was a gloomy and sullen fellow.  He probably ratedGlaucus soundly about his gay life and gaming habits, and ultimatelyswore he would not consent to his marriage with Ione.  High words arose;Glaucus seems to have been full of the passionate god, and struck insudden exasperation. The excitement of wine, the desperation of abruptremorse, brought on the delirium under which he suffered for some days;and I can readily imagine, poor fellow! that, yet confused by thatdelirium, he is even now unconscious of the crime he committed!  Such,at least, is the shrewd conjecture of Arbaces, who seems to have beenmost kind and forbearing in his testimony.\'\'Yes; he has made himself generally popular by it.  But, inconsideration of these extenuating circumstances, the senate should haverelaxed the sentence.\'\'And they would have done so, but for the people; but they wereoutrageous. The priest had spared no pains to excite them; and theyimagined--the ferocious brutes!--because Glaucus was a rich man and agentleman, that he was likely to escape; and therefore they wereinveterate against him, and doubly resolved upon his sentence.  Itseems, by some accident or other, that he was never formally enrolled asa Roman citizen; and thus the senate is deprived of the power to resistthe people, though, after all, there was but a majority of three againsthim.  Ho! the Chian!\'\'He looks sadly altered; but how composed and fearless!\'\'Ay, we shall see if his firmness will last over to-morrow. But whatmerit in courage, when that atheistical hound, Olinthus, manifested thesame?\'\'The blasphemer!  Yes,\' said Lepidus, with pious wrath, \'no wonder thatone of the decurions was, but two days ago, struck dead by lightning ina serene sky.\' The gods feel vengeance against Pompeii while the viledesecrator is alive within its walls.\'\'Yet so lenient was the senate, that had he but expressed his penitence,and scattered a few grains of incense on the altar of Cybele, he wouldhave been let off.  I doubt whether these Nazarenes, had they the statereligion, would be as tolerant to us, supposing we had kicked down theimage of their Deity, blasphemed their rites, and denied their faith.\'\'They give Glaucus one chance, in consideration of the circumstances;they allow him, against the lion, the use of the same stilus wherewithhe smote the priest.\'\'Hast thou seen the lion? hast thou looked at his teeth and fangs, andwilt thou call that a chance?  Why, sword and buckler would be mere reedand papyrus against the rush of the mighty beast!  No, I think the truemercy has been, not to leave him long in suspense; and it was thereforefortunate for him that our benign laws are slow to pronounce, but swiftto execute; and that the games of the amphitheatre had been, by a sortof providence, so long since fixed for to-morrow.  He who awaits death,dies twice.\'\'As for the Atheist,\' said Clodius, \'he is to cope the grim tigernaked-handed.  Well, these combats are past betting on.  Who will takethe odds?\' A peal of laughter announced the ridicule of the question.\'Poor Clodius!\' said the host; \'I to lose a friend is something; but tofind no one to bet on the chance of his escape is a worse misfortune tothee.\'\'Why, it is provoking; it would have been some consolation to him and tome to think he was useful to the last.\'\'The people,\' said the grave Pansa, \'are all delighted with the result.They were so much afraid the sports at the amphitheatre would go offwithout a criminal for the beasts; and now, to get two such criminals isindeed a joy for the poor fellows!  They work hard; they ought to havesome amusement.\'\'There speaks the popular Pansa, who never moves without a string ofclients as long as an Indian triumph.  He is always prating about thepeople.  Gods! he will end by being a Gracchus!\'\'Certainly I am no insolent patrician,\' said Pansa, with a generous air.\'Well,\' observed Lepidus, \'it would have been assuredly dangerous to havebeen merciful at the eve of a beast-fight.  If ever I, though a Romanbred and born, come to be tried, pray Jupiter there may be either nobeasts in the vivaria, or plenty of criminals in the gaol.\'\'And pray,\' said one of the party, \'what has become of the poor girlwhom Glaucus was to have married?  A widow without being a bride--thatis hard!\'\'Oh,\' returned Clodius, \'she is safe under the protection of herguardian, Arbaces.  It was natural she should go to him when she hadlost both lover and brother.\'\'By sweet Venus, Glaucus was fortunate among the women.  They say therich Julia was in love with him.\'\'A mere fable, my friend,\' said Clodius, coxcombically; \'I was with herto-day.  If any feeling of the sort she ever conceived, I flatter myselfthat I have consoled her.\'\'Hush, gentlemen!\' said Pansa; \'do you not know that Clodius is employedat the house of Diomed in blowing hard at the torch?  It begins to burn,and will soon shine bright on the shrine of Hymen.\'\'Is it so?\' said Lepidus.  \'What! Clodius become a married man?--Fie!\'\'Never fear,\' answered Clodius; \'old Diomed is delighted at the notionof marrying his daughter to a nobleman, and will come down largely withthe sesterces.  You will see that I shall not lock them up in theatrium.  It will be a white day for his jolly friends, when Clodiusmarries an heiress.\'\'Say you so?\' cried Lepidus; \'come, then, a full cup to the health ofthe fair Julia!\'While such was the conversation--one not discordant to the tone of mindcommon among the dissipated of that day, and which might perhaps, acentury ago, have found an echo in the looser circles of Paris--whilesuch, I say, was the conversation in the gaudy triclinium of Lepidus,far different the scene which scowled before the young Athenian.After his condemnation, Glaucus was admitted no more to the gentleguardianship of Sallust, the only friend of his distress.  He was ledalong the forum till the guards stopped at a small door by the side ofthe temple of Jupiter.  You may see the place still.  The door opened inthe centre in a somewhat singular fashion, revolving round on itshinges, as it were, like a modern turnstile, so as only to leave halfthe threshold open at the same time.  Through this narrow aperture theythrust the prisoner, placed before him a loaf and a pitcher of water,and left him to darkness, and, as he thought, to solitude.  So suddenhad been that revolution of fortune which had prostrated him from thepalmy height of youthful pleasure and successful love to the lowestabyss of ignominy, and the horror of a most bloody death, that he couldscarcely convince himself that he was not held in the meshes of somefearful dream.  His elastic and glorious frame had triumphed over apotion, the greater part of which he had fortunately not drained.  Hehad recovered sense and consciousness, but still a dim and mistydepression clung to his nerves and darkened his mind.  His naturalcourage, and the Greek nobility of pride, enabled him to vanquish allunbecoming apprehension, and, in the judgment-court, to face his awfullot with a steady mien and unquailing eye.  But the consciousness ofinnocence scarcely sufficed to support him when the gaze of men nolonger excited his haughty valor, and he was left to loneliness andsilence.  He felt the damps of the dungeon sink chillingly into hisenfeebled frame.  He--the fastidious, the luxurious, the refined--he whohad hitherto braved no hardship and known no sorrow.  Beautiful birdthat he was! why had he left his far and sunny clime--the olive-grovesof his native hills--the music of immemorial streams?  Why had hewantoned on his glittering plumage amidst these harsh and ungenialstrangers, dazzling the eyes with his gorgeous hues, charming the earwith his blithesome song--thus suddenly to be arrested--caged indarkness--a victim and a prey--his gay flights for ever over--his hymnsof gladness for ever stilled!  The poor Athenian! his very faults theexuberance of a gentle and joyous nature, how little had his past careerfitted him for the trials he was destined to undergo!  The hoots of themob, amidst whose plaudits he had so often guided his graceful car andbounding steeds, still rang gratingly in his ear.  The cold and stonyfaces of former friends (the co-mates of merry revels) still rose beforehis eye.  None now were by to soothe, to sustain, the admired, theadulated stranger.  These walls opened but on the dread arena of aviolent and shameful death.  And Ione! of her, too, he had heard naught;no encouraging word, no pitying message; she, too, had forsaken him; shebelieved him guilty--and of what crime?--the murder of a brother!  Heground his teeth--he groaned aloud--and ever and anon a sharp fear shotacross him.  In that fell and fierce delirium which had so unaccountablyseized his soul, which had so ravaged the disordered brain, might henot, indeed, unknowing to himself, have committed the crime of which hewas accused?  Yet, as the thought flashed upon him, it was as suddenlychecked; for, amidst all the darkness of the past, he thought distinctlyto recall the dim grove of Cybele, the upward face of the pale dead, thepause that he had made beside the corpse, and the sudden shock thatfelled him to the earth.  He felt convinced of his innocence; and yetwho, to the latest time, long after his mangled remains were mingledwith the elements, would believe him guiltless, or uphold his fame?  Ashe recalled his interview with Arbaces, and the causes of revenge whichhad been excited in the heart of that dark and fearful man, he could notbut believe that he was the victim of some deep-laid and mysterioussnare--the clue and train of which he was lost in attempting todiscover: and Ione--Arbaces loved her--might his rival\'s success befounded upon his ruin?  That thought cut him more deeply than all; andhis noble heart was more stung by jealousy than appalled by fear.  Againhe groaned aloud.A voice from the recess of the darkness answered that burst of anguish.\'Who (it said) is my companion in this awful hour?  Athenian Glaucus, itis thou?\'\'So, indeed, they called me in mine hour of fortune: they may have othernames for me now.  And thy name, stranger?\'\'Is Olinthus, thy co-mate in the prison as the trial.\'\'What! he whom they call the Atheist?  Is it the injustice of men thathath taught thee to deny the providence of the gods?\'\'Alas!\' answered Olinthus: \'thou, not I, art the true Atheist, for thoudeniest the sole true God--the Unknown One--to whom thy Athenian fatherserected an altar.  It is in this hour that I know my God.  He is with mein the dungeon; His smile penetrates the darkness; on the eve of deathmy heart whispers immortality, and earth recedes from me but to bringthe weary soul nearer unto heaven.\'\'Tell me,\' said Glaucus, abruptly, \'did I not hear thy name coupled withthat of Apaecides in my trial?  Dost thou believe me guilty?\'\'God alone reads the heart! but my suspicion rested not upon thee.\'\'On whom then?\'\'Thy accuser, Arbaces.\'\'Ha! thou cheerest me: and wherefore?\'\'Because I know the man\'s evil breast, and he had cause to fear him whois now dead.\'With that, Olinthus proceeded to inform Glaucus of those details whichthe reader already knows, the conversion of Apaecides, the plan they hadproposed for the detection of the impostures of the Egyptian upon theyouthful weakness of the proselyte.  \'Therefore,\' concluded Olinthus,\'had the deceased encountered Arbaces, reviled his treasons, andthreatened detection, the place, the hour, might have favored the wrathof the Egyptian, and passion and craft alike dictated the fatal blow.\'\'It must have been so!\' cried Glaucus, joyfully.  \'I am happy.\'\'Yet what, O unfortunate! avails to thee now the discovery?  Thou artcondemned and fated; and in thine innocence thou wilt perish.\'\'But I shall know myself guiltless; and in my mysterious madness I hadfearful, though momentary, doubts.  Yet tell me, man of a strange creed,thinkest thou that for small errors, or for ancestral faults, we are forever abandoned and accursed by the powers above, whatever name thouallottest to them?\'\'God is just, and abandons not His creatures for their mere humanfrailty. God is merciful, and curses none but the wicked who repentnot.\'\'Yet it seemeth to me as if, in the divine anger, I had been smitten bya sudden madness, a supernatural and solemn frenzy, wrought not by humanmeans.\'\'There are demons on earth,\' answered the Nazarene, fearfully, \'as wellas there are God and His Son in heaven; and since thou acknowledgest notthe last, the first may have had power over thee.\'Glaucus did not reply, and there was a silence for some minutes. Atlength the Athenian said, in a changed, and soft, and half-hesitatingvoice. \'Christian, believest thou, among the doctrines of thy creed,that the dead live again--that they who have loved here are unitedhereafter--that beyond the grave our good name shines pure from themortal mists that unjustly dim it in the gross-eyed world--and that thestreams which are divided by the desert and the rock meet in the solemnHades, and flow once more into one?\'\'Believe I that, O Athenian No, I do not believe--I know! and it is thatbeautiful and blessed assurance which supports me now.  O Cyllene!\'continued Olinthus, passionately, \'bride of my heart! torn from me inthe first month of our nuptials,\' shall I not see thee yet, and ere manydays be past?  Welcome, welcome death, that will bring me to heaven andthee!\'There was something in this sudden burst of human affection which strucka kindred chord in the soul of the Greek.  He felt, for the first time,a sympathy greater than mere affliction between him and his companion.He crept nearer towards Olinthus; for the Italians, fierce in somepoints, were not unnecessarily cruel in others; they spared the separatecell and the superfluous chain, and allowed the victims of the arena thesad comfort of such freedom and such companionship as the prison wouldafford.\'Yes,\' continued the Christian, with holy fervor, \'the immortality ofthe soul--the resurrection--the reunion of the dead--is the greatprinciple of our creed--the great truth a God suffered death itself toattest and proclaim.  No fabled Elysium--no poetic Orcus--but a pure andradiant heritage of heaven itself, is the portion of the good.\'\'Tell me, then, thy doctrines, and expound to me thy hopes,\' saidGlaucus, earnestly.Olinthus was not slow to obey that prayer; and there--as oftentimes inthe early ages of the Christian creed--it was in the darkness of thedungeon, and over the approach of death, that the dawning Gospel shedits soft and consecrating rays.Chapter XVIIA CHANCE FOR GLAUCUS.THE hours passed in lingering torture over the head of Nydia from thetime in which she had been replaced in her cell.Sosia, as if afraid he should be again outwitted, had refrained fromvisiting her until late in the morning of the following day, and then hebut thrust in the periodical basket of food and wine, and hastilyreclosed the door.  That day rolled on, and Nydia felt herselfpent--barred--inexorably confined, when that day was the judgment-day ofGlaucus, and when her release would have saved him! Yet knowing, almostimpossible as seemed her escape, that the sole chance for the life ofGlaucus rested on her, this young girl, frail, passionate, and acutelysusceptible as she was--resolved not to give way to a despair that woulddisable her from seizing whatever opportunity might occur.  She kept hersenses whenever, beneath the whirl of intolerable thought, they reeledand tottered; nay, she took food and wine that she might sustain herstrength--that she might be prepared!She revolved scheme after scheme of escape, and was forced to dismissall. Yet Sosia was her only hope, the only instrument with which shecould tamper.  He had been superstitious in the desire of ascertainingwhether he could eventually purchase his freedom.  Blessed gods! mighthe not be won by the bribe of freedom itself? was she not nearly richenough to purchase it? Her slender arms were covered with bracelets, thepresents of Ione; and on her neck she yet wore that very chain which, itmay be remembered, had occasioned her jealous quarrel with Glaucus, andwhich she had afterwards promised vainly to wear for ever.  She waitedburningly till Sosia should again appear: but as hour after hour passed,and he came not, she grew impatient.  Every nerve beat with fever; shecould endure the solitude no longer--she groaned, she shriekedaloud--she beat herself against the door. Her cries echoed along thehall, and Sosia, in peevish anger, hastened to see what was the matter,and silence his prisoner if possible.\'Ho! ho! what is this?\' said he, surlily.  \'Young slave, if thouscreamest out thus, we must gag thee again.  My shoulders will smart forit, if thou art heard by my master.\'\'Kind Sosia, chide me not--I cannot endure to be so long alone,\'answered Nydia; \'the solitude appals me.  Sit with me, I pray, a littlewhile.  Nay, fear not that I should attempt to escape; place thy seatbefore the door. Keep thine eye on me--I will not stir from this spot.\'Sosia, who was a considerable gossip himself, was moved by this address.He pitied one who had nobody to talk with--it was his case too; hepitied--and resolved to relieve himself.  He took the hint of Nydia,placed a stool before the door, leant his back against it, and replied:\'I am sure I do not wish to be churlish; and so far as a little innocentchat goes, I have no objection to indulge you.  But mind, no tricks--nomore conjuring!\'\'No, no; tell me, dear Sosia, what is the hour?\'\'It is already evening--the goats are going home.\'\'O gods! how went the trial\'\'Both condemned.\'Nydia repressed the shriek.  \'Well--well, I thought it would be so. Whendo they suffer?\'\'To-morrow, in the amphitheatre.  If it were not for thee, littlewretch, I should be allowed to go with the rest and see it.\'Nydia leant back for some moments.  Nature could endure no more--she hadfainted away.  But Sosia did not perceive it, for it was the dusk ofeve, and he was full of his own privations.  He went on lamenting theloss of so delightful a show, and accusing the injustice of Arbaces forsingling him out from all his fellows to be converted into a gaoler; andere he had half finished, Nydia, with a deep sigh, recovered the senseof life.\'Thou sighest, blind one, at my loss!  Well, that is some comfort.  Solong as you acknowledge how much you cost me, I will endeavor not togrumble.  It is hard to be ill-treated, and yet not pitied.\'\'Sosia, how much dost thou require to make up the purchase of thyfreedom?\'\'How much?  Why, about two thousand sesterces.\'\'The gods be praised! not more?  Seest thou these bracelets and thischain? They are well worth double that sum.  I will give them theeif...\'\'Tempt me not: I cannot release thee.  Arbaces is a severe and awfulmaster. Who knows but I might feed the fishes of the Sarnus Alas! allthe sesterces in the world would not buy me back into life.  Better alive dog than a dead lion.\'\'Sosia, thy freedom!  Think well!  If thou wilt let me out only for onelittle hour!--let me out at midnight--I will return ere to-morrow\'sdawn; nay, thou canst go with me.\'\'No,\' said Sosia, sturdily, \'a slave once disobeyed Arbaces, and he wasnever more heard of.\'\'But the law gives a master no power over the life of a slave.\'\'The law is very obliging, but more polite than efficient.  I know thatArbaces always gets the law on his side.  Besides, if I am once dead,what law can bring me to life again!\'Nydia wrung her hands.  \'Is there no hope, then?\' said she,convulsively.\'None of escape till Arbaces gives the word.\'\'Well, then, said Nydia, quickly, \'thou wilt not, at least, refuse totake a letter for me: thy master cannot kill thee for that.\'\'To whom?\'\'The praetor.\'\'To a magistrate?  No--not I.  I should be made a witness in court, forwhat I know; and the way they cross-examine the slaves is by thetorture.\'\'Pardon: I meant not the praetor--it was a word that escaped meunawares: I meant quite another person--the gay Sallust.\'\'Oh! and what want you with him?\'\'Glaucus was my master; he purchased me from a cruel lord.  He alone hasbeen kind to me.  He is to die.  I shall never live happily if I cannot,in his hour of trial and doom, let him know that one heart is gratefulto him. Sallust is his friend; he will convey my message.\'\'I am sure he will do no such thing.  Glaucus will have enough to thinkof between this and to-morrow without troubling his head about a blindgirl.\'\'Man,\' said Nydia, rising, \'wilt thou become free?  Thou hast the offerin thy power; to-morrow it will be too late.  Never was freedom morecheaply purchased.  Thou canst easily and unmissed leave home: less thanhalf an hour will suffice for thine absence.  And for such a trifle wiltthou refuse liberty?\'Sosia was greatly moved.  It was true that the request was remarkablysilly; but what was that to him?  So much the better.  He could lock thedoor on Nydia, and, if Arbaces should learn his absence, the offence wasvenial, and would merit but a reprimand.  Yet, should Nydia\'s lettercontain something more than what she had said--should it speak of herimprisonment, as he shrewdly conjectured it would do--what then!  Itneed never be known to Arbaces that he had carried the letter.  At theworst the bribe was enormous--the risk light--the temptationirresistible.  He hesitated no longer--he assented to the proposal.\'Give me the trinkets, and I will take the letter.  Yet stay--thou art aslave--thou hast no right to these ornaments--they are thy master\'s.\'\'They were the gifts of Glaucus; he is my master.  What chance hath heto claim them?  Who else will know they are in my possession?\'\'Enough--I will bring thee the papyrus.\'\'No, not papyrus--a tablet of wax and a stilus.\'Nydia, as the reader will have seen, was born of gentle parents. Theyhad done all to lighten her calamity, and her quick intellect secondedtheir exertions.  Despite her blindness, she had therefore acquired inchildhood, though imperfectly, the art to write with the sharp stilusupon waxen tablets, in which her exquisite sense of touch came to heraid.  When the tablets were brought to her, she thus painfully tracedsome words in Greek, the language of her childhood, and which almostevery Italian of the higher ranks was then supposed to know.  Shecarefully wound round the epistle the thread, and covered its knot withwax; and ere she placed it in the hands of Sosia, she thus addressedhim:\'Sosia, I am blind and in prison.  Thou mayst think to deceive me--thoumayst pretend only to take the letter to Sallust--thou mayst not fulfillthy charge: but here I solemnly dedicate thy head to vengeance, thy soulto the infernal powers, if thou wrongest thy trust; and I call upon theeto place thy right hand of faith in mine, and repeat after me thesewords: ""By the ground on which we stand--by the elements which containlife and can curse life--by Orcus, the all-avenging--by the OlympianJupiter, the all-seeing--I swear that I will honestly discharge mytrust, and faithfully deliver into the hands of Sallust this letter!And if I perjure myself in this oath, may the full curses of heaven andhell be wreaked upon me!"" Enough!--I trust thee--take thy reward.  It isalready dark--depart at once.\'\'Thou art a strange girl, and thou hast frightened me terribly; but itis all very natural: and if Sallust is to be found, I give him thisletter as I have sworn.  By my faith, I may have my little peccadilloes!but perjury--no!  I leave that to my betters.\'With this Sosia withdrew, carefully passing the heavy bolt athwartNydia\'s door--carefully locking its wards: and, hanging the key to hisgirdle, he retired to his own den, enveloped himself from head to footin a huge disguising cloak, and slipped out by the back way undisturbedand unseen.The streets were thin and empty.  He soon gained the house of Sallust.The porter bade him leave his letter, and be gone; for Sallust was sogrieved at the condemnation of Glaucus, that he could not on any accountbe disturbed.\'Nevertheless, I have sworn to give this letter into his own hands--doso I must!\' And Sosia, well knowing by experience that Cerberus loves asop, thrust some half a dozen sesterces into the hand of the porter.\'Well, well,\' said the latter, relenting, \'you may enter if you will;but, to tell you the truth, Sallust is drinking himself out of hisgrief.  It is his way when anything disturbs him.  He orders a capitalsupper, the best wine, and does not give over till everything is out ofhis head--but the liquor.\'\'An excellent plan--excellent!  Ah, what it is to be rich!  If I wereSallust, I would have some grief or another every day.  But just say akind word for me with the atriensis--I see him coming.\'Sallust was too sad to receive company; he was too sad, also, to drinkalone; so, as was his wont, he admitted his favorite freedman to hisentertainment, and a stranger banquet never was held.  For ever andanon, the kind-hearted epicure sighed, whimpered, wept outright, andthen turned with double zest to some new dish or his refilled goblet.\'My good fellow,\' said he to his companion, it was a most awfuljudgment--heigho!--it is not bad that kid, eh?  Poor, dearGlaucus!--what a jaw the lion has too!  Ah, ah, ah!\'And Sallust sobbed loudly--the fit was stopped by a counteraction ofhiccups.\'Take a cup of wine,\' said the freedman.\'A thought too cold: but then how cold Glaucus must be!  Shut up thehouse to-morrow--not a slave shall stir forth--none of my people shallhonour that cursed arena--No, no!\'\'Taste the Falernian--your grief distracts you.  By the gods it does--apiece of that cheesecake.\'It was at this auspicious moment that Sosia was admitted to the presenceof the disconsolate carouser.\'Ho--what art thou?\'\'Merely a messenger to Sallust.  I give him this billet from a youngfemale. There is no answer that I know of.  May I withdraw?\'Thus said the discreet Sosia, keeping his face muffled in his cloak, andspeaking with a feigned voice, so that he might not hereafter berecognized.\'By the gods--a pimp!  Unfeeling wretch!--do you not see my sorrows?Go! and the curses of Pandarus with you!\'Sosia lost not a moment in retiring.\'Will you read the letter, Sallust?\' said the freedman.\'Letter!--which letter?\' said the epicure, reeling, for he began to seedouble.  \'A curse on these wenches, say I!  Am I a man to thinkof--(hiccup)--pleasure, when--when--my friend is going to be eat up?\'\'Eat another tartlet.\'\'No, no!  My grief chokes me!\'\'Take him to bed,\' said the freedman; and, Sallust\'s head now decliningfairly on his breast, they bore him off to his cubiculum, stillmuttering lamentations for Glaucus, and imprecations on the unfeelingovertures of ladies of pleasure.Meanwhile Sosia strode indignantly homeward.  \'Pimp, indeed!\' quoth heto himself.  \'Pimp! a scurvy-tongued fellow that Sallust!  Had I beencalled knave, or thief.  I could have forgiven it; but pimp!  Faugh!There is something in the word which the toughest stomach in the worldwould rise against.  A knave is a knave for his own pleasure, and athief a thief for his own profit; and there is something honorable andphilosophical in being a rascal for one\'s own sake: that is doing thingsupon principle--upon a grand scale.  But a pimp is a thing that defilesitself for another--a pipkin that is put on the fire for another man\'spottage! a napkin, that every guest wipes his hands upon! and thescullion says, ""by your leave"" too. A pimp!  I would rather he had calledme parricide!  But the man was drunk, and did not know what he said;and, besides, I disguised myself.  Had he seen it had been Sosia whoaddressed him, it would have been ""honest Sosia!"" and, ""worthy man!"" Iwarrant.  Nevertheless, the trinkets have been won easily--that\'s somecomfort! and, O goddess Feronia!  I shall be a freedman soon! and then Ishould like to see who\'ll call me pimp!--unless, indeed, he pay mepretty handsomely for it!\'While Sosia was soliloquising in this high-minded and generous vein, hispath lay along a narrow lane that led towards the amphitheatre and itsadjacent palaces.  Suddenly, as he turned a sharp corner he foundhimself in the midst of a considerable crowd. Men, women, and children,all were hurrying or laughing, talking, gesticulating; and, ere he wasaware of it, the worthy Sosia was borne away with the noisy stream.\'What now?\' he asked of his nearest neighbor, a young artificer; \'whatnow? Where are all these good folks thronging?\' Does any rich patrongive away alms or viands to-night?\'\'Not so, man--better still,\' replied the artificer; \'the noblePansa--the people\'s friend--has granted the public leave to see thebeasts in their vivaria.  By Hercules! they will not be seen so safelyby some persons to-morrow.\'\'Tis a pretty sight,\' said the slave, yielding to the throng thatimpelled him onward; \'and since I may not go to the sports to-morrow, Imay as well take a peep at the beasts to-night.\'\'You will do well,\' returned his new acquaintance, \'a lion and a tigerare not to be seen at Pompeii every day.\'The crowd had now entered a broken and wide space of ground, on which,as it was only lighted scantily and from a distance, the press becamedangerous to those whose limbs and shoulders were not fitted for a mob.Nevertheless, the women especially--many of them with children in theirarms, or even at the breast--were the most resolute in forcing theirway; and their shrill exclamations of complaint or objurgation wereheard loud above the more jovial and masculine voices.  Yet, amidst themwas a young and girlish voice, that appeared to come from one too happyin her excitement to be alive to the inconvenience of the crowd.\'Aha!\' cried the young woman, to some of her companions, \'I always toldyou so; I always said we should have a man for the lion; and now we haveone for the tiger too!  I wish tomorrow were come!\'       Ho, ho! for the merry, merry show,        With a forest of faces in every row!        Lo! the swordsmen, bold as the son of Alcmaena,        Sweep, side by side, o\'er the hushed arena.        Talk while you may, you will hold your breath        When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death!        Tramp! tramp! how gaily they go!        Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show!\'A jolly girl!\' said Sosia.\'Yes,\' replied the young artificer, a curly-headed, handsome youth.\'Yes,\' replied he, enviously; \'the women love a gladiator.  If I hadbeen a slave, I would have soon found my schoolmaster in the lanista!\'\'Would you, indeed?\' said Sosia, with a sneer.  \'People\'s notionsdiffer!\'The crowd had now arrived at the place of destination; but as the cellin which the wild beasts were confined was extremely small and narrow,tenfold more vehement than it hitherto had been was the rush of theaspirants to obtain admittance.  Two of the officers of theamphitheatre, placed at the entrance, very wisely mitigated the evil bydispensing to the foremost only a limited number of tickets at a time,and admitting no new visitors till their predecessors had sated theircuriosity.  Sosia, who was a tolerably stout fellow and not troubledwith any remarkable scruples of diffidence or good breeding, contrivedto be among the first of the initiated.Separated from his companion the artificer, Sosia found himself in anarrow cell of oppressive heat and atmosphere, and lighted by severalrank and flaring torches.The animals, usually kept in different vivaria, or dens, were now, forthe greater entertainment of the visitors, placed in one, but equallyindeed divided from each other by strong cages protected by iron bars.There they were, the fell and grim wanderers of the desert, who have nowbecome almost the principal agents of this story.  The lion, who, asbeing the more gentle by nature than his fellow-beast, had been moreincited to ferocity by hunger, stalked restlessly and fiercely to andfro his narrow confines: his eyes were lurid with rage and famine: andas, every now and then, he paused and glared around, the spectatorsfearfully pressed backward, and drew their breath more quickly.  But thetiger lay quiet and extended at full length in his cage, and only by anoccasional play of his tail, or a long impatient yawn, testified anyemotion at his confinement, or at the crowd which honored him with theirpresence.\'I have seen no fiercer beast than yon lion even in the amphitheatre ofRome,\' said a gigantic and sinewy fellow who stood at the right hand ofSosia.\'I feel humbled when I look at his limbs,\' replied, at the left ofSosia, a slighter and younger figure, with his arms folded on hisbreast.The slave looked first at one, and then at the other.  \'Virtus inmedio!--virtue is ever in the middle!\' muttered he to himself; \'a goodlyneighborhood for thee, Sosia--a gladiator on each side!\'\'That is well said, Lydon,\' returned the huger gladiator; \'I feel thesame.\'\'And to think,\' observed Lydon, in a tone of deep feeling, \'to think thatthe noble Greek, he whom we saw but a day or two since before us, sofull of youth, and health, and joyousness, is to feast yon monster!\'\'Why not?\' growled Niger, savagely: \'many an honest gladiator has beencompelled to a like combat by the emperor--why not a wealthy murderer bythe law?\'Lydon sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and remained silent. Meanwhile thecommon gazers listened with staring eyes and lips apart: the gladiatorswere objects of interest as well as the beasts--they were animals of thesame species; so the crowd glanced from one to the other--the men andthe brutes--whispering their comments and anticipating the morrow.\'Well!\' said Lydon, turning away, \'I thank the gods that it is not thelion or the tiger I am to contend with; even you, Niger, are a gentlercombatant than they.\'\'But equally dangerous,\' said the gladiator, with a fierce laugh; andthe bystanders, admiring his vast limbs and ferocious countenance,laughed too.\'That as it may be,\' answered Lydon, carelessly, as he pressed throughthe throng and quitted the den.\'I may as well take advantage of his shoulders,\' thought the prudentSosia, hastening to follow him: \'the crowd always give way to agladiator, so I will keep close behind, and come in for a share of hisconsequence.\'The son of Medon strode quickly through the mob, many of whom recognizedhis features and profession.\'That is young Lydon, a brave fellow: he fights to-morrow,\' said one.\'Ah! I have a bet on him,\' said another; \'see how firmly he walks!\'\'Good luck to thee, Lydon!\' said a third.\'Lydon, you have my wishes,\' half whispered a fourth, smiling (a comelywoman of the middle class)--\'and if you win, why, you may hear more ofme.\'\'A handsome man, by Venus!\' cried a fifth, who was a girl scarce in herteens.  \'Thank you,\' returned Sosia, gravely taking the compliment tohimself.However strong the purer motives of Lydon, and certain though it be thathe would never have entered so bloody a calling but from the hope ofobtaining his father\'s freedom, he was not altogether unmoved by thenotice he excited.  He forgot that the voices now raised in commendationmight, on the morrow, shout over his death-pangs.  By nature fierce andreckless, as well as generous and warm-hearted, he was already imbuedwith the pride of a profession that he fancied he disdained, andaffected by the influence of a companionship that in reality he loathed.He saw himself now a man of importance; his step grew yet lighter, andhis mien more elate.\'Niger,\' said he, turning suddenly, as he had now threaded the crowd;\'we have often quarrelled; we are not matched against each other, butone of us, at least, may reasonably expect to fall--give us thy hand.\'\'Most readily,\' said Sosia, extending his palm.\'Ha! what fool is this?  Why, I thought Niger was at my heels!\'\'I forgive the mistake,\' replied Sosia, condescendingly: \'don\'t mentionit; the error was easy--I and Niger are somewhat of the same build.\'\'Ha! ha! that is excellent!  Niger would have slit thy throat had heheard thee!\'\'You gentlemen of the arena have a most disagreeable mode of talking,\'said Sosia; \'let us change the conversation.\'\'Vah! vah!\' said Lydon, impatiently; \'I am in no humor to converse withthee!\'\'Why, truly,\' returned the slave, \'you must have serious thoughts enoughto occupy your mind: to-morrow is, I think, your first essay in thearena. Well, I am sure you will die bravely!\'\'May thy words fall on thine own head!\' said Lydon, superstitiously, forhe by no means liked the blessing of Sosia.  \'Die! No--I trust my houris not yet come.\'\'He who plays at dice with death must expect the dog\'s throw,\' repliedSosia, maliciously.  \'But you are a strong fellow, and I wish you allimaginable luck; and so, vale!\'With that the slave turned on his heel, and took his way homeward.\'I trust the rogue\'s words are not ominous,\' said Lydon, musingly. \'Inmy zeal for my father\'s liberty, and my confidence in my own thews andsinews, I have not contemplated the possibility of death.  My poorfather!  I am thy only son!--if I were to fall...\'As the thought crossed him, the gladiator strode on with a more rapidand restless pace, when suddenly, in an opposite street, he beheld thevery object of his thoughts.  Leaning on his stick, his form bent bycare and age, his eyes downcast, and his steps trembling, thegrey-haired Medon slowly approached towards the gladiator.  Lydon pauseda moment: he divined at once the cause that brought forth the old man atthat late hour.\'Be sure, it is I whom he seeks,\' thought he; \'he is horror struck atthe condemnation of Olinthus--he more than ever esteems the arenacriminal and hateful--he comes again to dissuade me from the contest.  Imust shun him--I cannot brook his prayers--his tears.\'These thoughts, so long to recite, flashed across the young man likelightning.  He turned abruptly and fled swiftly in an oppositedirection. He paused not till, almost spent and breathless, he foundhimself on the summit of a small acclivity which overlooked the most gayand splendid part of that miniature city; and as there he paused, andgazed along the tranquil streets glittering in the rays of the moon(which had just arisen, and brought partially and picturesquely intolight the crowd around the amphitheatre at a distance, murmuring, andswaying to and fro), the influence of the scene affected him, rude andunimaginative though his nature.  He sat himself down to rest upon thesteps of a deserted portico, and felt the calm of the hour quiet andrestore him.  Opposite and near at hand, the lights gleamed from apalace in which the master now held his revels.  The doors were open forcoolness, and the gladiator beheld the numerous and festive groupgathered round the tables in the atrium; while behind them, closing thelong vista of the illumined rooms beyond, the spray of the distantfountain sparkled in the moonbeams. There, the garlands wreathed aroundthe columns of the hall--there, gleamed still and frequent the marblestatue--there, amidst peals of jocund laughter, rose the music and thelay.              EPICUREAN SONG       Away with your stories of Hades,          Which the Flamen has forged to affright us--       We laugh at your three Maiden Ladies,          Your Fates--and your sullen Cocytus.       Poor Jove has a troublesome life, sir,          Could we credit your tales of his portals--       In shutting his ears on his wife, sir,          And opening his eyes upon mortals.       Oh, blest be the bright Epicurus!          Who taught us to laugh at such fables;        On Hades they wanted to moor us,          And his hand cut the terrible cables.       If, then, there\'s a Jove or a Juno,          They vex not their heads about us, man;        Besides, if they did, I and you know          \'Tis the life of a god to live thus, man!       What! think you the gods place their bliss--eh?--         In playing the spy on a sinner?        In counting the girls that we kiss, eh?          Or the cups that we empty at dinner?       Content with the soft lips that love us,          This music, this wine, and this mirth, boys,        We care not for gods up above us--         We know there\'s no god for this earth, boys!While Lydon\'s piety (which accommodating as it might be, was in noslight degree disturbed by these verses, which embodied the fashionablephilosophy of the day) slowly recovered itself from the shock it hadreceived, a small party of men, in plain garments and of the middleclass, passed by his resting-place.  They were in earnest conversation,and did not seem to notice or heed the gladiator as they moved on.\'O horror on horrors!\' said one; \'Olinthus is snatched from us! ourright arm is lopped away!  When will Christ descend to protect his own?\'\'Can human atrocity go farther,\' said another: \'to sentence an innocentman to the same arena as a murderer!  But let us not despair; thethunder of Sinai may yet be heard, and the Lord preserve his saint.""The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.""\'At that moment out broke again, from the illumined palace, the burden ofthe reveller\'s song:--    We care not for gods up above us--       We know there\'s no god for this earth, boys!Ere the words died away, the Nazarenes, moved by sudden indignation,caught up the echo, and, in the words of one of their favorite hymns,shouted aloud:--        THE WARNING HYMN OF THE NAZARENES       Around--about--for ever near thee,        God--OUR GOD--shall mark and hear thee!        On his car of storm He sweeps!        Bow, ye heavens, and shrink, ye deeps!        Woe to the proud ones who defy Him!--       Woe to the dreamers who deny Him!            Woe to the wicked, woe!          The proud stars shall fail--         The sun shall grow pale--       The heavens shrivel up like a scroll--         Hell\'s ocean shall bare          Its depths of despair,        Each wave an eternal soul!          For the only thing, then,          That shall not live again            Is the corpse of the giant TIME.           Hark, the trumpet of thunder!           Lo, earth rent asunder!         And, forth, on His Angel-throne,           He comes through the gloom,           The Judge of the Tomb,         To summon and save His own!              Oh, joy to Care, and woe to Crime,              He comes to save His own!        Woe to the proud ones who defy Him!        Woe to the dreamers who deny Him!              Woe to the wicked, woe!A sudden silence from the startled hall of revel succeeded these ominouswords: the Christians swept on, and were soon hidden from the sight ofthe gladiator.  Awed, he scarce knew why, by the mystic denunciations ofthe Christians, Lydon, after a short pause, now rose to pursue his wayhomeward.Before him, how serenely slept the starlight on that lovely city! howbreathlessly its pillared streets reposed in their security!--how softlyrippled the dark-green waves beyond!--how cloudless spread, aloft andblue, the dreaming Campanian skies!  Yet this was the last night for thegay Pompeii! the colony of the hoar Chaldean! the fabled city ofHercules! the delight of the voluptuous Roman!  Age after age hadrolled, indestructive, unheeded, over its head; and now the last rayquivered on the dial-plate of its doom!  The gladiator heard some lightsteps behind--a group of females were wending homeward from their visitto the amphitheatre.  As he turned, his eye was arrested by a strangeand sudden apparition.  From the summit of Vesuvius, darkly visible atthe distance, there shot a pale, meteoric, livid light--it trembled aninstant and was gone.  And at the same moment that his eye caught it,the voice of one of the youngest of the women broke out hilariously andshrill:--       TRAMP! TRAMP! HOW GAILY THEY GO!        HO, HO! FOR THE MORROW\'S MERRY SHOW!BOOK THE FIFTHChapter ITHE DREAM OF ARBACES.  A VISITOR AND A WARNING TO THE EGYPTIAN.THE awful night preceding the fierce joy of the amphitheatre rolleddrearily away, and greyly broke forth the dawn of THE LAST DAY OFPOMPEII!  The air was uncommonly calm and sultry--a thin and dull mistgathered over the valleys and hollows of the broad Campanian fields.But yet it was remarked in surprise by the early fishermen, that,despite the exceeding stillness of the atmosphere, the waves of the seawere agitated, and seemed, as it were, to run disturbedly back from theshore; while along the blue and stately Sarnus, whose ancient breadth ofchannel the traveler now vainly seeks to discover, there crept a hoarseand sullen murmur, as it glided by the laughing plains and the gaudyvillas of the wealthy citizens.  Clear above the low mist rose thetime-worn towers of the immemorial town, the red-tiled roofs of thebright streets, the solemn columns of many temples, and thestatue-crowned portals of the Forum and the Arch of Triumph.  Far in thedistance, the outline of the circling hills soared above the vapors, andmingled with the changeful hues of the morning sky.  The cloud that hadso long rested over the crest of Vesuvius had suddenly vanished, and itsrugged and haughty brow looked without a frown over the beautiful scenesbelow.Despite the earliness of the hour, the gates of the city were alreadyopened.  Horsemen upon horsemen, vehicle after vehicle, poured rapidlyin; and the voices of numerous pedestrian groups, clad in holidayattire, rose high in joyous and excited merriment; the streets werecrowded with citizens and strangers from the populous neighborhood ofPompeii; and noisily--fast--confusedly swept the many streams of lifetowards the fatal show.Despite the vast size of the amphitheatre, seemingly so disproportionedto the extent of the city, and formed to include nearly the wholepopulation of Pompeii itself, so great, on extraordinary occasions, wasthe concourse of strangers from all parts of Campania, that the spacebefore it was usually crowded for several hours previous to thecommencement of the sports, by such persons as were not entitled bytheir rank to appointed and special seats.  And the intense curiositywhich the trial and sentence of two criminals so remarkable hadoccasioned, increased the crowd on this day to an extent whollyunprecedented.While the common people, with the lively vehemence of their Campanianblood, were thus pushing, scrambling, hurrying on--yet, amidst all theireagerness, preserving, as is now the wont with Italians in suchmeetings, a wonderful order and unquarrelsome good humor, a strangevisitor to Arbaces was threading her way to his sequestered mansion.  Atthe sight of her quaint and primaeval garb--of her wild gait andgestures--the passengers she encountered touched each other and smiled;but as they caught a glimpse of her countenance, the mirth was hushed atonce, for the face was as the face of the dead; and, what with theghastly features and obsolete robes of the stranger, it seemed as if onelong entombed had risen once more amongst the living.  In silence andawe each group gave way as she passed along, and she soon gained thebroad porch of the Egyptian\'s palace.The black porter, like the rest of the world, astir at an unusual hour,started as he opened the door to her summons.The sleep of the Egyptian had been usually profound during the night;but, as the dawn approached, it was disturbed by strange and unquietdreams, which impressed him the more as they were colored by thepeculiar philosophy he embraced.He thought that he was transported to the bowels of the earth, and thathe stood alone in a mighty cavern supported by enormous columns of roughand primaeval rock, lost, as they ascended, in the vastness of a shadowathwart whose eternal darkness no beam of day had ever glanced.  And inthe space between these columns were huge wheels, that whirled round andround unceasingly, and with a rushing and roaring noise.  Only to theright and left extremities of the cavern, the space between the pillarswas left bare, and the apertures stretched away into galleries--notwholly dark, but dimly lighted by wandering and erratic fires, that,meteor-like, now crept (as the snake creeps) along the rugged and danksoil; and now leaped fiercely to and fro, darting across the vast gloomin wild gambols--suddenly disappearing, and as suddenly bursting intotenfold brilliancy and power.  And while he gazed wonderingly upon thegallery to the left, thin, mist-like, aerial shapes passed slowly up;and when they had gained the hall they seemed to rise aloft, and tovanish, as the smoke vanishes, in the measureless ascent.He turned in fear towards the opposite extremity--and behold! there cameswiftly, from the gloom above, similar shadows, which swept hurriedlyalong the gallery to the right, as if borne involuntarily adown thesides of some invisible stream; and the faces of these spectres weremore distinct than those that emerged from the opposite passage; and onsome was joy, and on others sorrow--some were vivid with expectation andhope, some unutterably dejected by awe and horror.  And so they passed,swift and constantly on, till the eyes of the gazer grew dizzy andblinded with the whirl of an ever-varying succession of things impelledby a power apparently not their own.Arbaces turned away, and, in the recess of the hall, he saw the mightyform of a giantess seated upon a pile of skulls, and her hands were busyupon a pale and shadowy woof; and he saw that the woof communicated withthe numberless wheels, as if it guided the machinery of their movements.He thought his feet, by some secret agency, were impelled towards thefemale, and that he was borne onwards till he stood before her, face toface.  The countenance of the giantess was solemn and hushed, andbeautifully serene. It was as the face of some colossal sculpture of hisown ancestral sphinx. No passion--no human emotion, disturbed itsbrooding and unwrinkled brow: there was neither sadness, nor joy, normemory, nor hope: it was free from all with which the wild human heartcan sympathize.  The mystery of mysteries rested on its beauty--it awed,but terrified not: it was the Incarnation of the sublime.  And Arbacesfelt the voice leave his lips, without an impulse of his own; and thevoice asked:\'Who art thou, and what is thy task?\'\'I am That which thou hast acknowledged,\' answered, without desistingfrom its work, the mighty phantom.  \'My name is NATURE!  These are thewheels of the world, and my hand guides them for the life of allthings.\'\'And what,\' said the voice of Arbaces, \'are these galleries, thatstrangely and fitfully illumined, stretch on either hand into the abyssof gloom?\'\'That,\' answered the giant-mother, \'which thou beholdest to the left, isthe gallery of the Unborn.  The shadows that flit onward and upward intothe world, are the souls that pass from the long eternity of being totheir destined pilgrimage on earth.  That which thou beholdest to thyright, wherein the shadows descending from above sweep on, equallyunknown and dim, is the gallery of the Dead!\'\'And wherefore, said the voice of Arbaces, \'yon wandering lights, thatso wildly break the darkness; but only break, not reveal?\'\'Dark fool of the human sciences! dreamer of the stars, and would-bedecipherer of the heart and origin of things! those lights are but theglimmerings of such knowledge as is vouchsafed to Nature to work herway, to trace enough of the past and future to give providence to herdesigns. Judge, then, puppet as thou art, what lights are reserved forthee!\'Arbaces felt himself tremble as he asked again, \'Wherefore am I here?\'\'It is the forecast of thy soul--the prescience of thy rushing doom--theshadow of thy fate lengthening into eternity as declines from earth.\'Ere he could answer, Arbaces felt a rushing WIND sweep down the cavern,as the winds of a giant god.  Borne aloft from the ground, and whirledon high as a leaf in the storms of autumn, he beheld himself in themidst of the Spectres of the Dead, and hurrying with them along thelength of gloom.  As in vain and impotent despair he struggled againstthe impelling power, he thought the WIND grew into something like ashape--a spectral outline of the wings and talons of an eagle, withlimbs floating far and indistinctly along the air, and eyes that, aloneclearly and vividly seen, glared stonily and remorselessly on his own.\'What art thou?\' again said the voice of the Egyptian.\'I am That which thou hast acknowledged\'; and the spectre laughedaloud--\'and my name is NECESSITY.\'\'To what dost thou bear me?\'\'To the Unknown.\'\'To happiness or to woe?\'\'As thou hast sown, so shalt thou reap.\'\'Dread thing, not so!  If thou art the Ruler of Life, thine are mymisdeeds, not mine.\'\'I am but the breath of God!\' answered the mighty WIND.\'Then is my wisdom vain!\' groaned the dreamer.\'The husbandman accuses not fate, when, having sown thistles, he reapsnot corn.  Thou hast sown crime, accuse not fate if thou reapest not theharvest of virtue.\'The scene suddenly changed.  Arbaces was in a place of human bones; andlo! in the midst of them was a skull, and the skull, still retaining itsfleshless hollows, assumed slowly, and in the mysterious confusion of adream, the face of Apaecides; and forth from the grinning jaws therecrept a small worm, and it crawled to the feet of Arbaces.  He attemptedto stamp on it and crush it; but it became longer and larger with thatattempt.  It swelled and bloated till it grew into a vast serpent: itcoiled itself round the limbs of Arbaces; it crunched his bones; itraised its glaring eyes and poisonous jaws to his face.  He writhed invain; he withered--he gasped--beneath the influence of the blightingbreath--he felt himself blasted into death. And then a voice came fromthe reptile, which still bore the face of Apaecides and rang in hisreeling ear:\'THY VICTIM IS THY JUDGE!  THE WORM THOU WOULDST CRUSH BECOMES THESERPENT THAT DEVOURS THEE!\'With a shriek of wrath, and woe, and despairing resistance, Arbacesawoke--his hair on end--his brow bathed in dew--his eyes glazed andstaring--his mighty frame quivering as an infant\'s, beneath the agony ofthat dream.  He awoke--he collected himself--he blessed the gods whom hedisbelieved, that he was in a dream--he turned his eyes from side toside--he saw the dawning light break through his small but loftywindow--he was in the Precincts of Day--he rejoiced--he smiled; his eyesfell, and opposite to him he beheld the ghastly features, the lifelesseye, the livid lip--of the hag of Vesuvius!\'Ha!\' he cried, placing his hands before his eyes, as to shut out thegrisly vision, \'do I dream still?--Am I with the dead?\'\'Mighty Hermes--no!  Thou art with one death-like, but not dead.Recognize thy friend and slave.\'There was a long silence.  Slowly the shudders that passed over thelimbs of the Egyptian chased each other away, faintlier and faintlierdying till he was himself again.\'It was a dream, then,\' said he.  \'Well--let me dream no more, or theday cannot compensate for the pangs of night.  Woman, how camest thouhere, and wherefore?\'\'I came to warn thee,\' answered the sepulchral voice of the saga.\'Warn me!  The dream lied not, then?  Of what peril?\'\'Listen to me.  Some evil hangs over this fated city.  Fly while it betime. Thou knowest that I hold my home on that mountain beneath whichold tradition saith there yet burn the fires of the river of Phlegethon;and in my cavern is a vast abyss, and in that abyss I have of latemarked a red and dull stream creep slowly, slowly on; and heard many andmighty sounds hissing and roaring through the gloom.  But last night, asI looked thereon, behold the stream was no longer dull, but intenselyand fiercely luminous; and while I gazed, the beast that liveth with me,and was cowering by my side, uttered a shrill howl, and fell down anddied, and the slaver and froth were round his lips.  I crept back to mylair; but I distinctly heard, all the night, the rock shake and tremble;and, though the air was heavy and still, there were the hissing of pentwinds, and the grinding as of wheels, beneath the ground.  So, when Irose this morning at the very birth of dawn, I looked again down theabyss, and I saw vast fragments of stone borne black and floatingly overthe lurid stream; and the stream itself was broader, fiercer, redderthan the night before.  Then I went forth, and ascended to the summit ofthe rock: and in that summit there appeared a sudden and vast hollow,which I had never perceived before, from which curled a dim, faintsmoke; and the vapor was deathly, and I gasped, and sickened, and nearlydied.  I returned home.  I took my gold and my drugs, and left thehabitation of many years; for I remembered the dark Etruscan prophecywhich saith, ""When the mountain opens, the city shall fall--when thesmoke crowns the Hill of the Parched Fields, there shall be woe andweeping in the hearths of the Children of the Sea."" Dread master, ere Ileave these walls for some more distant dwelling, I come to thee.  Asthou livest, know I in my heart that the earthquake that sixteen yearsago shook this city to its solid base, was but the forerunner of moredeadly doom.  The walls of Pompeii are built above the fields of theDead, and the rivers of the sleepless Hell.  Be warned and fly!\'\'Witch, I thank thee for thy care of one not ungrateful.  On yon tablestands a cup of gold; take it, it is thine.  I dreamt not that therelived one, out of the priesthood of Isis, who would have saved Arbacesfrom destruction.  The signs thou hast seen in the bed of the extinctvolcano,\' continued the Egyptian, musingly, \'surely tell of some comingdanger to the city; perhaps another earthquake--fiercer than the last.Be that as it may, there is a new reason for my hastening from thesewalls.  After this day I will prepare my departure.  Daughter ofEtruria, whither wendest thou?\'\'I shall cross over to Herculaneum this day, and, wandering thence alongthe coast, shall seek out a new home.  I am friendless: my twocompanions, the fox and the snake, are dead.  Great Hermes, thou hastpromised me twenty additional years of life!\'\'Aye,\' said the Egyptian, \'I have promised thee.  But, woman,\' he added,lifting himself upon his arm, and gazing curiously on her face, \'tellme, I pray thee, wherefore thou wishest to live?  What sweets dost thoudiscover in existence?\'\'It is not life that is sweet, but death that is awful,\' replied thehag, in a sharp, impressive tone, that struck forcibly upon the heart ofthe vain star-seer.  He winced at the truth of the reply; and no longeranxious to retain so uninviting a companion, he said, \'Time wanes; Imust prepare for the solemn spectacle of this day. Sister, farewell!enjoy thyself as thou canst over the ashes of life.\'The hag, who had placed the costly gift of Arbaces in the loose folds ofher vest, now rose to depart.  When she had gained the door she paused,turned back, and said, \'This may be the last time we meet on earth; butwhither flieth the flame when it leaves the ashes?--Wandering to andfro, up and down, as an exhalation on the morass, the flame may be seenin the marshes of the lake below; and the witch and the Magian, thepupil and the master, the great one and the accursed one, may meetagain.  Farewell!\'\'Out, croaker!\' muttered Arbaces, as the door closed on the hag\'stattered robes; and, impatient of his own thoughts, not yet recoveredfrom the past dream, he hastily summoned his slaves.It was the custom to attend the ceremonials of the amphitheatre infestive robes, and Arbaces arrayed himself that day with more than usualcare.  His tunic was of the most dazzling white: his many fibulae wereformed from the most precious stones: over his tunic flowed a looseeastern robe, half-gown, half-mantle, glowing in the richest hues of theTyrian dye; and the sandals, that reached half way up the knee, werestudded with gems, and inlaid with gold.  In the quackeries thatbelonged to his priestly genius, Arbaces never neglected, on greatoccasions, the arts which dazzle and impose upon the vulgar; and on thisday, that was for ever to release him, by the sacrifice of Glaucus, fromthe fear of a rival and the chance of detection, he felt that he wasarraying himself as for a triumph or a nuptial feast.It was customary for men of rank to be accompanied to the shows of theamphitheatre by a procession of their slaves and freedmen; and the long\'family\' of Arbaces were already arranged in order, to attend the litterof their lord.Only, to their great chagrin, the slaves in attendance on Ione, and theworthy Sosia, as gaoler to Nydia, were condemned to remain at home.\'Callias,\' said Arbaces, apart to his freedman, who was buckling on hisgirdle, \'I am weary of Pompeii; I propose to quit it in three days,should the wind favor.  Thou knowest the vessel that lies in the harborwhich belonged to Narses, of Alexandria; I have purchased it of him.The day after tomorrow we shall begin to remove my stores.\'\'So soon!  \'Tis well.  Arbaces shall be obeyed--and his ward, Ione?\'\'Accompanies me.  Enough!--Is the morning fair?\'\'Dim and oppressive; it will probably be intensely hot in the forenoon.\'\'The poor gladiators, and more wretched criminals!  Descend, and seethat the slaves are marshalled.\'Left alone, Arbaces stepped into his chamber of study, and thence uponthe portico without.  He saw the dense masses of men pouring fast intothe amphitheatre, and heard the cry of the assistants, and the crackingof the cordage, as they were straining aloft the huge awning under whichthe citizens, molested by no discomforting ray, were to behold, atluxurious ease, the agonies of their fellow creatures.  Suddenly a wildstrange sound went forth, and as suddenly died away--it was the roar ofthe lion.  There was a silence in the distant crowd; but the silence wasfollowed by joyous laughter--they were making merry at the hungryimpatience of the royal beast.\'Brutes!\' muttered the disdainful, \'Arbaces are ye less homicides than Iam? I slay but in self-defence--ye make murder pastime.\'He turned with a restless and curious eye, towards Vesuvius. Beautifullyglowed the green vineyards round its breast, and tranquil as eternitylay in the breathless skies the form of the mighty hill.\'We have time yet, if the earthquake be nursing,\' thought Arbaces; andhe turned from the spot.  He passed by the table which bore his mysticscrolls and Chaldean calculations.\'August art!\' he thought, \'I have not consulted thy decrees since Ipassed the danger and the crisis they foretold.  What matter?--I knowthat henceforth all in my path is bright and smooth. Have not eventsalready proved it?  Away, doubt--away, pity!  Reflect O my heart--reflect, for the future, but two images--Empire and Ione!\'Chapter IITHE AMPHITHEATRE.NYDIA, assured by the account of Sosia, on his return home, andsatisfied that her letter was in the hands of Sallust, gave herself uponce more to hope.  Sallust would surely lose no time in seeking thepraetor--in coming to the house of the Egyptian--in releasing her--inbreaking the prison of Calenus.  That very night Glaucus would be free.Alas! the night passed--the dawn broke; she heard nothing but thehurried footsteps of the slaves along the hall and peristyle, and theirvoices in preparation for the show.  By-and-by, the commanding voice ofArbaces broke on her ear--a flourish of music rung out cheerily: thelong procession were sweeping to the amphitheatre to glut their eyes onthe death-pangs of the Athenian!The procession of Arbaces moved along slowly, and with much solemnitytill now, arriving at the place where it was necessary for such as camein litters or chariots to alight, Arbaces descended from his vehicle,and proceeded to the entrance by which the more distinguished spectatorswere admitted.  His slaves, mingling with the humbler crowd, werestationed by officers who received their tickets (not much unlike ourmodern Opera ones), in places in the popularia (the seats apportioned tothe vulgar).  And now, from the spot where Arbaces sat, his eyes scannedthe mighty and impatient crowd that filled the stupendous theatre.On the upper tier (but apart from the male spectators) sat women, theirgay dresses resembling some gaudy flower-bed; it is needless to add thatthey were the most talkative part of the assembly; and many were thelooks directed up to them, especially from the benches appropriated tothe young and the unmarried men.  On the lower seats round the arena satthe more high-born and wealthy visitors--the magistrates and those ofsenatorial or equestrian dignity; the passages which, by corridors atthe right and left, gave access to these seats, at either end of theoval arena, were also the entrances for the combatants.  Strong palingsat these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the movementsof the beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey.  Around theparapet which was raised above the arena, and from which the seatsgradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and paintings wrought infresco, typical of the entertainments for which the place was designed.Throughout the whole building wound invisible pipes, from which, as theday advanced, cooling and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over thespectators.  The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in thetask of fixing the vast awning (or velaria) which covered the whole, andwhich luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to themselves: it waswoven of the whitest Apulian wool, and variegated with broad stripes ofcrimson.  Owing either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen,or to some defect in the machinery, the awning, however, was notarranged that day so happily as usual; indeed, from the immense space ofthe circumference, the task was always one of great difficulty andart--so much so, that it could seldom be adventured in rough or windyweather.  But the present day was so remarkably still that there seemedto the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers; andwhen a large gap in the back of the awning was still visible, from theobstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with therest, the murmurs of discontent were loud and general.The aedile Pansa, at whose expense the exhibition was given, lookedparticularly annoyed at the defect, and, vowed bitter vengeance on thehead of the chief officer of the show, who, fretting, puffing,perspiring, busied himself in idle orders and unavailing threats.The hubbub ceased suddenly--the operators desisted--the crowd werestilled--the gap was forgotten--for now, with a loud and warlikeflourish of trumpets, the gladiators, marshalled in ceremoniousprocession, entered the arena.  They swept round the oval space veryslowly and deliberately, in order to give the spectators full leisure toadmire their stern serenity of feature--their brawny limbs and variousarms, as well as to form such wagers as the excitement of the momentmight suggest.\'Oh!\' cried the widow Fulvia to the wife of Pansa, as they leaned downfrom their lofty bench, \'do you see that gigantic gladiator? how drollyhe is dressed!\'\'Yes,\' said the aedile\'s wife, with complacent importance, for she knewall the names and qualities of each combatant; \'he is a retiarius ornetter; he is armed only, you see, with a three-pronged spear like atrident, and a net; he wears no armor, only the fillet and the tunic.He is a mighty man, and is to fight with Sporus, yon thick-setgladiator, with the round shield and drawn sword, but without bodyarmor; he has not his helmet on now, in order that you may see hisface--how fearless it is!--by-and-by he will fight with his vizor down.\'\'But surely a net and a spear are poor arms against a shield and sword?\'\'That shows how innocent you are, my dear Fulvia; the retiarius hasgenerally the best of it.\'\'But who is yon handsome gladiator, nearly naked--is it not quiteimproper? By Venus! but his limbs are beautifully shaped!\'\'It is Lydon, a young untried man! he has the rashness to fight yonother gladiator similarly dressed, or rather undressed--Tetraides. Theyfight first in the Greek fashion, with the cestus; afterwards they puton armor, and try sword and shield.\'\'He is a proper man, this Lydon; and the women, I am sure, are on hisside.\'\'So are not the experienced betters; Clodius offers three to one againsthim!\'\'Oh, Jove! how beautiful!\' exclaimed the widow, as two gladiators, armedcap-a-pie, rode round the arena on light and prancing steeds. Resemblingmuch the combatants in the tilts of the middle age, they bore lances andround shields beautifully inlaid: their armor was woven intricately withbands of iron, but it covered only the thighs and the right arms; shortcloaks, extending to the seat, gave a picturesque and graceful air totheir costume; their legs were naked, with the exception of sandals,which were fastened a little above the ankle.  \'Oh, beautiful!  Who arethese?\' asked the widow.\'The one is named Berbix--he has conquered twelve times; the otherassumes the arrogant name of Nobilior.  They are both Gauls.\'While thus conversing, the first formalities of the show were over.  Tothese succeeded a feigned combat with wooden swords between the variousgladiators matched against each other.  Amongst these, the skill of twoRoman gladiators, hired for the occasion, was the most admired; and nextto them the most graceful combatant was Lydon.  This sham contest didnot last above an hour, nor did it attract any very lively interest,except among those connoisseurs of the arena to whom art was preferableto more coarse excitement; the body of the spectators were rejoiced whenit was over, and when the sympathy rose to terror.  The combatants werenow arranged in pairs, as agreed beforehand; their weapons examined; andthe grave sports of the day commenced amidst the deepest silence--brokenonly by an exciting and preliminary blast of warlike music.It was often customary to begin the sports by the most cruel of all, andsome bestiarius, or gladiator appointed to the beasts, was slain first,as an initiatory sacrifice.  But in the present instance, theexperienced Pansa thought it better that the sanguinary drama shouldadvance, not decrease, in interest and, accordingly, the execution ofOlinthus and Glaucus was reserved for the last.  It was arranged thatthe two horsemen should first occupy the arena; that the footgladiators, paired off, should then be loosed indiscriminately on thestage; that Glaucus and the lion should next perform their part in thebloody spectacle; and the tiger and the Nazarene be the grand finale.And, in the spectacles of Pompeii, the reader of Roman history mustlimit his imagination, nor expect to find those vast and wholesaleexhibitions of magnificent slaughter with which a Nero or a Caligularegaled the inhabitants of the Imperial City.  The Roman shows, whichabsorbed the more celebrated gladiators, and the chief proportion offoreign beasts, were indeed the very reason why, in the lesser towns ofthe empire, the sports of the amphitheatre were comparatively humane andrare; and in this, as in other respects, Pompeii was but the miniature,the microcosm of Rome.  Still, it was an awful and imposing spectacle,with which modern times have, happily, nothing to compare--a vasttheatre, rising row upon row, and swarming with human beings, fromfifteen to eighteen thousand in number, intent upon no fictitiousrepresentation--no tragedy of the stage--but the actual victory ordefeat, the exultant life or the bloody death, of each and all whoentered the arena!The two horsemen were now at either extremity of the lists (if so theymight be called); and, at a given signal from Pansa, the combatantsstarted simultaneously as in full collision, each advancing his roundbuckler, each poising on high his light yet sturdy javelin; but justwhen within three paces of his opponent, the steed of Berbix suddenlyhalted, wheeled round, and, as Nobilior was borne rapidly by, hisantagonist spurred upon him.  The buckler of Nobilior, quickly andskillfully extended, received a blow which otherwise would have beenfatal.\'Well done, Nobilior!\' cried the praetor, giving the first vent to thepopular excitement.\'Bravely struck, my Berbix!\' answered Clodius from his seat.And the wild murmur, swelled by many a shout, echoed from side to side.The vizors of both the horsemen were completely closed (like those ofthe knights in after times), but the head was, nevertheless, the greatpoint of assault; and Nobilior, now wheeling his charger with no lessadroitness than his opponent, directed his spear full on the helmet ofhis foe.  Berbix raised his buckler to shield himself, and hisquick-eyed antagonist, suddenly lowering his weapon, pierced him throughthe breast.  Berbix reeled and fell.\'Nobilior! Nobilior!\' shouted the populace.\'I have lost ten sestertia,\' said Clodius, between his teeth.\'Habet!--he has it,\' said Pansa, deliberately.The populace, not yet hardened into cruelty, made the signal of mercy;but as the attendants of the arena approached, they found the kindnesscame too late--the heart of the Gaul had been pierced, and his eyes wereset in death.  It was his life\'s blood that flowed so darkly over thesand and sawdust of the arena.\'It is a pity it was so soon over--there was little enough for one\'strouble,\' said the widow Fulvia.\'Yes--I have no compassion for Berbix.  Any one might have seen thatNobilior did but feint.  Mark, they fix the fatal hook to the body--theydrag him away to the spoliarium--they scatter new sand over the stage!Pansa regrets nothing more than that he is not rich enough to strew thearena with borax and cinnabar, as Nero used to do.\'\'Well, if it has been a brief battle, it is quickly succeeded.  See myhandsome Lydon on the arena--ay--and the net-bearer too, and theswordsmen! oh, charming!\'There were now on the arena six combatants: Niger and his net, matchedagainst Sporus with his shield and his short broadsword; Lydon andTetraides, naked save by a cincture round the waist, each armed onlywith a heavy Greek cestus--and two gladiators from Rome, clad incomplete steel, and evenly matched with immense bucklers and pointedswords.The initiatory contest between Lydon and Tetraides being less deadlythan that between the other combatants, no sooner had they advanced tothe middle of the arena than, as by common consent, the rest held back,to see how that contest should be decided, and wait till fiercer weaponsmight replace the cestus, ere they themselves commenced hostilities.They stood leaning on their arms and apart from each other, gazing onthe show, which, if not bloody enough, thoroughly to please thepopulace, they were still inclined to admire, because its origin was oftheir ancestral Greece.No person could, at first glance, have seemed less evenly matched thanthe two antagonists.  Tetraides, though not taller than Lydon, weighedconsiderably more; the natural size of his muscles was increased, to theeyes of the vulgar, by masses of solid flesh; for, as it was a notionthat the contest of the cestus fared easiest with him who was plumpest,Tetraides had encouraged to the utmost his hereditary predisposition tothe portly. His shoulders were vast, and his lower limbs thick-set,double-jointed, and slightly curved outward, in that formation whichtakes so much from beauty to give so largely to strength.  But Lydon,except that he was slender even almost to meagreness, was beautifullyand delicately proportioned; and the skilful might have perceived that,with much less compass of muscle than his foe, that which he had wasmore seasoned--iron and compact.  In proportion, too, as he wantedflesh, he was likely to possess activity; and a haughty smile on hisresolute face which strongly contrasted the solid heaviness of hisenemy\'s, gave assurance to those who beheld it, and united their hope totheir pity: so that, despite the disparity of their seeming strength,the cry of the multitude was nearly as loud for Lydon as for Tetraides.Whoever is acquainted with the modern prize-ring--whoever has witnessedthe heavy and disabling strokes which the human fist, skillfullydirected, hath the power to bestow--may easily understand how much thathappy facility would be increased by a band carried by thongs of leatherround the arm as high as the elbow, and terribly strengthened about theknuckles by a plate of iron, and sometimes a plummet of lead.  Yet this,which was meant to increase, perhaps rather diminished, the interest ofthe fray: for it necessarily shortened its duration.  A very few blows,successfully and scientifically planted, might suffice to bring thecontest to a close; and the battle did not, therefore, often allow fullscope for the energy, fortitude and dogged perseverance, that wetechnically style pluck, which not unusually wins the day againstsuperior science, and which heightens to so painful a delight theinterest in the battle and the sympathy for the brave.\'Guard thyself!\' growled Tetraides, moving nearer and nearer to his foe,who rather shifted round him than receded.Lydon did not answer, save by a scornful glance of his quick, vigilanteye. Tetraides struck--it was as the blow of a smith on a vice; Lydonsank suddenly on one knee--the blow passed over his head.  Not soharmless was Lydon\'s retaliation: he quickly sprung to his feet, andaimed his cestus full on the broad breast of his antagonist.  Tetraidesreeled--the populace shouted.\'You are unlucky to-day,\' said Lepidus to Clodius: \'you have lost onebet----you will lose another.\'\'By the gods! my bronzes go to the auctioneer if that is the case. Ihave no less than a hundred sestertia upon Tetraides.  Ha, ha! see howhe rallies! That was a home stroke: he has cut open Lydon\'s shoulder.  ATetraides!--a Tetraides!\'\'But Lydon is not disheartened.  By Pollux! how well he keeps histemper. See how dexterously he avoids those hammer-like hands!--dodgingnow here, now there--circling round and round.  Ah, poor Lydon! he hasit again.\'\'Three to one still on Tetraides!  What say you, Lepidus?\'\'Well, nine sestertia to three--be it so!  What! again, Lydon?  Hestops--he gasps for breath.  By the gods, he is down.  No--he is againon his legs. Brave Lydon! Tetraides is encouraged--he laughs loud--herushes on him.\'\'Fool--success blinds him--he should be cautious.  Lydon\'s eye is likethe lynx\'s,\' said Clodius, between his teeth.\'Ha, Clodius! saw you that?  Your man totters!  Another blow--hefalls--he falls!\'\'Earth revives him, then.  He is once more up; but the blood rolls downhis face.\'\'By the thunderer! Lydon wins it.  See how he presses on him! That blowon the temple would have crushed an ox! it has crushed Tetraides.  Hefalls again--he cannot move--habet!--habet!\'\'Habet!\' repeated Pansa.  \'Take them out and give them the armor andswords.\'\'Noble editor,\' said the officers, \'we fear that Tetraides will notrecover in time; howbeit, we will try.\'\'Do so.\'In a few minutes the officers, who had dragged off the stunned andinsensible gladiator, returned with rueful countenances.  They fearedfor his life; he was utterly incapacitated from re-entering the arena.\'In that case,\' said Pansa, \'hold Lydon a subdititius; and the firstgladiator that is vanquished, let Lydon supply his place with thevictor.\' The people shouted their applause at this sentence: then theyagain sunk into deep silence.  The trumpet sounded loudly. The fourcombatants stood each against each in prepared and stern array.\'Dost thou recognize the Romans, my Clodius; are they among thecelebrated, or are they merely ordinary?\'\'Eumolpus is a good second-rate swordsman, my Lepidus.  Nepimus, thelesser man, I have never seen before: but he is the son of one of theimperial fiscales, and brought up in a proper school; doubtless theywill show sport, but I have no heart for the game; I cannot win back mymoney--I am undone. Curses on that Lydon! who could have supposed he wasso dexterous or so lucky?\'\'Well, Clodius, shall I take compassion on you, and accept your ownterms with these Romans?\'\'An even ten sestertia on Eumolpus, then?\'\'What! when Nepimus is untried?  Nay, nay; that is to bad.\'\'Well--ten to eight?\'\'Agreed.\'While the contest in the amphitheatre had thus commenced, there was onein the loftier benches for whom it had assumed, indeed, a poignant--astifling interest.  The aged father of Lydon, despite his Christianhorror of the spectacle, in his agonized anxiety for his son, had notbeen able to resist being the spectator of his fate. One amidst a fiercecrowd of strangers--the lowest rabble of the populace--the old man saw,felt nothing, but the form--the presence of his brave son!  Not a soundhad escaped his lips when twice he had seen him fall to the earth--onlyhe had turned paler, and his limbs trembled.  But he had uttered one lowcry when he saw him victorious; unconscious, alas! of the more fearfulbattle to which that victory was but a prelude.\'My gallant boy!\' said he, and wiped his eyes.\'Is he thy son?\' said a brawny fellow to the right of the Nazarene; \'hehas fought well: let us see how he does by-and-by.  Hark! he is to fightthe first victor.  Now, old boy, pray the gods that that victor beneither of the Romans! nor, next to them, the giant Niger.\'The old man sat down again and covered his face.  The fray for themoment was indifferent to him--Lydon was not one of the combatants.Yet--yet--the thought flashed across him--the fray was indeed of deadlyinterest--the first who fell was to make way for Lydon!  He started, andbent down, with straining eyes and clasped hands, to view the encounter.The first interest was attracted towards the combat of Niger withSporus; for this species of contest, from the fatal result which usuallyattended it, and from the great science it required in eitherantagonist, was always peculiarly inviting to the spectators.They stood at a considerable distance from each other.  The singularhelmet which Sporus wore (the vizor of which was down) concealed hisface; but the features of Niger attracted a fearful and universalinterest from their compressed and vigilant ferocity. Thus they stoodfor some moments, each eyeing each, until Sporus began slowly, and withgreat caution, to advance, holding his sword pointed, like a modernfencer\'s, at the breast of his foe. Niger retreated as his antagonistadvanced, gathering up his net with his right hand, and never taking hissmall glittering eye from the movements of the swordsman.  Suddenly whenSporus had approached nearly at arm\'s length, the retiarius threwhimself forward, and cast his net.  A quick inflection of body saved thegladiator from the deadly snare! he uttered a sharp cry of joy and rage,and rushed upon Niger: but Niger had already drawn in his net, thrown itacross his shoulders, and now fled round the lists with a swiftnesswhich the secutor in vain endeavored to equal.  The people laughed andshouted aloud, to see the ineffectual efforts of the broad-shoulderedgladiator to overtake the flying giant: when, at that moment, theirattention was turned from these to the two Roman combatants.They had placed themselves at the onset face to face, at the distance ofmodern fencers from each other: but the extreme caution which bothevinced at first had prevented any warmth of engagement, and allowed thespectators full leisure to interest themselves in the battle betweenSporus and his foe.  But the Romans were now heated into full and fierceencounter: they pushed--returned--advanced on--retreated from each otherwith all that careful yet scarcely perceptible caution whichcharacterizes men well experienced and equally matched.  But at thismoment, Eumolpus, the elder gladiator, by that dexterous back-strokewhich was considered in the arena so difficult to avoid, had woundedNepimus in the side.  The people shouted; Lepidus turned pale.\'Ho!\' said Clodius, \'the game is nearly over.  If Eumolpus fights nowthe quiet fight, the other will gradually bleed himself away.\'\'But, thank the gods! he does not fight the backward fight. See!--hepresses hard upon Nepimus.  By Mars! but Nepimus had him there! thehelmet rang again!--Clodius, I shall win!\'\'Why do I ever bet but at the dice?\' groaned Clodius to himself;--or whycannot one cog a gladiator?\'\'A Sporus!--a Sporus!\' shouted the populace, as Niger having nowsuddenly paused, had again cast his net, and again unsuccessfully. Hehad not retreated this time with sufficient agility--the sword of Sporushad inflicted a severe wound upon his right leg; and, incapacitated tofly, he was pressed hard by the fierce swordsman.  His great height andlength of arm still continued, however, to give him no despicableadvantages; and steadily keeping his trident at the front of his foe, herepelled him successfully for several minutes. Sporus now tried, bygreat rapidity of evolution, to get round his antagonist, whonecessarily moved with pain and slowness.  In so doing, he lost hiscaution--he advanced too near to the giant--raised his arm to strike,and received the three points of the fatal spear full in his breast!  Hesank on his knee.  In a moment more, the deadly net was cast over him,he struggled against its meshes in vain; again--again--again he writhedmutely beneath the fresh strokes of the trident--his blood flowed fastthrough the net and redly over the sand.  He lowered his arms inacknowledgment of defeat.The conquering retiarius withdrew his net, and leaning on his spear,looked to the audience for their judgement.  Slowly, too, at the samemoment, the vanquished gladiator rolled his dim and despairing eyesaround the theatre. From row to row, from bench to bench, there glaredupon him but merciless and unpitying eyes.Hushed was the roar--the murmur!  The silence was dread, for it was nosympathy; not a hand--no, not even a woman\'s hand--gave the signal ofcharity and life!  Sporus had never been popular in the arena; and,lately, the interest of the combat had been excited on behalf of thewounded Niger. The people were warmed into blood--the mimic fight hadceased to charm; the interest had mounted up to the desire of sacrificeand the thirst of death!The gladiator felt that his doom was sealed: he uttered no prayer--nogroan. The people gave the signal of death!  In dogged but agonizedsubmission, he bent his neck to receive the fatal stroke.  And now, asthe spear of the retiarius was not a weapon to inflict instant andcertain death, there stalked into the arena a grim and fatal form,brandishing a short, sharp sword, and with features utterly concealedbeneath its vizor.  With slow and measured steps, this dismal headsmanapproached the gladiator, still kneeling--laid the left hand on hishumbled crest--drew the edge of the blade across his neck--turned roundto the assembly, lest, in the last moment, remorse should come uponthem; the dread signal continued the same: the blade glittered brightlyin the air--fell--and the gladiator rolled upon the sand; his limbsquivered--were still--he was a corpse.\'His body was dragged at once from the arena through the gate of death,and thrown into the gloomy den termed technically the spoliarium.  Andere it had well reached that destination, the strife between theremaining combatants was decided.  The sword of Eumolpus had inflictedthe death-wound upon the less experienced combatant.  A new victim wasadded to the receptacle of the slain.Throughout that mighty assembly there now ran a universal movement; thepeople breathed more freely, and resettled themselves in their seats.  Agrateful shower was cast over every row from the concealed conduits.  Incool and luxurious pleasure they talked over the late spectacle ofblood. Eumolpus removed his helmet, and wiped his brows; hisclose-curled hair and short beard, his noble Roman features and brightdark eye attracted the general admiration.  He was fresh, unwounded,unfatigued.The editor paused, and proclaimed aloud that, as Niger\'s wound disabledhim from again entering the arena, Lydon was to be the successor to theslaughtered Nepimus, and the new combatant of Eumolpus.\'Yet, Lydon,\' added he, \'if thou wouldst decline the combat with one sobrave and tried, thou mayst have full liberty to do so. Eumolpus is notthe antagonist that was originally decreed for thee. Thou knowest besthow far thou canst cope with him.  If thou failest, thy doom ishonorable death; if thou conquerest, out of my own purse I will doublethe stipulated prize.\'The people shouted applause.  Lydon stood in the lists, he gazed around;high above he beheld the pale face, the straining eyes, of his father.He turned away irresolute for a moment.  No! the conquest of the cestuswas not sufficient--he had not yet won the prize of victory--his fatherwas still a slave!\'Noble aedile!\' he replied, in a firm and deep tone, \'I shrink not fromthis combat.  For the honour of Pompeii, I demand that one trained byits long-celebrated lanista shall do battle with this Roman.\'The people shouted louder than before.\'Four to one against Lydon!\' said Clodius to Lepidus.\'I would not take twenty to one!  Why, Eumolpus is a very Achilles, andthis poor fellow is but a tyro!\'Eumolpus gazed hard on the face of Lydon; he smiled; yet the smile wasfollowed by a slight and scarce audible sigh--a touch of compassionateemotion, which custom conquered the moment the heart acknowledged it.And now both, clad in complete armor, the sword drawn, the vizor closed,the two last combatants of the arena (ere man, at least, was matchedwith beast), stood opposed to each other.It was just at this time that a letter was delivered to the proctor byone of the attendants of the arena; he removed the cincture--glancedover it for a moment--his countenance betrayed surprise andembarrassment.  He re-read the letter, and then muttering--\'Tush! it isimpossible!--the man must be drunk, even in the morning, to dream ofsuch follies!\'--threw it carelessly aside, and gravely settled himselfonce more in the attitude of attention to the sports.The interest of the public was wound up very high.  Eumolpus had atfirst won their favor; but the gallantry of Lydon, and his well-timedallusion to the honour of the Pompeian lanista, had afterwards given thelatter the preference in their eyes.\'Holla, old fellow!\' said Medon\'s neighbor to him.  \'Your son is hardlymatched; but never fear, the editor will not permit him to be slain--no,nor the people neither; he has behaved too bravely for that.  Ha! thatwas a home thrust!--well averted, by Pollux!  At him again, Lydon!--theystop to breathe.  What art thou muttering, old boy\'Prayers!\' answered Medon, with a more calm and hopeful mien than he hadyet maintained.\'Prayers!--trifles!  The time for gods to carry a man away in a cloud isgone now.  Ha! Jupiter! what a blow!  Thy side--thy side!--take care ofthy side, Lydon!\'There was a convulsive tremor throughout the assembly.  A fierce blowfrom Eumolpus, full on the crest, had brought Lydon to his knee.\'Habet!--he has it!\' cried a shrill female voice; \'he has it!\' It wasthe voice of the girl who had so anxiously anticipated the sacrifice ofsome criminal to the beasts.\'Be silent, child!\' said the wife of Pansa, haughtily.  \'Non habet!--heis not wounded!\'\'I wish he were, if only to spite old surly Medon,\' muttered the girl.Meanwhile Lydon, who had hitherto defended himself with great skill andvalor, began to give way before the vigorous assaults of the practisedRoman; his arm grew tired, his eye dizzy, he breathed hard andpainfully. The combatants paused again for breath.\'Young man,\' said Eumolpus, in a low voice, \'desist; I will wound theeslightly--then lower thy arms; thou hast propitiated the editor and themob--thou wilt be honorably saved!\'\'And my father still enslaved!\' groaned Lydon to himself.  \'No! death orhis freedom.\'At that thought, and seeing that, his strength not being equal to theendurance of the Roman, everything depended on a sudden and desperateeffort, he threw himself fiercely on Eumolpus; the Roman warilyretreated--Lydon thrust again--Eumolpus drew himself aside--the swordgrazed his cuirass--Lydon\'s breast was exposed--the Roman plunged hissword through the joints of the armor, not meaning, however, to inflicta deep wound; Lydon, weak and exhausted, fell forward, fell right on thepoint: it passed through and through, even to the back.  Eumolpus drewforth his blade; Lydon still made an effort to regain his balance--hissword left his grasp--he struck mechanically at the gladiator with hisnaked hand, and fell prostrate on the arena.  With one accord, editorand assembly made the signal of mercy--the officers of the arenaapproached--they took off the helmet of the vanquished.  He stillbreathed; his eyes rolled fiercely on his foe; the savageness he hadacquired in his calling glared from his gaze, and lowered upon the browdarkened already with the shades of death; then, with a convulsivegroan, with a half start, he lifted his eyes above.  They rested not onthe face of the editor nor on the pitying brows of his relenting judges.He saw them not; they were as if the vast space was desolate and bare;one pale agonizing face alone was all he recognized--one cry of a brokenheart was all that, amidst the murmurs and the shouts of the populace,reached his ear.  The ferocity vanished from his brow; a soft, a tenderexpression of sanctifying but despairing love played over hisfeatures--played--waned--darkened!  His face suddenly became locked andrigid, resuming its former fierceness.  He fell upon the earth.\'Look to him,\' said the aedile; \'he has done his duty!\'The officers dragged him off to the spoliarium.\'A true type of glory, and of its fate!\' murmured Arbaces to himself,and his eye, glancing round the amphitheatre, betrayed so much ofdisdain and scorn, that whoever encountered it felt his breath suddenlyarrested, and his emotions frozen into one sensation of abasement and ofawe.Again rich perfumes were wafted around the theatre; the attendantssprinkled fresh sand over the arena.\'Bring forth the lion and Glaucus the Athenian,\' said the editor.And a deep and breathless hush of overwrought interest, and intense(yet, strange to say, not unpleasing) terror lay, like a mighty andawful dream, over the assembly.Chapter IIISALLUST AND NYDIA\'S LETTER.THRICE had Sallust awakened from his morning sleep, and thrice,recollecting that his friend was that day to perish, had he turnedhimself with a deep sigh once more to court oblivion.  His sole objectin life was to avoid pain; and where he could not avoid, at least toforget it.At length, unable any longer to steep his consciousness in slumber, heraised himself from his incumbent posture, and discovered his favoritefreedman sitting by his bedside as usual; for Sallust, who, as I havesaid, had a gentlemanlike taste for the polite letters, was accustomedto be read to for an hour or so previous to his rising in the morning.\'No books to-day! no more Tibullus! no more Pindar for me!  Pindar!alas, alas! the very name recalls those games to which our arena is thesavage successor.  Has it begun--the amphitheatre? are its ritescommenced?\'\'Long since, O Sallust!  Did you not hear the trumpets and the tramplingfeet?\'\'Ay, ay; but the gods be thanked, I was drowsy, and had only to turnround to fall asleep again.\'\'The gladiators must have been long in the ring.\'\'The wretches!  None of my people have gone to the spectacle?\'\'Assuredly not; your orders were too strict.\'\'That is well--would the day were over!  What is that letter yonder onthe table?\'\'That!  Oh, the letter brought to you last night, when youwere--too--too...\'\'Drunk to read it, I suppose.  No matter, it cannot be of muchimportance.\'\'Shall I open it for you, Sallust,\'\'Do: anything to divert my thoughts.  Poor Glaucus!\'The freedman opened the letter.  \'What! Greek?\' said he, \'some learnedlady, I suppose.\' He glanced over the letter, and for some moments theirregular lines traced by the blind girl\'s hand puzzled him.  Suddenly,however, his countenance exhibited emotion and surprise.  \'Good gods!noble Sallust! what have we done not to attend to this before?  Hear meread!\'\'""Nydia, the slave, to Sallust, the friend of Glaucus!  I am a prisonerin the house of Arbaces.  Hasten to the praetor! procure my release, andwe shall yet save Glaucus from the lion.  There is another prisonerwithin these walls, whose witness can exonerate the Athenian from thecharge against him--one who saw the crime--who can prove the criminal ina villain hitherto unsuspected.  Fly! hasten! quick! quick!  Bring withyou armed men, lest resistance be made, and a cunning and dexteroussmith; for the dungeon of my fellow-prisoner is thick and strong.  Oh!by thy right hand and thy father\'s ashes, lose not a moment!""\'\'Great Jove!\' exclaimed Sallust, starting, \'and this day--nay, withinthis hour, perhaps, he dies.  What is to be done?  I will instantly tothe praetor.\'\'Nay; not so.  The praetor (as well as Pansa, the editor himself) is thecreature of the mob; and the mob will not hear of delay; they will notbe balked in the very moment of expectation.  Besides, the publicity ofthe appeal would forewarn the cunning Egyptian.  It is evident that hehas some interest in these concealments.  No; fortunately thy slaves arein thy house.\'\'I seize thy meaning,\' interrupted Sallust: \'arm the slaves instantly.The streets are empty.  We will ourselves hasten to the house ofArbaces, and release the prisoners.  Quick! quick!  What ho! Davusthere!  My gown and sandals, the papyrus and a reed.\' I will write tothe praetor, to beseech him to delay the sentence of Glaucus, for that,within an hour, we may yet prove him innocent.  So, so, that is well.Hasten with this, Davus, to the praetor, at the amphitheatre.  See itgiven to his own hand.  Now then, O ye gods! whose providence Epicurusdenied, befriend me, and I will call Epicurus a liar!\'Chapter IVTHE AMPHITHEATRE ONCE MORE.GLAUCUS and Olinthus had been placed together in that gloomy and narrowcell in which the criminals of the arena awaited their last and fearfulstruggle. Their eyes, of late accustomed to the darkness, scanned thefaces of each other in this awful hour, and by that dim light, thepaleness, which chased away the natural hues from either cheek, assumeda yet more ashy and ghastly whiteness.  Yet their brows were erect anddauntless--their limbs did not tremble--their lips were compressed andrigid.  The religion of the one, the pride of the other, the consciousinnocence of both, and, it may be, the support derived from their mutualcompanionship, elevated the victim into the hero.\'Hark! hearest thou that shout They are growling over their humanblood,\' said Olinthus.\'I hear; my heart grows sick; but the gods support me.\'\'The gods!  O rash young man!  in this hour recognize only the One God.Have I not taught thee in the dungeon, wept for thee, prayed forthee?--in my zeal and in my agony, have I not thought more of thysalvation than my own?\'\'Brave friend!\' answered Glaucus, solemnly, \'I have listened to theewith awe, with wonder, and with a secret tendency towards conviction.Had our lives been spared, I might gradually have weaned myself from thetenets of my own faith, and inclined to thine; but, in this last hour itwere a craven thing, and a base, to yield to hasty terror what shouldonly be the result of lengthened meditation.  Were I to embrace thycreed, and cast down my father\'s gods, should I not be bribed by thypromise of heaven, or awed by thy threats of hell? Olinthus, no!  Thinkwe of each other with equal charity--I honoring thy sincerity--thoupitying my blindness or my obdurate courage.  As have been my deeds,such will be my reward; and the Power or Powers above will not judgeharshly of human error, when it is linked with honesty of purpose andtruth of heart.  Speak we no more of this.  Hush! Dost thou hear themdrag yon heavy body through the passage?  Such as that clay will be ourssoon.\'\'O Heaven!  O Christ! already I behold ye!\' cried the fervent Olinthus,lifting up his hands; \'I tremble not--I rejoice that the prison-houseshall be soon broken.\'Glaucus bowed his head in silence.  He felt the distinction between hisfortitude and that of his fellow-sufferer.  The heathen did not tremble;but the Christian exulted.The door swung gratingly back--the gleam of spears shot along the walls.\'Glaucus the Athenian, thy time has come,\' said a loud and clear voice;\'the lion awaits thee.\'\'I am ready,\' said the Athenian.  \'Brother and co-mate, one lastembrace! Bless me--and farewell!\'The Christian opened his arms--he clasped the young heathen to hisbreast--he kissed his forehead and cheek--he sobbed aloud--his tearsflowed fast and hot over the features of his new friend.\'Oh! could I have converted thee, I had not wept.  Oh! that I might sayto thee, ""We two shall sup this night in Paradise!""\'\'It may be so yet,\' answered the Greek, with a tremulous voice. \'Theywhom death part not, may meet yet beyond the grave: on the earth--on thebeautiful, the beloved earth, farewell for ever!--Worthy officer, Iattend you.\'Glaucus tore himself away; and when he came forth into the air, itsbreath, which, though sunless, was hot and arid, smote witheringly uponhim.  His frame, not yet restored from the effects of the deadlydraught, shrank and trembled.  The officers supported him.\'Courage!\' said one; \'thou art young, active, well knit.  They give theea weapon! despair not, and thou mayst yet conquer.\'Glaucus did not reply; but, ashamed of his infirmity, he made adesperate and convulsive effort, and regained the firmness of hisnerves.  They anointed his body, completely naked, save by a cinctureround the loins, placed the stilus (vain weapon!) in his hand, and ledhim into the arena.And now when the Greek saw the eyes of thousands and tens of thousandsupon him, he no longer felt that he was mortal.  All evidence offear--all fear itself--was gone.  A red and haughty flush spread overthe paleness of his features--he towered aloft to the full of hisglorious stature.  In the elastic beauty of his limbs and form, in hisintent but unfrowning brow, in the high disdain, and in the indomitablesoul, which breathed visibly, which spoke audibly, from his attitude,his lip, his eye--he seemed the very incarnation, vivid and corporeal,of the valor of his land--of the divinity of its worship--at once a heroand a god!The murmur of hatred and horror at his crime, which had greeted hisentrance, died into the silence of involuntary admiration andhalf-compassionate respect; and with a quick and convulsive sigh, thatseemed to move the whole mass of life as if it were one body, the gazeof the spectators turned from the Athenian to a dark uncouth object inthe centre of the arena.  It was the grated den of the lion!\'By Venus, how warm it is!\' said Fulvia; \'yet there is no sun. Wouldthat those stupid sailors could have fastened up that gap in theawning!\'\'Oh! it is warm, indeed.  I turn sick--I faint!\' said the wife of Pansa;even her experienced stoicism giving way at the struggle about to takeplace.The lion had been kept without food for twenty-four hours, and theanimal had, during the whole morning, testified a singular and restlessuneasiness, which the keeper had attributed to the pangs of hunger.  Yetits bearing seemed rather that of fear than of rage; its roar waspainful and distressed; it hung its head--snuffed the air through thebars--then lay down--started again--and again uttered its wild andfar-resounding cries. And now, in its den, it lay utterly dumb and mute,with distended nostrils forced hard against the grating, and disturbingwith a heaving breath, the sand below on the arena.The editor\'s lip quivered, and his cheek grew pale; he looked anxiouslyaround--hesitated--delayed; the crowd became impatient. Slowly he gavethe sign; the keeper, who was behind the den, cautiously removed thegrating, and the lion leaped forth with a mighty and glad roar ofrelease.  The keeper hastily retreated through the grated passageleading from the arena, and left the lord of the forest--and his prey.Glaucus had bent his limbs so as to give himself the firmest posture atthe expected rush of the lion, with his small and shining weapon raisedon high, in the faint hope that one well-directed thrust (for he knewthat he should have time but for one) might penetrate through the eye tothe brain of his grim foe.But, to the unutterable astonishment of all, the beast seemed not evenaware of the presence of the criminal.At the first moment of its release it halted abruptly in the arena,raised itself half on end, snuffing the upward air with impatient sighs;then suddenly it sprang forward, but not on the Athenian.  At half-speedit circled round and round the space, turning its vast head from side toside with an anxious and perturbed gaze, as if seeking only some avenueof escape; once or twice it endeavored to leap up the parapet thatdivided it from the audience, and, on failing, uttered rather a baffledhowl than its deep-toned and kingly roar.  It evinced no sign, either ofwrath or hunger; its tail drooped along the sand, instead of lashing itsgaunt sides; and its eye, though it wandered at times to Glaucus, rolledagain listlessly from him.  At length, as if tired of attempting toescape, it crept with a moan into its cage, and once more laid itselfdown to rest.The first surprise of the assembly at the apathy of the lion soon grewconverted into resentment at its cowardice; and the populace alreadymerged their pity for the fate of Glaucus into angry compassion fortheir own disappointment.The editor called to the keeper.\'How is this?  Take the goad, prick him forth, and then close the doorof the den.\'As the keeper, with some fear, but more astonishment, was preparing toobey, a loud cry was heard at one of the entrances of the arena; therewas a confusion, a bustle--voices of remonstrance suddenly breakingforth, and suddenly silenced at the reply.  All eyes turned in wonder atthe interruption, towards the quarter of the disturbance; the crowd gaveway, and suddenly Sallust appeared on the senatorial benches, his hairdisheveled--breathless--heated--half-exhausted.  He cast his eyeshastily round the ring.  \'Remove the Athenian,\' he cried; \'haste--he isinnocent! Arrest Arbaces the Egyptian--HE is the murderer of Apaecides!\'\'Art thou mad, O Sallust!\' said the praetor, rising from his seat. \'Whatmeans this raving?\'\'Remove the Athenian!--Quick! or his blood be on your head. Praetor,delay, and you answer with your own life to the emperor!  I bring withme the eye-witness to the death of the priest Apaecides. Roomthere!--stand back!--give way!  People of Pompeii, fix every eye uponArbaces--there he sits!  Room there for the priest Calenus!\'Pale, haggard, fresh from the jaws of famine and of death, his facefallen, his eyes dull as a vulture\'s, his broad frame gaunt as askeleton--Calenus was supported into the very row in which Arbaces sat.His releasers had given him sparingly of food; but the chief sustenancethat nerved his feeble limbs was revenge!\'The priest Calenus!--Calenus!\' cried the mob.  \'Is it he?  No--it is adead man?\'\'It is the priest Calenus,\' said the praetor, gravely.  \'What hast thouto say?\'\'Arbaces of Egypt is the murderer of Apaecides, the priest of Isis;these eyes saw him deal the blow.  It is from the dungeon into which heplunged me--it is from the darkness and horror of a death byfamine--that the gods have raised me to proclaim his crime!  Release theAthenian--he is innocent!\'\'It is for this, then, that the lion spared him.  A miracle! a miracle!\'cried Pansa.\'A miracle; a miracle!\' shouted the people; \'remove theAthenian--Arbaces to the lion!\'And that shout echoed from hill to vale--from coast to sea--\'Arbaces tothe lion!\'Officers, remove the accused Glaucus--remove, but guard him yet,\' saidthe praetor.  \'The gods lavish their wonders upon this day.\'As the praetor gave the word of release, there was a cry of joy--afemale voice--a child\'s voice--and it was of joy!  It rang through theheart of the assembly with electric force--it, was touching, it washoly, that child\'s voice!  And the populace echoed it back withsympathizing congratulation!\'Silence!\' said the grave praetor--\'who is there?\'\'The blind girl--Nydia,\' answered Sallust; \'it is her hand that hasraised Calenus from the grave, and delivered Glaucus from the lion.\'\'Of this hereafter,\' said the praetor.  \'Calenus, priest of Isis, thouaccusest Arbaces of the murder of Apaecides?\'\'I do.\'\'Thou didst behold the deed?\'\'Praetor--with these eyes...\'\'Enough at present--the details must be reserved for more suiting timeand place.  Arbaces of Egypt, thou hearest the charge against thee--thouhast not yet spoken--what hast thou to say.The gaze of the crowd had been long riveted on Arbaces: but not untilthe confusion which he had betrayed at the first charge of Sallust andthe entrance of Calenus had subsided.  At the shout, \'Arbaces to thelion!\' he had indeed trembled, and the dark bronze of his cheek hadtaken a paler hue. But he had soon recovered his haughtiness andself-control.  Proudly he returned the angry glare of the countless eyesaround him; and replying now to the question of the praetor, he said, inthat accent so peculiarly tranquil and commanding, which characterizedhis tones:\'Praetor, this charge is so mad that it scarcely deserves reply. Myfirst accuser is the noble Sallust--the most intimate friend of Glaucus!my second is a priest; I revere his garb and calling--but, people ofPompeii! ye know somewhat of the character of Calenus--he is griping andgold-thirsty to a proverb; the witness of such men is to be bought!Praetor, I am innocent!\'\'Sallust,\' said the magistrate, \'where found you Calenus?\'\'In the dungeons of Arbaces.\'\'Egyptian,\' said the praetor, frowning, \'thou didst, then, dare toimprison a priest of the gods--and wherefore?\'\'Hear me,\' answered Arbaces, rising calmly, but with agitation visiblein his face.  \'This man came to threaten that he would make against methe charge he has now made, unless I would purchase his silence withhalf my fortune: I remonstrated--in vain.  Peace there--let not thepriest interrupt me!  Noble praetor--and ye, O people!  I was a strangerin the land--I knew myself innocent of crime--but the witness of apriest against me might yet destroy me.  In my perplexity I decoyed himto the cell whence he has been released, on pretence that it was thecoffer-house of my gold.  I resolved to detain him there until the fateof the true criminal was sealed, and his threats could avail no longer;but I meant no worse.  I may have erred--but who amongst ye will notacknowledge the equity of self-preservation?  Were I guilty, why was thewitness of this priest silent at the trial?--then I had not detained orconcealed him.  Why did he not proclaim my guilt when I proclaimed thatof Glaucus? Praetor, this needs an answer.  For the rest, I throw myselfon your laws.  I demand their protection.  Remove hence the accused andthe accuser.  I will willingly meet, and cheerfully abide by, thedecision of the legitimate tribunal.  This is no place for furtherparley.\'\'He says right,\' said the praetor.  \'Ho! guards--remove Arbaces--guardCalenus!  Sallust, we hold you responsible for your accusation. Let thesports be resumed.\'\'What!\' cried Calenus, turning round to the people, \'shall Isis be thuscontemned?  Shall the blood of Apaecides yet cry for vengeance? Shalljustice be delayed now, that it may be frustrated hereafter? Shall thelion be cheated of his lawful prey?  A god! a god!--I feel the god rushto my lips!  To the lion--to the lion with Arbaces!\'His exhausted frame could support no longer the ferocious malice of thepriest; he sank on the ground in strong convulsions--the foam gatheredto his mouth--he was as a man, indeed, whom a supernatural power hadentered! The people saw and shuddered.\'It is a god that inspires the holy man!  To the lion with theEgyptian!\'With that cry up sprang--on moved--thousands upon thousands! They rushedfrom the heights--they poured down in the direction of the Egyptian.  Invain did the aedile command--in vain did the praetor lift his voice andproclaim the law.  The people had been already rendered savage by theexhibition of blood--they thirsted for more--their superstition wasaided by their ferocity.  Aroused--inflamed by the spectacle of theirvictims, they forgot the authority of their rulers.  It was one of thosedread popular convulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant, half freeand half servile; and which the peculiar constitution of the Romanprovinces so frequently exhibited.  The power of the praetor was as areed beneath the whirlwind; still, at his word the guards had drawnthemselves along the lower benches, on which the upper classes satseparate from the vulgar.  They made but a feeble barrier--the waves ofthe human sea halted for a moment, to enable Arbaces to count the exactmoment of his doom!  In despair, and in a terror which beat down evenpride, he glanced his eyes over the rolling and rushing crowd--when,right above them, through the wide chasm which had been left in thevelaria, he beheld a strange and awful apparition--he beheld--and hiscraft restored his courage!He stretched his hand on high; over his lofty brow and royal featuresthere came an expression of unutterable solemnity and command.\'Behold!\' he shouted with a voice of thunder, which stilled the roar ofthe crowd; \'behold how the gods protect the guiltless!  The fires of theavenging Orcus burst forth against the false witness of my accusers!\'The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian, and beheld,with ineffable dismay, a vast vapor shooting from the summit ofVesuvius, in the form of a gigantic pine-tree; the trunk, blackness--thebranches, fire!--a fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with everymoment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red, that againblazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare!There was a dead, heart-sunken silence--through which there suddenlybroke the roar of the lion, which was echoed back from within thebuilding by the sharper and fiercer yells of its fellow-beast. Dreadseers were they of the Burden of the Atmosphere, and wild prophets ofthe wrath to come!Then there arose on high the universal shrieks of women; the men staredat each other, but were dumb.  At that moment they felt the earth shakebeneath their feet; the walls of the theatre trembled: and, beyond inthe distance, they heard the crash of falling roofs; an instant more andthe mountain-cloud seemed to roll towards them, dark and rapid, like atorrent; at the same time, it cast forth from its bosom a shower ofashes mixed with vast fragments of burning stone!  Over the crushingvines--over the desolate streets--over the amphitheatre itself--far andwide--with many a mighty splash in the agitated sea--fell that awfulshower!No longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces; safety forthemselves was their sole thought.  Each turned to fly--each dashing,pressing, crushing, against the other.  Trampling recklessly over thefallen--amidst groans, and oaths, and prayers, and sudden shrieks, theenormous crowd vomited itself forth through the numerous passages.Whither should they fly? Some, anticipating a second earthquake,hastened to their homes to load themselves with their more costly goods,and escape while it was yet time; others, dreading the showers of ashesthat now fell fast, torrent upon torrent, over the streets, rushed underthe roofs of the nearest houses, or temples, or sheds--shelter of anykind--for protection from the terrors of the open air.  But darker, andlarger, and mightier, spread the cloud above them.  It was a sudden andmore ghastly Night rushing upon the realm of Noon!Chapter VTHE CELL OF THE PRISONER AND THE DEN OF THE DEAD.  GRIEF UNCONSCIOUS OFHORROR.STUNNED by his reprieve, doubting that he was awake, Glaucus had beenled by the officers of the arena into a small cell within the walls ofthe theatre. They threw a loose robe over his form, and crowded round incongratulation and wonder.  There was an impatient and fretful crywithout the cell; the throng gave way, and the blind girl, led by somegentler hand, flung herself at the feet of Glaucus.\'It is I who have saved thee,\' she sobbed; \'now let me die!\'\'Nydia, my child!--my preserver!\'\'Oh, let me feel thy touch--thy breath!  Yes, yes, thou livest! We arenot too late!  That dread door, methought it would never yield! andCalenus--oh! his voice was as the dying wind among tombs--we had towait--gods! it seemed hours ere food and wine restored to him somethingof strength.  But thou livest! thou livest yet! And I--I have savedthee!\'This affecting scene was soon interrupted by the event just described.\'The mountain! the earthquake!\' resounded from side to side.  Theofficers fled with the rest; they left Glaucus and Nydia to savethemselves as they might.As the sense of the dangers around them flashed on the Athenian, hisgenerous heart recurred to Olinthus.  He, too, was reprieved from thetiger by the hand of the gods; should he be left to a no less fataldeath in the neighboring cell?  Taking Nydia by the hand, Glaucushurried across the passages; he gained the den of the Christian!  Hefound Olinthus kneeling and in prayer.\'Arise! arise! my friend,\' he cried.  \'Save thyself, and fly! See!Nature is thy dread deliverer!\' He led forth the bewildered Christian,and pointed to a cloud which advanced darker and darker, disgorgingforth showers of ashes and pumice stones--and bade him hearken to thecries and trampling rush of the scattered crowd.\'This is the hand of God--God be praised!\' said Olinthus, devoutly.\'Fly! seek thy brethren!--Concert with them thy escape.  Farewell!\'Olinthus did not answer, neither did he mark the retreating form of hisfriend.  High thoughts and solemn absorbed his soul: and in theenthusiasm of his kindling heart, he exulted in the mercy of God ratherthan trembled at the evidence of His power.At length he roused himself, and hurried on, he scarce knew whither.The open doors of a dark, desolate cell suddenly appeared on his path;through the gloom within there flared and flickered a single lamp; andby its light he saw three grim and naked forms stretched on the earth indeath. His feet were suddenly arrested; for, amidst the terror of thatdrear recess--the spoliarium of the arena--he heard a low voice callingon the name of Christ!He could not resist lingering at that appeal: he entered the den, andhis feet were dabbled in the slow streams of blood that gushed from thecorpses over the sand.\'Who,\' said the Nazarene, \'calls upon the son of God?\'No answer came forth; and turning round, Olinthus beheld, by the lightof the lamp, an old grey-headed man sitting on the floor, and supportingin his lap the head of one of the dead.  The features of the dead manwere firmly and rigidly locked in the last sleep; but over the lip thereplayed a fierce smile--not the Christian\'s smile of hope, but the darksneer of hatred and defiance.  Yet on the face still lingered thebeautiful roundness of early youth.  The hair curled thick and glossyover the unwrinkled brow; and the down of manhood but slightly shadedthe marble of the hueless cheek.  And over this face bent one of suchunutterable sadness--of such yearning tenderness--of such fond and suchdeep despair!  The tears of the old man fell fast and hot, but he didnot feel them; and when his lips moved, and he mechanically uttered theprayer of his benign and hopeful faith, neither his heart nor his senseresponded to the words: it was but the involuntary emotion that brokefrom the lethargy of his mind.  His boy was dead, and had died forhim!--and the old man\'s heart was broken!\'Medon!\' said Olinthus, pityingly, \'arise, and fly!  God is forth uponthe wings of the elements!  The New Gomorrah is doomed!--Fly, ere thefires consume thee!\'\'He was ever so full of life!--he cannot be dead!  Come hither!--placeyour hand on his heart!--sure it beats yet?\'\'Brother, the soul has fled!  We will remember it in our prayers! Thoucanst not reanimate the dumb clay!  Come, come--hark! while I speak, yoncrashing walls!--hark! yon agonizing cries!  Not a moment is to belost!--Come!\'\'I hear nothing!\' said Medon, shaking his grey hair.  \'The poor boy, hislove murdered him!\'\'Come! come! forgive this friendly force.\'\'What!  Who could sever the father from the son?\' And Medon clasped thebody tightly in his embrace, and covered it with passionate kisses.\'Go!\' said he, lifting up his face for one moment.  \'Go!--we must bealone!\'\'Alas!\' said the compassionate Nazarene, \'Death hath severed yealready!\'The old man smiled very calmly.  \'No, no, no!\' muttered, his voicegrowing lower with each word--\'Death has been more kind!\'With that his head drooped on His son\'s breast--his arms relaxed theirgrasp.  Olinthus caught him by the hand--the pulse had ceased to beat!The last words of the father were the words of truth--Death had beenmore kind!Meanwhile Glaucus and Nydia were pacing swiftly up the perilous andfearful streets.  The Athenian had learned from his preserver that Ionewas yet in the house of Arbaces.  Thither he fled, to release--to saveher!  The few slaves whom the Egyptian had left at his mansion when hehad repaired in long procession to the amphitheatre, had been able tooffer no resistance to the armed band of Sallust; and when afterwardsthe volcano broke forth, they had huddled together, stunned andfrightened, in the inmost recesses of the house.  Even the tallEthiopian had forsaken his post at the door; and Glaucus (who left Nydiawithout--the poor Nydia, jealous once more, even in such an hour!)passed on through the vast hall without meeting one from whom to learnthe chamber of Ione.  Even as he passed, however, the darkness thatcovered the heavens increased so rapidly that it was with difficulty hecould guide his steps.  The flower-wreathed columns seemed to reel andtremble; and with every instant he heard the ashes fall cranchingly intothe roofless peristyle.  He ascended to the upper rooms--breathless hepaced along, shouting out aloud the name of Ione; and at length heheard, at the end of a gallery, a voice--her voice, in wondering reply!To rush forward--to shatter the door--to seize Ione in his arms--tohurry from the mansion--seemed to him the work of an instant!  Scarcehad he gained the spot where Nydia was, than he heard steps advancingtowards the house, and recognized the voice of Arbaces, who had returnedto seek his wealth and Ione ere he fled from the doomed Pompeii.  But sodense was already the reeking atmosphere, that the foes saw not eachother, though so near--save that, dimly in the gloom, Glaucus caught themoving outline of the snowy robes of the Egyptian.They hastened onward--those three.  Alas! whither?  They now saw not astep before them--the blackness became utter.  They were encompassedwith doubt and horror!--and the death he had escaped seemed to Glaucusonly to have changed its form and augmented its victims.Chapter VICALENUS AND BURBO.  DIOMED AND CLODIUS.  THE GIRL OF THE AMPHITHEATREAND JULIA.THE sudden catastrophe which had, as it were, riven the very bonds ofsociety, and left prisoner and jailer alike free, had soon rid Calenusof the guards to whose care the praetor had consigned him.  And when thedarkness and the crowd separated the priest from his attendants, hehastened with trembling steps towards the temple of his goddess.  As hecrept along, and ere the darkness was complete, he felt himself suddenlycaught by the robe, and a voice muttered in his ear:\'Hist!--Calenus!--an awful hour!\'\'Ay! by my father\'s head!  Who art thou?--thy face is dim, and thy voiceis strange.\'Not know thy Burbo?--fie!\'\'Gods!--how the darkness gathers!  Ho, ho!--by yon terrific mountain,what sudden blazes of lightning!\'--How they dart and quiver! Hades isloosed on earth!\'\'Tush!--thou believest not these things, Calenus!  Now is the time tomake our fortune!\'\'Ha!\'\'Listen! Thy temple is full of gold and precious mummeries!--let us loadourselves with them, and then hasten to the sea and embark! None willever ask an account of the doings of this day.\'\'Burbo, thou art right!  Hush, and follow me into the temple.  Who caresnow--who sees now--whether thou art a priest or not?  Follow, and wewill share.\'In the precincts of the temple were many priests gathered around thealtars, praying, weeping, grovelling in the dust.  Impostors in safety,they were not the less superstitious in danger!  Calenus passed them,and entered the chamber yet to be seen in the south side of the court.Burbo followed him--the priest struck a light.  Wine and viands strewedthe table; the remains of a sacrificial feast.\'A man who has hungered forty-eight hours,\' muttered Calenus, \'has anappetite even in such a time.\' He seized on the food, and devoured itgreedily.  Nothing could perhaps, be more unnaturally horrid than theselfish baseness of these villains; for there is nothing more loathsomethan the valor of avarice.  Plunder and sacrilege while the pillars ofthe world tottered to and fro!  What an increase to the terrors ofnature can be made by the vices of man!\'Wilt thou never have done?\' said Burbo, impatiently; \'thy face purplesand thine eyes start already.\'\'It is not every day one has such a right to be hungry.  Oh, Jupiter!what sound is that?--the hissing of fiery water!  What! does the cloudgive rain as well as flame!  Ha!--what! shrieks?  And, Burbo, how silentall is now! Look forth!\'Amidst the other horrors, the mighty mountain now cast up columns ofboiling water.  Blent and kneaded with the half-burning ashes, thestreams fell like seething mud over the streets in frequent intervals.And full, where the priests of Isis had now cowered around the altars,on which they had vainly sought to kindle fires and pour incense, one ofthe fiercest of those deadly torrents, mingled with immense fragments ofscoria, had poured its rage. Over the bended forms of the priests itdashed: that cry had been of death--that silence had been of eternity!The ashes--the pitchy streams--sprinkled the altars, covered thepavement, and half concealed the quivering corpses of the priests!\'They are dead,\' said Burbo, terrified for the first time, and hurryingback into the cell.  \'I thought not the danger was so near and fatal.\'The two wretches stood staring at each other--you might have heard theirhearts beat!  Calenus, the less bold by nature, but the more griping,recovered first.\'We must to our task, and away!\' he said, in a low whisper, frightenedat his own voice.  He stepped to the threshold, paused, crossed over theheated floor and his dead brethren to the sacred chapel, and called toBurbo to follow.  But the gladiator quaked, and drew back.\'So much the better,\' thought Calenus; \'the more will be my booty.\'Hastily he loaded himself with the more portable treasures of thetemple; and thinking no more of his comrade, hurried from the sacredplace.  A sudden flash of lightning from the mount showed to Burbo, whostood motionless at the threshold, the flying and laden form of thepriest.  He took heart; he stepped forth to join him, when a tremendousshower of ashes fell right before his feet.  The gladiator shrank backonce more.  Darkness closed him in.  But the shower continuedfast--fast; its heaps rose high and suffocatingly--deathly vaporssteamed from them.  The wretch gasped for breath--he sought in despairagain to fly--the ashes had blocked up the threshold--he shrieked as hisfeet shrank from the boiling fluid. How could he escape? he could notclimb to the open space; nay, were he able, he could not brave itshorrors.  It were best to remain in the cells, protected, at least, fromthe fatal air. He sat down and clenched his teeth.  By degrees, theatmosphere from without--stifling and venomous--crept into the chamber.He could endure it no longer.  His eyes, glaring round, rested on asacrificial axe, which some priest had left in the chamber: he seizedit. With the desperate strength of his gigantic arm, he attempted to hewhis way through the walls.Meanwhile, the streets were already thinned; the crowd had hastened todisperse itself under shelter; the ashes began to fill up the lowerparts of the town; but, here and there, you heard the steps of fugitivescranching them warily, or saw their pale and haggard faces by the blueglare of the lightning, or the more unsteady glare of torches, by whichthey endeavored to steer their steps. But ever and anon, the boilingwater, or the straggling ashes, mysterious and gusty winds, rising anddying in a breath, extinguished these wandering lights, and with themthe last living hope of those who bore them.In the street that leads to the gate of Herculaneum, Clodius now benthis perplexed and doubtful way.  \'If I can gain the open country,\'thought he, \'doubtless there will be various vehicles beyond the gate,and Herculaneum is not far distant.  Thank Mercury!  I have little tolose, and that little is about me!\'\'Holla!--help there--help!\' cried a querulous and frightened voice.  \'Ihave fallen down--my torch has gone out--my slaves have deserted me.  Iam Diomed--the rich Diomed--ten thousand sesterces to him who helps me!\'At the same moment, Clodius felt himself caught by the feet. \'Illfortune to thee--let me go, fool,\' said the gambler.\'Oh, help me up!--give me thy hand!\'\'There--rise!\'\'Is this Clodius?  I know the voice!  Whither fliest thou?\'\'Towards Herculaneum.\'\'Blessed be the gods! our way is the same, then, as far as the gate.Why not take refuge in my villa?  Thou knowest the long range ofsubterranean cellars beneath the basement--that shelter, what shower canpenetrate?\'\'You speak well,\' said Clodius musingly.  \'And by storing the cellarwith food, we can remain there even some days, should these wondrousstorms endure so long.\'\'Oh, blessed be he who invented gates to a city!\' cried Diomed.\'See!--they have placed a light within yon arch: by that let us guideour steps.\'The air was now still for a few minutes: the lamp from the gate streamedout far and clear: the fugitives hurried on--they gained the gate--theypassed by the Roman sentry; the lightning flashed over his livid faceand polished helmet, but his stern features were composed even in theirawe!  He remained erect and motionless at his post.  That hour itselfhad not animated the machine of the ruthless majesty of Rome into thereasoning and self-acting man.  There he stood, amidst the crashingelements: he had not received the permission to desert his station andescape.Diomed and his companion hurried on, when suddenly a female form rushedathwart their way.  It was the girl whose ominous voice had been raisedso often and so gladly in anticipation of \'the merry show\'.\'Oh, Diomed!\' she cried, \'shelter! shelter!  See\'--pointing to an infantclasped to her breast--\'see this little one!--it is mine!--the child ofshame!  I have never owned it till this hour.  But now I remember I am amother!  I have plucked it from the cradle of its nurse: she had fled!Who could think of the babe in such an hour, but she who bore it?  Saveit! save it!\'\'Curses on thy shrill voice!  Away, harlot!\' muttered Clodius betweenhis ground teeth.\'Nay, girl,\' said the more humane Diomed; \'follow if thou wilt. Thisway--this way--to the vaults!\'They hurried on--they arrived at the house of Diomed--they laughed aloudas they crossed the threshold, for they deemed the danger over.Diomed ordered his slaves to carry down into the subterranean gallery,before described, a profusion of food and oil for lights; and thereJulia, Clodius, the mother and her babe, the greater part of the slaves,and some frightened visitors and clients of the neighborhood, soughttheir shelter.Chapter VIITHE PROGRESS OF THE DESTRUCTION.THE cloud, which had scattered so deep a murkiness over the day, had nowsettled into a solid and impenetrable mass.  It resembled less even thethickest gloom of a night in the open air than the close and blinddarkness of some narrow room.  But in proportion as the blacknessgathered, did the lightnings around Vesuvius increase in their vivid andscorching glare.  Nor was their horrible beauty confined to the usualhues of fire; no rainbow ever rivalled their varying and prodigal dyes.Now brightly blue as the most azure depth of a southern sky--now of alivid and snakelike green, darting restlessly to and fro as the folds ofan enormous serpent--now of a lurid and intolerable crimson, gushingforth through the columns of smoke, far and wide, and lighting up thewhole city from arch to arch--then suddenly dying into a sicklypaleness, like the ghost of their own life!In the pauses of the showers, you heard the rumbling of the earthbeneath, and the groaning waves of the tortured sea; or, lower still,and audible but to the watch of intensest fear, the grinding and hissingmurmur of the escaping gases through the chasms of the distant mountain.Sometimes the cloud appeared to break from its solid mass, and, by thelightning, to assume quaint and vast mimicries of human or of monstershapes, striding across the gloom, hurtling one upon the other, andvanishing swiftly into the turbulent abyss of shade; so that, to theeyes and fancies of the affrighted wanderers, the unsubstantial vaporswere as the bodily forms of gigantic foes--the agents of terror and ofdeath.The ashes in many places were already knee-deep; and the boiling showerswhich came from the steaming breath of the volcano forced their way intothe houses, bearing with them a strong and suffocating vapor.  In someplaces, immense fragments of rock, hurled upon the house roofs, boredown along the streets masses of confused ruin, which yet more and more,with every hour, obstructed the way; and, as the day advanced, themotion of the earth was more sensibly felt--the footing seemed to slideand creep--nor could chariot or litter be kept steady, even on the mostlevel ground.Sometimes the huger stones striking against each other as they fell,broke into countless fragments, emitting sparks of fire, which caughtwhatever was combustible within their reach; and along the plains beyondthe city the darkness was now terribly relieved; for several houses, andeven vineyards, had been set on flames; and at various intervals thefires rose suddenly and fiercely against the solid gloom.  To add tothis partial relief of the darkness, the citizens had, here and there,in the more public places, such as the porticoes of temples and theentrances to the forum, endeavored to place rows of torches; but theserarely continued long; the showers and the winds extinguished them, andthe sudden darkness into which their sudden birth was converted hadsomething in it doubly terrible and doubly impressing on the impotenceof human hopes, the lesson of despair.Frequently, by the momentary light of these torches, parties offugitives encountered each other, some hurrying towards the sea, othersflying from the sea back to the land; for the ocean had retreatedrapidly from the shore--an utter darkness lay over it, and upon itsgroaning and tossing waves the storm of cinders and rock fell withoutthe protection which the streets and roofs afforded to the land.Wild--haggard--ghastly with supernatural fears, these groups encounteredeach other, but without the leisure to speak, to consult, to advise; forthe showers fell now frequently, though not continuously, extinguishingthe lights, which showed to each band the deathlike faces of the other,and hurrying all to seek refuge beneath the nearest shelter.  The wholeelements of civilization were broken up.  Ever and anon, by theflickering lights, you saw the thief hastening by the most solemnauthorities of the law, laden with, and fearfully chuckling over, theproduce of his sudden gains.  If, in the darkness, wife was separatedfrom husband, or parent from child, vain was the hope of reunion.  Eachhurried blindly and confusedly on.  Nothing in all the various andcomplicated machinery of social life was left save the primal law ofself-preservation!Through this awful scene did the Athenian wade his way, accompanied byIone and the blind girl.  Suddenly, a rush of hundreds, in their path tothe sea, swept by them.  Nydia was torn from the side of Glaucus, who,with Ione, was borne rapidly onward; and when the crowd (whose formsthey saw not, so thick was the gloom) were gone, Nydia was stillseparated from their side. Glaucus shouted her name.  No answer came.They retraced their steps--in vain: they could not discover her--it wasevident she had been swept along some opposite direction by the humancurrent.  Their friend, their preserver, was lost!  And hitherto Nydiahad been their guide.  Her blindness rendered the scene familiar to heralone.  Accustomed, through a perpetual night, to thread the windings ofthe city, she had led them unerringly towards the sea-shore, by whichthey had resolved to hazard an escape.  Now, which way could they wend?all was rayless to them--a maze without a clue.  Wearied, despondent,bewildered, they, however, passed along, the ashes falling upon theirheads, the fragmentary stones dashing up in sparkles before their feet.\'Alas! alas!\' murmured Ione, \'I can go no farther; my steps sink amongthe scorching cinders.  Fly, dearest!--beloved, fly! and leave me to myfate!\'\'Hush, my betrothed! my bride!  Death with thee is sweeter than lifewithout thee!  Yet, whither--oh! whither, can we direct ourselvesthrough the gloom? Already it seems that we have made but a circle, andare in the very spot which we quitted an hour ago.\'\'O gods! yon rock--see, it hath riven the roof before us!  It is deathto move through the streets!\'\'Blessed lightning!  See, Ione--see! the portico of the Temple ofFortune is before us.  Let us creep beneath it; it will protect us fromthe showers.\'He caught his beloved in his arms, and with difficulty and labor gainedthe temple.  He bore her to the remoter and more sheltered part of theportico, and leaned over her, that he might shield her, with his ownform, from the lightning and the showers!  The beauty and theunselfishness of love could hallow even that dismal time!\'Who is there?\' said the trembling and hollow voice of one who hadpreceded them in their place of refuge.  \'Yet, what matters?--the crushof the ruined world forbids to us friends or foes.\'Ione turned at the sound of the voice, and, with a faint shriek, coweredagain beneath the arms of Glaucus: and he, looking in the direction ofthe voice, beheld the cause of her alarm.  Through the darkness glaredforth two burning eyes--the lightning flashed and lingered athwart thetemple--and Glaucus, with a shudder, perceived the lion to which he hadbeen doomed couched beneath the pillars--and, close beside it, unwittingof the vicinity, lay the giant form of him who had accosted them--thewounded gladiator, Niger.That lightning had revealed to each other the form of beast and man; yetthe instinct of both was quelled.  Nay, the lion crept nearer and nearerto the gladiator, as for companionship; and the gladiator did not recedeor tremble.  The revolution of Nature had dissolved her lighter terrorsas well as her wonted ties.While they were thus terribly protected, a group of men and women,bearing torches, passed by the temple.  They were of the congregation ofthe Nazarenes; and a sublime and unearthly emotion had not, indeed,quelled their awe, but it had robbed awe of fear.  They had longbelieved, according to the error of the early Christians, that the LastDay was at hand; they imagined now that the Day had come.\'Woe! woe!\' cried, in a shrill and piercing voice, the elder at theirhead. \'Behold! the Lord descendeth to judgment!  He maketh fire comedown from heaven in the sight of men!  Woe! woe! ye strong and mighty!Woe to ye of the fasces and the purple!  Woe to the idolater and theworshipper of the beast!  Woe to ye who pour forth the blood of saints,and gloat over the death-pangs of the sons of God!  Woe to the harlot ofthe sea!--woe! woe!\'And with a loud and deep chorus, the troop chanted forth along the wildhorrors of the air, \'Woe to the harlot of the sea!--woe! woe!\'The Nazarenes paced slowly on, their torches still flickering in thestorm, their voices still raised in menace and solemn warning, till,lost amid the windings in the streets, the darkness of the atmosphereand the silence of death again fell over the scene.There was one of the frequent pauses in the showers, and Glaucusencouraged Ione once more to proceed.  Just as they stood, hesitating,on the last step of the portico, an old man, with a bag in his righthand and leaning upon a youth, tottered by.  The youth bore a torch.Glaucus recognized the two as father and son--miser and prodigal.\'Father,\' said the youth, \'if you cannot move more swiftly, I must leaveyou, or we both perish!\'\'Fly, boy, then, and leave thy sire!\'\'But I cannot fly to starve; give me thy bag of gold!\' And the youthsnatched at it.\'Wretch! wouldst thou rob thy father?\'\'Ay! who can tell the tale in this hour?  Miser, perish!\'The boy struck the old man to the ground, plucked the bag from hisrelaxing hand, and fled onward with a shrill yell.\'Ye gods!\' cried Glaucus: \'are ye blind, then, even in the dark? Suchcrimes may well confound the guiltless with the guilty in one commonruin.  Ione, on!--on!\'Chapter VIIIARBACES ENCOUNTERS GLAUCUS AND IONE.ADVANCING, as men grope for escape in a dungeon, Ione and her lovercontinued their uncertain way.  At the moments when the volcaniclightnings lingered over the streets, they were enabled, by that awfullight, to steer and guide their progress: yet, little did the view itpresented to them cheer or encourage their path.  In parts, where theashes lay dry and uncommixed with the boiling torrents, cast upward fromthe mountain at capricious intervals, the surface of the earth presenteda leprous and ghastly white.  In other places, cinder and rock laymatted in heaps, from beneath which emerged the half-hid limbs of somecrushed and mangled fugitive.  The groans of the dying were broken bywild shrieks of women\'s terror--now near, now distant--which, when heardin the utter darkness, were rendered doubly appalling by the crushingsense of helplessness and the uncertainty of the perils around; andclear and distinct through all were the mighty and various noises fromthe Fatal Mountain; its rushing winds; its whirling torrents; and, fromtime to time, the burst and roar of some more fiery and fierceexplosion.  And ever as the winds swept howling along the street, theybore sharp streams of burning dust, and such sickening and poisonousvapors, as took away, for the instant, breath and consciousness,followed by a rapid revulsion of the arrested blood, and a tinglingsensation of agony trembling through every nerve and fibre of the frame.\'Oh, Glaucus! my beloved! my own!--take me to thy arms!  One embrace!let me feel thy arms around me--and in that embrace let me die--I can nomore!\'\'For my sake, for my life--courage, yet, sweet Ione--my life is linkedwith thine: and see--torches--this way!  Lo! how they brave the Wind!Ha! they live through the storm--doubtless, fugitives to the sea! wewill join them.\'As if to aid and reanimate the lovers, the winds and showers came to asudden pause; the atmosphere was profoundly still--the mountain seemedat rest, gathering, perhaps, fresh fury for its next burst; thetorch-bearers moved quickly on.  \'We are nearing the sea,\' said, in acalm voice, the person at their head.  \'Liberty and wealth to each slavewho survives this day!  Courage!  I tell you that the gods themselveshave assured me of deliverance.  On!\'Redly and steadily the torches flashed full on the eyes of Glaucus andIone, who lay trembling and exhausted on his bosom.  Several slaves werebearing, by the light, panniers and coffers, heavily laden; in front ofthem--a drawn sword in his hand--towered the lofty form of Arbaces.\'By my fathers!\' cried the Egyptian, \'Fate smiles upon me even throughthese horrors, and, amidst the dreadest aspects of woe and death, bodesme happiness and love.  Away, Greek!  I claim my ward, Ione!\'\'Traitor and murderer!\' cried Glaucus, glaring upon his foe, \'Nemesishath guided thee to my revenge!--a just sacrifice to the shades ofHades, that now seem loosed on earth.  Approach--touch but the hand ofIone, and thy weapon shall be as a reed--I will tear thee limb fromlimb!\'Suddenly, as he spoke, the place became lighted with an intense andlurid glow.  Bright and gigantic through the darkness, which closedaround it like the walls of hell, the mountain shone--a pile of fire!Its summit seemed riven in two; or rather, above its surface thereseemed to rise two monster shapes, each confronting each, as Demonscontending for a world.  These were of one deep blood-red hue of fire,which lighted up the whole atmosphere far and wide; but, below, thenether part of the mountain was still dark and shrouded, save in threeplaces, adown which flowed, serpentine and irregular, rivers of themolten lava.  Darkly red through the profound gloom of their banks, theyflowed slowly on, as towards the devoted city. Over the broadest thereseemed to spring a cragged and stupendous arch, from which, as from thejaws of hell, gushed the sources of the sudden Phlegethon.  And throughthe stilled air was heard the rattling of the fragments of rock,hurtling one upon another as they were borne down the fierycataracts--darkening, for one instant, the spot where they fell, andsuffused the next, in the burnished hues of the flood along which theyfloated!The slaves shrieked aloud, and, cowering, hid their faces.  The Egyptianhimself stood transfixed to the spot, the glow lighting up hiscommanding features and jewelled robes.  High behind him rose a tallcolumn that supported the bronze statue of Augustus; and the imperialimage seemed changed to a shape of fire!With his left hand circled round the form of Ione--with his right armraised in menace, and grasping the stilus which was to have been hisweapon in the arena, and which he still fortunately bore about him, withhis brow knit, his lips apart, the wrath and menace of human passionsarrested as by a charm, upon his features, Glaucus fronted the Egyptian!Arbaces turned his eyes from the mountain--they rested on the form ofGlaucus!  He paused a moment: \'Why,\' he muttered, \'should I hesitate?Did not the stars foretell the only crisis of imminent peril to which Iwas subjected?--Is not that peril past?\'\'The soul,\' cried he aloud, \'can brave the wreck of worlds and the wrathof imaginary gods!  By that soul will I conquer to the last! Advance,slaves!--Athenian, resist me, and thy blood be on thine own head!  Thus,then, I regain Ione!\'He advanced one step--it was his last on earth!  The ground shookbeneath him with a convulsion that cast all around upon its surface.  Asimultaneous crash resounded through the city, as down toppled many aroof and pillar!--the lightning, as if caught by the metal, lingered aninstant on the Imperial Statue--then shivered bronze and column! Downfell the ruin, echoing along the street, and riving the solid pavementwhere it crashed!--The prophecy of the stars was fulfilled!The sound--the shock, stunned the Athenian for several moments. When herecovered, the light still illuminated the scene--the earth still slidand trembled beneath!  Ione lay senseless on the ground; but he saw hernot yet--his eyes were fixed upon a ghastly face that seemed to emerge,without limbs or trunk, from the huge fragments of the shatteredcolumn--a face of unutterable pain, agony, and despair!  The eyes shutand opened rapidly, as if sense were not yet fled; the lips quivered andgrinned--then sudden stillness and darkness fell over the features, yetretaining that aspect of horror never to be forgotten!So perished the wise Magician--the great Arbaces--the Hermes of theBurning Belt--the last of the royalty of Egypt!Chapter IXTHE DESPAIR OF THE LOVERS.  THE CONDITION OF THE MULTITUDE.GLAUCUS turned in gratitude but in awe, caught Ione once more in hisarms, and fled along the street, that was yet intensely luminous.  Butsuddenly a duller shade fell over the air.  Instinctively he turned tothe mountain, and beheld! one of the two gigantic crests, into which thesummit had been divided, rocked and wavered to and fro; and then, with asound, the mightiness of which no language can describe, it fell fromits burning base, and rushed, an avalanche of fire, down the sides ofthe mountain!  At the same instant gushed forth a volume of blackestsmoke--rolling on, over air, sea, and earth.Another--and another--and another shower of ashes, far more profuse thanbefore, scattered fresh desolation along the streets. Darkness once morewrapped them as a veil; and Glaucus, his bold heart at last quelled anddespairing, sank beneath the cover of an arch, and, clasping Ione to hisheart--a bride on that couch of ruin--resigned himself to die.Meanwhile Nydia, when separated by the throng from Glaucus and Ione, hadin vain endeavored to regain them.  In vain she raised that plaintivecry so peculiar to the blind; it was lost amidst a thousand shrieks ofmore selfish terror.  Again and again she returned to the spot wherethey had been divided--to find her companions gone, to seize everyfugitive--to inquire of Glaucus--to be dashed aside in the impatience ofdistraction.  Who in that hour spared one thought to his neighbor?Perhaps in scenes of universal horror, nothing is more horrid than theunnatural selfishness they engender. At length it occurred to Nydia,that as it had been resolved to seek the sea-shore for escape, her mostprobable chance of rejoining her companions would be to persevere inthat direction.  Guiding her steps, then, by the staff which she alwayscarried, she continued, with incredible dexterity, to avoid the massesof ruin that encumbered the path--to thread the streets--and unerringly(so blessed now was that accustomed darkness, so afflicting in ordinarylife!) to take the nearest direction to the sea-side.Poor girl!--her courage was beautiful to behold!--and Fate seemed tofavor one so helpless!  The boiling torrents touched her not, save bythe general rain which accompanied them; the huge fragments of scoriashivered the pavement before and beside her, but spared that frail form:and when the lesser ashes fell over her, she shook them away with aslight tremor, and dauntlessly resumed her course.Weak, exposed, yet fearless, supported but by one wish, she was a veryemblem of Psyche in her wanderings; of Hope, walking through the Valleyof the Shadow; of the Soul itself--lone but undaunted, amidst thedangers and the snares of life!Her path was, however, constantly impeded by the crowds that now gropedamidst the gloom, now fled in the temporary glare of the lightningsacross the scene; and, at length, a group of torch-bearers rushing fullagainst her, she was thrown down with some violence.\'What!\' said the voice of one of the party, \'is this the brave blindgirl! By Bacchus, she must not be left here to die!  Up, my Thessalian!So--so. Are you hurt?  That\'s well!  Come along with us! we are for theshore!\'\'O Sallust! it is thy voice!  The gods be thanked!  Glaucus! Glaucus!Glaucus! have ye seen him?\'\'Not I.  He is doubtless out of the city by this time.  The gods whosaved him from the lion will save him from the burning mountain.\'As the kindly epicure thus encouraged Nydia, he drew her along with himtowards the sea, heeding not her passionate entreaties that he wouldlinger yet awhile to search for Glaucus; and still, in the accent ofdespair, she continued to shriek out that beloved name, which, amidstall the roar of the convulsed elements, kept alive a music at her heart.The sudden illumination, the bursts of the floods of lava, and theearthquake, which we have already described, chanced when Sallust andhis party had just gained the direct path leading from the city to theport; and here they were arrested by an immense crowd, more than halfthe population of the city.  They spread along the field without thewalls, thousands upon thousands, uncertain whither to fly.  The sea hadretired far from the shore; and they who had fled to it had been soterrified by the agitation and preternatural shrinking of the element,the gasping forms of the uncouth sea things which the waves had leftupon the sand, and by the sound of the huge stones cast from themountain into the deep, that they had returned again to the land, aspresenting the less frightful aspect of the two.  Thus the two streamsof human beings, the one seaward, the other from the sea, had mettogether, feeling a sad comfort in numbers; arrested in despair anddoubt.\'The world is to be destroyed by fire,\' said an old man in long looserobes, a philosopher of the Stoic school: \'Stoic and Epicurean wisdomhave alike agreed in this prediction: and the hour is come!\'\'Yea; the hour is come!\' cried a loud voice, solemn, but not fearful.Those around turned in dismay.  The voice came from above them. It wasthe voice of Olinthus, who, surrounded by his Christian friends, stoodupon an abrupt eminence on which the old Greek colonists had raised atemple to Apollo, now timeworn and half in ruin.As he spoke there came that sudden illumination which had heralded thedeath of Arbaces, and glowing over that mighty multitude, awed,crouching, breathless--never on earth had the faces of men seemed sohaggard!--never had meeting of mortal beings been so stamped with thehorror and sublimity of dread!--never till the last trumpet sounds,shall such meeting be seen again!  And above those the form of Olinthus,with outstretched arm and prophet brow, girt with the living fires.  Andthe crowd knew the face of him they had doomed to the fangs of thebeast--then their victim--now their warner! and through the stillnessagain came his ominous voice:\'The hour is come!\'The Christians repeated the cry.  It was caught up--it was echoed fromside to side--woman and man, childhood and old age, repeated, not aloud,but in a smothered and dreary murmur:\'THE HOUR IS COME!\'At that moment, a wild yell burst through the air--and, thinking only ofescape, whither it knew not, the terrible tiger of the desert leapedamongst the throng, and hurried through its parted streams.  And so camethe earthquake--and so darkness once more fell over the earth!And now new fugitives arrived.  Grasping the treasures no longerdestined for their lord, the slaves of Arbaces joined the throng. Oneonly of all their torches yet flickered on.  It was borne by Sosia; andits light falling on the face of Nydia, he recognized the Thessalian.\'What avails thy liberty now, blind girl?\' said the slave.\'Who art thou? canst thou tell me of Glaucus?\'\'Ay; I saw him but a few minutes since.\'\'Blessed be thy head! where?\'\'Crouched beneath the arch of the forum--dead or dying!--gone to rejoinArbaces, who is no more!\'Nydia uttered not a word, she slid from the side of Sallust; silentlyshe glided through those behind her, and retraced her steps to the city.She gained the forum--the arch; she stooped down--she felt around--shecalled on the name of Glaucus.A weak voice answered--\'Who calls on me?  Is it the voice of the Shades?Lo! I am prepared!\'\'Arise! follow me!  Take my hand! Glaucus, thou shalt be saved!\'In wonder and sudden hope, Glaucus arose--\'Nydia still?  Ah! thou, then,art safe!\'The tender joy of his voice pierced the heart of the poor Thessalian,and she blessed him for his thought of her.Half leading, half carrying Ione, Glaucus followed his guide.  Withadmirable discretion, she avoided the path which led to the crowd shehad just quitted, and, by another route, sought the shore.After many pauses and incredible perseverance, they gained the sea, andjoined a group, who, bolder than the rest, resolved to hazard any perilrather than continue in such a scene.  In darkness they put forth tosea; but, as they cleared the land and caught new aspects of themountain, its channels of molten fire threw a partial redness over thewaves.Utterly exhausted and worn out, Ione slept on the breast of Glaucus, andNydia lay at his feet.  Meanwhile the showers of dust and ashes, stillborne aloft, fell into the wave, and scattered their snows over thedeck.  Far and wide, borne by the winds, those showers descended uponthe remotest climes, startling even the swarthy African; and whirledalong the antique soil of Syria and of Egypt (Dion Cassius).Chapter XTHE NEXT MORNING.  THE FATE OF NYDIA.AND meekly, softly, beautifully, dawned at last the light over thetrembling deep!--the winds were sinking into rest--the foam died fromthe glowing azure of that delicious sea.  Around the east, thin mistscaught gradually the rosy hues that heralded the morning; Light wasabout to resume her reign.  Yet, still, dark and massive in thedistance, lay the broken fragments of the destroying cloud, from whichred streaks, burning dimlier and more dim, betrayed the yet rollingfires of the mountain of the \'Scorched Fields\'.  The white walls andgleaming columns that had adorned the lovely coasts were no more.Sullen and dull were the shores so lately crested by the cities ofHerculaneum and Pompeii.  The darlings of the deep were snatched fromher embrace!  Century after century shall the mighty Mother stretchforth her azure arms, and know them not--moaning round the sepulchres ofthe Lost!There was no shout from the mariners at the dawning light--it had cometoo gradually, and they were too wearied for such sudden bursts ofjoy--but there was a low, deep murmur of thankfulness amidst thosewatchers of the long night.  They looked at each other and smiled--theytook heart--they felt once more that there was a world around, and a Godabove them!  And in the feeling that the worst was passed, theoverwearied ones turned round, and fell placidly to sleep. In thegrowing light of the skies there came the silence which night hadwanted: and the bark drifted calmly onward to its port.  A few othervessels, bearing similar fugitives, might be seen in the expanse,apparently motionless, yet gliding also on.  There was a sense ofsecurity, of companionship, and of hope, in the sight of their slendermasts and white sails.  What beloved friends, lost and missed in thegloom, might they not bear to safety and to shelter!In the silence of the general sleep, Nydia rose gently.  She bent overthe face of Glaucus--she inhaled the deep breath of his heavyslumber--timidly and sadly she kissed his brow--his lips; she felt forhis hand--it was locked in that of Ione; she sighed deeply, and her facedarkened. Again she kissed his brow, and with her hair wiped from it thedamps of night.  \'May the gods bless you, Athenian!\' she murmured: \'mayyou be happy with your beloved one!--may you sometimes remember Nydia!Alas! she is of no further use on earth!\'With these words she turned away.  Slowly she crept along by the fori,or platforms, to the farther side of the vessel, and, pausing, bent lowover the deep; the cool spray dashed upward on her feverish brow.  \'Itis the kiss of death,\' she said \'it is welcome.\' The balmy air playedthrough her waving tresses--she put them from her face, and raised thoseeyes--so tender, though so lightless--to the sky, whose soft face shehad never seen!\'No, no!\' she said, half aloud, and in a musing and thoughtful tone, \'Icannot endure it; this jealous, exacting love--it shatters my whole soulin madness!  I might harm him again--wretch that I was!  I have savedhim--twice saved him--happy, happy thought: why not die happy?--it isthe last glad thought I can ever know.  Oh! sacred Sea!  I hear thyvoice invitingly--it hath a freshening and joyous call. They say that inthy embrace is dishonour--that thy victims cross not the fatal Styx--beit so!--I would not meet him in the Shades, for I should meet him stillwith her!  Rest--rest--rest! there is no other Elysium for a heart likemine!\'A sailor, half dozing on the deck, heard a slight splash on the waters.Drowsily he looked up, and behind, as the vessel merrily bounded on, hefancied he saw something white above the waves; but it vanished in aninstant.  He turned round again, and dreamed of his home and children.When the lovers awoke, their first thought was of each other--their nextof Nydia!  She was not to be found--none had seen her since the night.Every crevice of the vessel was searched--there was no trace of her.Mysterious from first to last, the blind Thessalian had vanished forever from the living world!  They guessed her fate in silence: andGlaucus and Ione, while they drew nearer to each other (feeling eachother the world itself), forgot their deliverance, and wept as for adeparted sister.Chapter The LastWHEREIN ALL THINGS CEASE LETTER FROM GLAUCUS TO SALLUST, TEN YEARS AFTERTHE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII.\'Athens.GLAUCUS to his beloved Sallust--greeting and health!--You request me tovisit you at Rome--no, Sallust, come rather to me at Athens!  I haveforsworn the Imperial City, its mighty tumult and hollow joys.  In myown land henceforth I dwell for ever.  The ghost of our departedgreatness is dearer to me than the gaudy life of your loud prosperity.There is a charm to me which no other spot can supply, in the porticoeshallowed still by holy and venerable shades.  In the olive-groves ofIlyssus I still hear the voice of poetry--on the heights of Phyle, theclouds of twilight seem yet the shrouds of departed freedom--theheralds--the heralds--of the morrow that shall come!  You smile at myenthusiasm, Sallust!--better be hopeful in chains than resigned to theirglitter.  You tell me you are sure that I cannot enjoy life in thesemelancholy haunts of a fallen majesty.  You dwell with rapture on theRoman splendors, and the luxuries of the imperial court. MySallust--""non sum qualis eram""--I am not what I was!  The events of mylife have sobered the bounding blood of my youth.  My health has neverquite recovered its wonted elasticity ere it felt the pangs of disease,and languished in the damps of a criminal\'s dungeon.  My mind has nevershaken off the dark shadow of the Last Day of Pompeii--the horror andthe desolation of that awful ruin!--Our beloved, our remembered Nydia! Ihave reared a tomb to her shade, and I see it every day from the windowof my study. It keeps alive in me a tender recollection--a notunpleasing sadness--which are but a fitting homage to her fidelity, andthe mysteriousness of her early death.  Ione gathers the flowers, but myown hand wreathes them daily around the tomb.  She was worthy of a tombin Athens!\'You speak of the growing sect of the Christians in Rome.  Sallust, toyou I may confide my secret; I have pondered much over that faith--Ihave adopted it.  After the destruction of Pompeii, I met once more withOlinthus--saved, alas! only for a day, and falling afterwards a martyrto the indomitable energy of his zeal.  In my preservation from the lionand the earthquake he taught me to behold the hand of the unknown God!I listened--believed--adored!  My own, my more than ever beloved Ione,has also embraced the creed!--a creed, Sallust, which, shedding lightover this world, gathers its concentrated glory, like a sunset, over thenext!  We know that we are united in the soul, as in the flesh, for everand for ever! Ages may roll on, our very dust be dissolved, the earthshrivelled like a scroll; but round and round the circle of eternityrolls the wheel of life--imperishable--unceasing!  And as the earth fromthe sun, so immortality drinks happiness from virtue, which is the smileupon the face of God!  Visit me, then, Sallust; bring with you thelearned scrolls of Epicurus, Pythagoras, Diogenes; arm yourself fordefeat; and let us, amidst the groves of Academus, dispute, under asurer guide than any granted to our fathers, on the mighty problem ofthe true ends of life and the nature of the soul.\'Ione--at that name my heart yet beats!--Ione is by my side as I write:I lift my eyes, and meet her smile.  The sunlight quivers over Hymettus:and along my garden I hear the hum of the summer bees.  Am I happy, askyou? Oh, what can Rome give me equal to what I possess at Athens?  Here,everything awakens the soul and inspires the affections--the trees, thewaters, the hills, the skies, are those of Athens!--fair, thoughmourning-mother of the Poetry and the Wisdom of the World.  In my hall Isee the marble faces of my ancestors.  In the Ceramicus, I survey theirtombs! In the streets, I behold the hand of Phidias and the soul ofPericles. Harmodius, Aristogiton--they are everywhere--but in ourhearts!--in mine, at least, they shall not perish!  If anything can makeme forget that I am an Athenian and not free, it is partly thesoothing--the love--watchful, vivid, sleepless--of Ione--a love that hastaken a new sentiment in our new creed--a love which none of our poets,beautiful though they be, had shadowed forth in description; for mingledwith religion, it partakes of religion; it is blended with pure andunworldly thoughts; it is that which we may hope to carry througheternity, and keep, therefore, white and unsullied, that we may notblush to confess it to our God!  This is the true type of the dark fableof our Grecian Eros and Psyche--it is, in truth, the soul asleep in thearms of love.  And if this, our love, support me partly against thefever of the desire for freedom, my religion supports me more; forwhenever I would grasp the sword and sound the shell, and rush to a newMarathon (but Marathon without victory), I feel my despair at thechilling thought of my country\'s impotence--the crushing weight of theRoman yoke, comforted, at least, by the thought that earth is but thebeginning of life--that the glory of a few years matters little in thevast space of eternity--that there is no perfect freedom till the chainsof clay fall from the soul, and all space, all time, become its heritageand domain.  Yet, Sallust, some mixture of the soft Greek blood stillmingles with my faith. I can share not the zeal of those who see crimeand eternal wrath in men who cannot believe as they.  I shudder not atthe creed of others.  I dare not curse them--I pray the Great Father toconvert.  This lukewarmness exposes me to some suspicion amongst theChristians: but I forgive it; and, not offending openly the prejudicesof the crowd, I am thus enabled to protect my brethren from the dangerof the law, and the consequences of their own zeal.  If moderation seemto me the natural creature of benevolence, it gives, also, the greatestscope to beneficence.\'Such, then, O Sallust! is my life--such my opinions.  In this manner Igreet existence and await death.  And thou, glad-hearted and kindlypupil of Epicurus, thou...  But come hither, and see what enjoyments,what hopes are ours--and not the splendor of imperial banquets, nor theshouts of the crowded circus, nor the noisy forum, nor the glitteringtheatre, nor the luxuriant gardens, nor the voluptuous baths ofRome--shall seem to thee to constitute a life of more vivid anduninterrupted happiness than that which thou so unreasonably pitiest asthe career of Glaucus the Athenian!--Farewell!\'Nearly Seventeen Centuries had rolled away when the City of Pompeii wasdisinterred from its silent tomb, all vivid with undimmed hues; itswalls fresh as if painted yesterday--not a hue faded on the rich mosaicof its floors--in its forum the half-finished columns as left by theworkman\'s hand--in its gardens the sacrificial tripod--in its halls thechest of treasure--in its baths the strigil--in its theatres the counterof admission--in its saloons the furniture and the lamp--in itstriclinia the fragments of the last feast--in its cubicula the perfumesand the rouge of faded beauty--and everywhere the bones and skeletons ofthose who once moved the springs of that minute yet gorgeous machine ofluxury and of life! In the house of Diomed, in the subterranean vaults,twenty skeletons (one of a babe) were discovered in one spot by thedoor, covered by a fine ashen dust, that had evidently been waftedslowly through the apertures, until it had filled the whole space.There were jewels and coins, candelabra for unavailing light, and winehardened in the amphorae for a prolongation of agonized life.  The sand,consolidated by damps, had taken the forms of the skeletons as in acast; and the traveler may yet see the impression of a female neck andbosom of young and round proportions--the trace of the fated Julia!  Itseems to the inquirer as if the air had been gradually changed into asulphurous vapor; the inmates of the vaults had rushed to the door, tofind it closed and blocked up by the scoria without, and in theirattempts to force it, had been suffocated with the atmosphere.In the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony hand, and nearit a bag of coins.  This is believed to have been the master of thehouse--the unfortunate Diomed, who had probably sought to escape by thegarden, and been destroyed either by the vapors or some fragment ofstone.  Beside some silver vases lay another skeleton, probably of aslave.The houses of Sallust and of Pansa, the Temple of Isis, with thejuggling concealments behind the statues--the lurking-place of its holyoracles--are now bared to the gaze of the curious.  In one of thechambers of that temple was found a huge skeleton with an axe beside it:two walls had been pierced by the axe--the victim could penetrate nofarther.  In the midst of the city was found another skeleton, by theside of which was a heap of coins, and many of the mystic ornaments ofthe fane of Isis.  Death had fallen upon him in his avarice, and Calenusperished simultaneously with Burbo!  As the excavators cleared onthrough the mass of ruin, they found the skeleton of a man literallysevered in two by a prostrate column; the skull was of so striking aconformation, so boldly marked in its intellectual as well as its worsephysical developments, that it has excited the constant speculation ofevery itinerant believer in the theories of Spurzheim who has gazed uponthat ruined palace of the mind.  Still, after the lapse of ages, thetraveler may survey that airy hall within whose cunning galleries andelaborate chambers once thought, reasoned, dreamed, and sinned, the soulof Arbaces the Egyptian.Viewing the various witnesses of a social system which has passed fromthe world for ever--a stranger, from that remote and barbarian Islewhich the Imperial Roman shivered when he named, paused amidst thedelights of the soft Campania and composed this history!
