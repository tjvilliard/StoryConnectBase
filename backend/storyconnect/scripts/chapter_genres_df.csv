85,The Lily of the Valley,3,"['II. FIRST LOVEThis scene took place on a Tuesday. I waited until Sunday and did notcross the river. During those five days great events were happening atClochegourde. The count received his brevet as general of brigade, thecross of Saint Louis, and a pension of four thousand francs. The Ducde Lenoncourt-Givry, made peer of France, recovered possession of twoforests, resumed his place at court, and his wife regained all herunsold property, which had been made part of the imperial crown lands.The Comtesse de Mortsauf thus became an heiress. Her mother had arrivedat Clochegourde, bringing her a hundred thousand francs economized atGivry, the amount of her dowry, still unpaid and never asked for by thecount in spite of his poverty. In all such matters of external life theconduct of this man was proudly disinterested. Adding to this sum hisown few savings he was able to buy two neighboring estates, which wouldyield him some nine thousand francs a year. His son would of coursesucceed to the grandfather\'s peerage, and the count now saw his way toentail the estate upon him without injury to Madeleine, for whom the Ducde Lenoncourt would no doubt assist in promoting a good marriage.These arrangements and this new happiness shed some balm upon thecount\'s sore mind. The presence of the Duchesse de Lenoncourt atClochegourde was a great event to the neighborhood. I reflected gloomilythat she was a great lady, and the thought made me conscious of thespirit of caste in the daughter which the nobility of her sentimentshad hitherto hidden from me. Who was I--poor, insignificant, and withno future but my courage and my faculties? I did not then think of theconsequences of the Restoration either for me or for others. On Sundaymorning, from the private chapel where I sat with Monsieur and Madamede Chessel and the Abbe de Quelus, I cast an eager glance at anotherlateral chapel occupied by the duchess and her daughter, the count andhis children. The large straw hat which hid my idol from me did nottremble, and this unconsciousness of my presence seemed to bind meto her more than all the past. This noble Henriette de Lenoncourt, myHenriette, whose life I longed to garland, was praying earnestly; faithgave to her figure an abandonment, a prosternation, the attitude of somereligious statue, which moved me to the soul.According to village custom, vespers were said soon after mass. Comingout of church Madame de Chessel naturally proposed to her neighbors topass the intermediate time at Frapesle instead of crossing the Indre andthe meadows twice in the great heat. The offer was accepted. Monsieur deChessel gave his arm to the duchess, Madame de Chessel took that of thecount. I offered mine to the countess, and felt, for the first time,that beautiful arm against my side. As we walked from the church toFrapesle by the woods of Sache, where the light, filtering down throughthe foliage, made those pretty patterns on the path which seem likepainted silk, such sensations of pride, such ideas took possession of methat my heart beat violently.""What is the matter?"" she said, after walking a little way in a silenceI dared not break. ""Your heart beats too fast--""""I have heard of your good fortune,"" I replied, ""and, like all otherswho love truly, I am beset with vague fears. Will your new dignitieschange you and lessen your friendship?""""Change me!"" she said; ""oh, fie! Another such idea and I shall--notdespise you, but forget you forever.""I looked at her with an ecstasy which should have been contagious.""We profit by the new laws which we have neither brought about nordemanded,"" she said; ""but we are neither place-hunters nor beggars;besides, as you know very well, neither Monsieur de Mortsauf nor I canleave Clochegourde. By my advice he has declined the command to whichhis rank entitled him at the Maison Rouge. We are quite content that myfather should have the place. This forced modesty,"" she added with somebitterness, ""has already been of service to our son. The king, to whosehousehold my father is appointed, said very graciously that hewould show Jacques the favor we were not willing to accept. Jacques\'education, which must now be thought of, is already being discussed.He will be the representative of two houses, the Lenoncourt and theMortsauf families. I can have no ambition except for him, and thereforemy anxieties seem to have increased. Not only must Jacques live, buthe must be made worthy of his name; two necessities which, as you know,conflict. And then, later, what friend will keep him safe for me inParis, where all things are pitfalls for the soul and dangers for thebody? My friend,"" she said, in a broken voice, ""who could not see uponyour brow and in your eyes that you are one who will inhabit heights?Be some day the guardian and sponsor of our boy. Go to Paris; if yourfather and brother will not second you, our family, above all my mother,who has a genius for the management of life, will help you. Profit byour influence; you will never be without support in whatever career youchoose; put the strength of your desires into a noble ambition--""""I understand you,"" I said, interrupting her; ""ambition is to be mymistress. I have no need of that to be wholly yours. No, I will not berewarded for my obedience here by receiving favors there. I will go;I will make my own way; I will rise alone. From you I would accepteverything, from others nothing.""""Child!"" she murmured, ill-concealing a smile of pleasure.""Besides, I have taken my vows,"" I went on. ""Thinking over our situationI am resolved to bind myself to you by ties that never can be broken.""She trembled slightly and stopped short to look at me.""What do you mean?"" she asked, letting the couples who preceded us walkon, and keeping the children at her side.""This,"" I said; ""but first tell me frankly how you wish me to love you.""""Love me as my aunt loved me; I gave you her rights when I permitted youto call me by the name which she chose for her own among my others.""""Then I am to love without hope and with an absolute devotion. Well,yes; I will do for you what some men do for God. I shall feel that youhave asked it. I will enter a seminary and make myself a priest, andthen I will educate your son. Jacques shall be myself in his own form;political conceptions, thoughts, energy, patience, I will give him all.In that way I shall live near to you, and my love, enclosed in religionas a silver image in a crystal shrine, can never be suspected of evil.You will not have to fear the undisciplined passions which grasp a manand by which already I have allowed myself to be vanquished. I willconsume my own being in the flame, and I will love you with a purifiedlove.""She turned pale and said, hurrying her words: ""Felix, do not putyourself in bonds that might prove an obstacle to our happiness. Ishould die of grief for having caused a suicide like that. Child, do youthink despairing love a life\'s vocation? Wait for life\'s trials beforeyou judge of life; I command it. Marry neither the Church nor a woman;marry not at all,--I forbid it. Remain free. You are twenty-one yearsold--My God! can I have mistaken him? I thought two months sufficed toknow some souls.""""What hope have you?"" I cried, with fire in my eyes.""My friend, accept our help, rise in life, make your way and yourfortune and you shall know my hope. And,"" she added, as if she werewhispering a secret, ""never release the hand you are holding at thismoment.""She bent to my ear as she said these words which proved her deepsolicitude for my future.""Madeleine!"" I exclaimed ""never!""We were close to a wooden gate which opened into the park of Frapesle;I still seem to see its ruined posts overgrown with climbing plants andbriers and mosses. Suddenly an idea, that of the count\'s death, flashedthrough my brain, and I said, ""I understand you.""""I am glad of it,"" she answered in a tone which made me know I hadsupposed her capable of a thought that could never be hers.Her purity drew tears of admiration from my eyes which the selfishnessof passion made bitter indeed. My mind reacted and I felt that she didnot love me enough even to wish for liberty. So long as love recoilsfrom a crime it seems to have its limits, and love should be infinite. Aspasm shook my heart.""She does not love me,"" I thought.To hide what was in my soul I stooped over Madeleine and kissed herhair.""I am afraid of your mother,"" I said to the countess presently, to renewthe conversation.""So am I,"" she answered with a gesture full of childlike gaiety. ""Don\'tforget to call her Madame la duchesse, and to speak to her in the thirdperson. The young people of the present day have lost these politemanners; you must learn them; do that for my sake. Besides, it is suchgood taste to respect women, no matter what their age may be, and torecognize social distinctions without disputing them. The respect shownto established superiority is guarantee for that which is due to you.Solidarity is the basis of society. Cardinal Della Rovere and Raffaellewere two powers equally revered. You have sucked the milk of theRevolution in your academy and your political ideas may be influenced byit; but as you advance in life you will find that crude and ill-definedprinciples of liberty are powerless to create the happiness of thepeople. Before considering, as a Lenoncourt, what an aristocracy oughtto be, my common-sense as a woman of the people tells me that societiescan exist only through a hierarchy. You are now at a turning-point inyour life, when you must choose wisely. Be on our side,--especiallynow,"" she added, laughing, ""when it triumphs.""I was keenly touched by these words, in which the depth of her politicalfeeling mingled with the warmth of affection,--a combination which givesto women so great a power of persuasion; they know how to give to thekeenest arguments a tone of feeling. In her desire to justify all herhusband\'s actions Henriette had foreseen the criticisms that would risein my mind as soon as I saw the servile effects of a courtier\'s lifeupon him. Monsieur de Mortsauf, king in his own castle and surroundedby an historic halo, had, to my eyes, a certain grandiose dignity. Iwas therefore greatly astonished at the distance he placed between theduchess and himself by manners that were nothing less than obsequious. Aslave has his pride and will only serve the greatest despots. I confessI was humiliated at the degradation of one before whom I trembled as thepower that ruled my love. This inward repulsion made me understand themartyrdom of women of generous souls yoked to men whose meannesses theybury daily. Respect is a safeguard which protects both great and smallalike; each side can hold its own. I was respectful to the duchessbecause of my youth; but where others saw only a duchess I saw themother of my Henriette, and that gave sanctity to my homage.We reached the great court-yard of Frapesle, where we found the others.The Comte de Mortsauf presented me very gracefully to the duchess, whoexamined me with a cold and reserved air. Madame de Lenoncourt was thena woman fifty-six years of age, wonderfully well preserved and withgrand manners. When I saw the hard blue eyes, the hollow temples, thethin emaciated face, the erect, imposing figure slow of movement, andthe yellow whiteness of the skin (reproduced with such brilliancy in thedaughter), I recognized the cold type to which my own mother belonged,as quickly as a mineralogist recognizes Swedish iron. Her language wasthat of the old court; she pronounced the ""oit"" like ""ait,"" and said""frait"" for ""froid,"" ""porteux"" for ""porteurs."" I was not a courtier,neither was I stiff-backed in my manner to her; in fact I behaved sowell that as I passed the countess she said in a low voice, ""You areperfect.""The count came to me and took my hand, saying: ""You are not angry withme, Felix, are you? If I was hasty you will pardon an old soldier? Weshall probably stay here to dinner, and I invite you to dine with uson Thursday, the evening before the duchess leaves. I must go to Toursto-morrow to settle some business. Don\'t neglect Clochegourde. Mymother-in-law is an acquaintance I advise you to cultivate. Hersalon will set the tone for the faubourg St. Germain. She has all thetraditions of the great world, and possesses an immense amount of socialknowledge; she knows the blazon of the oldest as well as the newestfamily in Europe.""The count\'s good taste, or perhaps the advice of his domestic genius,appeared under his altered circumstances. He was neither arrogant noroffensively polite, nor pompous in any way, and the duchess was notpatronizing. Monsieur and Madame de Chessel gratefully accepted theinvitation to dinner on the following Thursday. I pleased the duchess,and by her glance I knew she was examining a man of whom her daughterhad spoken to her. As we returned from vespers she questioned me aboutmy family, and asked if the Vandenesse now in diplomacy was my relative.""He is my brother,"" I replied. On that she became almost affectionate.She told me that my great-aunt, the old Marquise de Listomere, was aGrandlieu. Her manners were as cordial as those of Monsieur de Mortsaufthe day he saw me for the first time; the haughty glance with whichthese sovereigns of the earth make you measure the distance that liesbetween you and them disappeared. I knew almost nothing of my family.The duchess told me that my great-uncle, an old abbe whose very name Idid not know, was to be member of the privy council, that my brother wasalready promoted, and also that by a provision of the Charter, of whichI had not yet heard, my father became once more Marquis de Vandenesse.""I am but one thing, the serf of Clochegourde,"" I said in a low voice tothe countess.The transformation scene of the Restoration was carried through with arapidity which bewildered the generation brought up under the imperialregime. To me this revolution meant nothing. The least word or gesturefrom Madame de Mortsauf were the sole events to which I attachedimportance. I was ignorant of what the privy council was, and knewas little of politics as of social life; my sole ambition was to loveHenriette better than Petrarch loved Laura. This indifference made theduchess take me for a child. A large company assembled at Frapesle andwe were thirty at table. What intoxication it is for a young man unusedto the world to see the woman he loves more beautiful than all othersaround her, the centre of admiring looks; to know that for him alone isreserved the chaste fire of those eyes, that none but he can discern inthe tones of that voice, in the words it utters, however gay or jestingthey may be, the proofs of unremitting thought. The count, delightedwith the attentions paid to him, seemed almost young; his wife lookedhopeful of a change; I amused myself with Madeleine, who, like allchildren with bodies weaker than their minds, made others laugh with herclever observations, full of sarcasm, though never malicious, andwhich spared no one. It was a happy day. A word, a hope awakened in themorning illumined nature. Seeing me so joyous, Henriette was joyful too.""This happiness smiling on my gray and cloudy life seems good,"" she saidto me the next day.That day I naturally spent at Clochegourde. I had been banished for fivedays, I was athirst for life. The count left at six in the morning forTours. A serious disagreement had arisen between mother and daughter.The duchess wanted the countess to move to Paris, where she promised hera place at court, and where the count, reconsidering his refusal, mightobtain some high position. Henriette, who was thought happy inher married life, would not reveal, even to her mother, her tragicsufferings and the fatal incapacity of her husband. It was to hide hiscondition from the duchess that she persuaded him to go to Tours andtransact business with his notaries. I alone, as she had truly said,knew the dark secret of Clochegourde. Having learned by experiencehow the pure air and the blue sky of the lovely valley calmed theexcitements and soothed the morbid griefs of the diseased mind, and whatbeneficial effect the life at Clochegourde had upon the health of herchildren, she opposed her mother\'s desire that she should leave it withreasons which the overbearing woman, who was less grieved than mortifiedby her daughter\'s bad marriage, vigorously combated.Henriette saw that the duchess cared little for Jacques andMadeleine,--a terrible discovery! Like all domineering mothers whoexpect to continue the same authority over their married daughters thatthey maintained when they were girls, the duchess brooked no opposition;sometimes she affected a crafty sweetness to force her daughter tocompliance, at other times a cold severity, intending to obtain by fearwhat gentleness had failed to win; then, when all means failed, shedisplayed the same native sarcasm which I had often observed in my ownmother. In those ten days Henriette passed through all the contentions ayoung woman must endure to establish her independence. You, who for yourhappiness have the best of mothers, can scarcely comprehend such trials.To gain a true idea of the struggle between that cold, calculating,ambitious woman and a daughter abounding in the tender natural kindnessthat never faileth, you must imagine a lily, to which my heart hasalways compared her, bruised beneath the polished wheels of a steel car.That mother had nothing in common with her daughter; she was unableeven to imagine the real difficulties which hindered her from takingadvantage of the Restoration and forced her to continue a life ofsolitude. Though families bury their internal dissensions with theutmost care, enter behind the scenes, and you will find in nearly allof them deep, incurable wounds, which lessen the natural affections.Sometimes these wounds are given by passions real and most affecting,rendered eternal by the dignity of those who feel them; sometimes bylatent hatreds which slowly freeze the heart and dry all tears when thehour of parting comes. Tortured yesterday and to-day, wounded by all,even by the suffering children who were guiltless of the ills theyendured, how could that poor soul fail to love the one human being whodid not strike her, who would fain have built a wall of defence aroundher to guard her from storms, from harsh contacts and cruel blows?Though I suffered from a knowledge of these debates, there were momentswhen I was happy in the sense that she rested upon my heart; for shetold me of these new troubles. Day by day I learned more fully themeaning of her words,--""Love me as my aunt loved me.""""Have you no ambition?"" the duchess said to me at dinner, with a sternair.""Madame,"" I replied, giving her a serious look, ""I have enough in me toconquer the world; but I am only twenty-one, and I am all alone.""She looked at her daughter with some astonishment. Evidently shebelieved that Henriette had crushed my ambition in order to keep menear her. The visit of Madame de Lenoncourt was a period of unrelievedconstraint. The countess begged me to be cautious; she was frightenedby the least kind word; to please her I wore the harness of deceit. Thegreat Thursday came; it was a day of wearisome ceremonial,--one ofthose stiff days which lovers hate, when their chair is no longer inits place, and the mistress of the house cannot be with them. Love has ahorror of all that does not concern itself. But the duchess returned atlast to the pomps and vanities of the court, and Clochegourde recoveredits accustomed order.My little quarrel with the count resulted in making me more at home inthe house than ever; I could go there at all times without hindrance;and the antecedents of my life inclined me to cling like a climbingplant to the beautiful soul which had opened to me the enchanting worldof shared emotions. Every hour, every minute, our fraternal marriage,founded on trust, became a surer thing; each of us settled firmly intoour own position; the countess enfolded me with her nurturing care, withthe white draperies of a love that was wholly maternal; while my lovefor her, seraphic in her presence, seared me as with hot irons whenaway from her. I loved her with a double love which shot its arrows ofdesire, and then lost them in the sky, where they faded out of sight inthe impermeable ether. If you ask me why, young and ardent, I continuedin the deluding dreams of Platonic love, I must own to you that I wasnot yet man enough to torture that woman, who was always in dread ofsome catastrophe to her children, always fearing some outburst of herhusband\'s stormy temper, martyrized by him when not afflicted by theillness of Jacques or Madeleine, and sitting beside one or the other ofthem when her husband allowed her a little rest. The mere sound of toowarm a word shook her whole being; a desire shocked her; what she neededwas a veiled love, support mingled with tenderness,--that, in short,which she gave to others. Then, need I tell you, who are so trulyfeminine? this situation brought with it hours of delightful languor,moments of divine sweetness and content which followed by secretimmolation. Her conscience was, if I may call it so, contagious; herself-devotion without earthly recompense awed me by its persistence; theliving, inward piety which was the bond of her other virtues filledthe air about her with spiritual incense. Besides, I was young,--youngenough to concentrate my whole being on the kiss she allowed me tooseldom to lay upon her hand, of which she gave me only the back, andnever the palm, as though she drew the line of sensual emotions there.No two souls ever clasped each other with so much ardor, no bodies wereever more victoriously annihilated. Later I understood the cause of thissufficing joy. At my age no worldly interests distracted my heart; noambitions blocked the stream of a love which flowed like a torrent,bearing all things on its bosom. Later, we love the woman in a woman;but the first woman we love is the whole of womanhood; her children areours, her interests are our interests, her sorrows our greatest sorrow;we love her gown, the familiar things about her; we are more grieved bya trifling loss of hers than if we knew we had lost everything. Thisis the sacred love that makes us live in the being of another; whereaslater, alas! we draw another life into ours, and require a woman toenrich our pauper spirit with her young soul.I was now one of the household, and I knew for the first time aninfinite sweetness, which to a nature bruised as mine was like a bathto a weary body; the soul is refreshed in every fibre, comforted to itsvery depths. You will hardly understand me, for you are a woman, andI am speaking now of a happiness women give but do not receive. A manalone knows the choice happiness of being, in the midst of a strangehousehold, the privileged friend of its mistress, the secret centreof her affections. No dog barks at you; the servants, like the dogs,recognize your rights; the children (who are never misled, and know thattheir power cannot be lessened, and that you cherish the light of theirlife), the children possess the gift of divination, they play with youlike kittens and assume the friendly tyranny they show only to thosethey love; they are full of intelligent discretion and come and go ontiptoe without noise. Every one hastens to do you service; all like you,and smile upon you. True passions are like beautiful flowers all themore charming to the eye when they grow in a barren soil.But if I enjoyed the delightful benefits of naturalization in a familywhere I found relations after my own heart, I had also to pay some costsfor it. Until then Monsieur de Mortsauf had more or less restrainedhimself before me. I had only seen his failings in the mass; I wasnow to see the full extent of their application and discover how noblycharitable the countess had been in the account she had given me ofthese daily struggles. I learned now all the angles of her husband\'sintolerable nature; I heard his perpetual scolding about nothing,complaints of evils of which not a sign existed; I saw the inwarddissatisfaction which poisoned his life, and the incessant need of histyrannical spirit for new victims. When we went to walk in the eveningshe selected the way; but whichever direction we took he was alwaysbored; when we reached home he blamed others; his wife had insisted ongoing where she wanted; why was he governed by her in all the triflingthings of life? was he to have no will, no thought of his own? musthe consent to be a cipher in his own house? If his harshness was to bereceived in patient silence he was angry because he felt a limit to hispower; he asked sharply if religion did not require a wife to pleaseher husband, and whether it was proper to despise the father of herchildren? He always ended by touching some sensitive chord in his wife\'smind; and he seemed to find a domineering pleasure in making it sound.Sometimes he tried gloomy silence and a morbid depression, which alwaysalarmed his wife and made her pay him the most tender attentions.Like petted children, who exercise their power without thinking of thedistress of their mother, he would let her wait upon him as upon Jacquesand Madeleine, of whom he was jealous.I discovered at last that in small things as well as in great ones thecount acted towards his servants, his children, his wife, precisely ashe had acted to me about the backgammon. The day when I understood,root and branch, these difficulties, which like a rampant overgrowthrepressed the actions and stifled the breathing of the whole family,hindered the management of the household and retarded the improvement ofthe estate by complicating the most necessary acts, I felt an admiringawe which rose higher than my love and drove it back into my heart. GoodGod! what was I? Those tears that I had taken on my lips solemnizedmy spirit; I found happiness in wedding the sufferings of that woman.Hitherto I had yielded to the count\'s despotism as the smuggler pays hisfine; henceforth I was a voluntary victim that I might come the nearerto her. The countess understood me, allowed me a place beside her, andgave me permission to share her sorrows; like the repentant apostate,eager to rise to heaven with his brethren, I obtained the favor of dyingin the arena.""Were it not for you I must have succumbed under this life,"" Henriettesaid to me one evening when the count had been, like the flies on a hotday, more stinging, venomous, and persistent than usual.He had gone to bed. Henriette and I remained under the acacias; thechildren were playing about us, bathed in the setting sun. Our fewexclamatory words revealed the mutuality of the thoughts in which werested from our common sufferings. When language failed silence asfaithfully served our souls, which seemed to enter one another withouthindrance; together they luxuriated in the charms of pensive languor,they met in the undulations of the same dream, they plunged as one intothe river and came out refreshed like two nymphs as closely united astheir souls could wish, but with no earthly tie to bind them. We enteredthe unfathomable gulf, we returned to the surface with empty hands,asking each other by a look, ""Among all our days on earth will there beone for us?""In spite of the tranquil poetry of evening which gave to the bricks ofthe balustrade their orange tones, so soothing and so pure; in spite ofthe religious atmosphere of the hour, which softened the voices of thechildren and wafted them towards us, desire crept through my veins likethe match to the bonfire. After three months of repression I was unableto content myself with the fate assigned me. I took Henriette\'s hand andsoftly caressed it, trying to convey to her the ardor that invaded me.She became at once Madame de Mortsauf, and withdrew her hand; tearsrolled from my eyes, she saw them and gave me a chilling look, as sheoffered her hand to my lips.""You must know,"" she said, ""that this will cause me grief. A friendshipthat asks so great a favor is dangerous.""Then I lost my self-control; I reproached her, I spoke of my sufferings,and the slight alleviation that I asked for them. I dared to tell herthat at my age, if the senses were all soul still the soul had a sex;that I could meet death, but not with closed lips. She forced me tosilence with her proud glance, in which I seemed to read the cry of theMexican: ""And I, am I on a bed of roses?"" Ever since that day by thegate of Frapesle, when I attributed to her the hope that our happinessmight spring from a grave, I had turned with shame from the thought ofstaining her soul with the desires of a brutal passion. She now spokewith honeyed lip, and told me that she never could be wholly mine, andthat I ought to know it. As she said the words I know that in obeyingher I dug an abyss between us. I bowed my head. She went on, saying shehad an inward religious certainty that she might love me as a brotherwithout offending God or man; such love was a living image of the divinelove, which her good Saint-Martin told her was the life of the world.If I could not be to her somewhat as her old confessor was, less than alover yet more than a brother, I must never see her again. She coulddie and take to God her sheaf of sufferings, borne not without tears andanguish.""I gave you,"" she said in conclusion, ""more than I ought to have given,so that nothing might be left to take, and I am punished.""I was forced to calm her, to promise never to cause her pain, and tolove her at twenty-one years of age as old men love their youngestchild.The next day I went early. There were no flowers in the vases of hergray salon. I rushed into the fields and vineyards to make her twobouquets; but as I gathered the flowers, one by one, cutting their longstalks and admiring their beauty, the thought occurred to me that thecolors and foliage had a poetry, a harmony, which meant something tothe understanding while they charmed the eye; just as musical melodiesawaken memories in hearts that are loving and beloved. If color is lightorganized, must it not have a meaning of its own, as the combinationsof the air have theirs? I called in the assistance of Jacques andMadeleine, and all three of us conspired to surprise our dear one. Iarranged, on the lower steps of the portico, where we establishedour floral headquarters, two bouquets by which I tried to convey asentiment. Picture to yourself a fountain of flowers gushing from thevases and falling back in curving waves; my message springing from itsbosom in white roses and lilies with their silver cups. All the blueflowers, harebells, forget-me-nots, and ox-tongues, whose tines, caughtfrom the skies, blended so well with the whiteness of the lilies,sparkled on this dewy texture; were they not the type of two purities,the one that knows nothing, the other that knows all; an image of thechild, an image of the martyr? Love has its blazon, and the countessdiscerned it inwardly. She gave me a poignant glance which was likethe cry of a soldier when his wound is touched; she was humbled butenraptured too. My reward was in that glance; to refresh her heart, tohave given her comfort, what encouragement for me! Then it was thatI pressed the theories of Pere Castel into the service of love, andrecovered a science lost to Europe, where written pages have supplantedthe flowery missives of the Orient with their balmy tints. What charm inexpressing our sensations through these daughters of the sun, sisters tothe flowers that bloom beneath the rays of love! Before long I communedwith the flora of the fields, as a man whom I met in after days atGrandlieu communed with his bees.Twice a week during the remainder of my stay at Frapesle I continued theslow labor of this poetic enterprise, for the ultimate accomplishment ofwhich I needed all varieties of herbaceous plants; into these I made adeep research, less as a botanist than as a poet, studying their spiritrather than their form. To find a flower in its native haunts I walkedenormous distances, beside the brooklets, through the valleys, to thesummit of the cliffs, across the moorland, garnering thoughts even fromthe heather. During these rambles I initiated myself into pleasuresunthought of by the man of science who lives in meditation, unknown tothe horticulturist busy with specialities, to the artisan fettered toa city, to the merchant fastened to his desk, but known to a fewforesters, to a few woodsmen, and to some dreamers. Nature can showeffects the significations of which are limitless; they rise to thegrandeur of the highest moral conceptions--be it the heather in bloom,covered with the diamonds of the dew on which the sunlight dances;infinitude decked for the single glance that may chance to fall uponit:--be it a corner of the forest hemmed in with time-worn rockscrumbling to gravel and clothed with mosses overgrown with juniper,which grasps our minds as something savage, aggressive, terrifying asthe cry of the kestrel issuing from it:--be it a hot and barren moorwithout vegetation, stony, rigid, its horizon like those of the desert,where once I gathered a sublime and solitary flower, the anemonepulsatilla, with its violet petals opening for the golden stamens;affecting image of my pure idol alone in her valley:--be it great sheetsof water, where nature casts those spots of greenery, a species oftransition between the plant and animal, where life makes haste to comein flowers and insects, floating there like worlds in ether:--be ita cottage with its garden of cabbages, its vineyards, its hedgesoverhanging a bog, surrounded by a few sparse fields of rye; true imageof many humble existences:--be it a forest path like some cathedralnave, where the trees are columns and their branches arch the roof, atthe far end of which a light breaks through, mingled with shadows ortinted with sunset reds athwart the leaves which gleam like the coloredwindows of a chancel:--then, leaving these woods so cool and branchy,behold a chalk-land lying fallow, where among the warm and cavernousmosses adders glide to their lairs, or lift their proud slim heads. Castupon all these pictures torrents of sunlight like beneficent waters,or the shadow of gray clouds drawn in lines like the wrinkles of an oldman\'s brow, or the cool tones of a sky faintly orange and streaked withlines of a paler tint; then listen--you will hear indefinable harmoniesamid a silence which blends them all.During the months of September and October I did not make a singlebouquet which cost me less than three hours search; so much did Iadmire, with the real sympathy of a poet, these fugitive allegories ofhuman life, that vast theatre I was about to enter, the scenes of whichmy memory must presently recall. Often do I now compare those splendidscenes with memories of my soul thus expending itself on nature; again Iwalk that valley with my sovereign, whose white robe brushed the coppiceand floated on the green sward, whose spirit rose, like a promisedfruit, from each calyx filled with amorous stamens.No declaration of love, no vows of uncontrollable passion ever conveyedmore than these symphonies of flowers; my baffled desires impelled me toefforts of expression through them like those of Beethoven through hisnotes, to the same bitter reactions, to the same mighty bounds towardsheaven. In their presence Madame de Mortsauf was my Henriette. Shelooked at them constantly; they fed her spirit, she gathered all thethoughts I had given them, saying, as she raised her head from theembroidery frame to receive my gift, ""Ah, how beautiful!""Natalie, you will understand this delightful intercourse through thedetails of a bouquet, just as you would comprehend Saadi from a fragmentof his verse. Have you ever smelt in the fields in the month of May theperfume that communicates to all created beings the intoxicating senseof a new creation; the sense that makes you trail your hand in the waterfrom a boat, and loosen your hair to the breeze while your mind reviveswith the springtide greenery of the trees? A little plant, a species ofvernal grass, is a powerful element in this veiled harmony; it cannot beworn with impunity; take into your hand its shining blade, striped greenand white like a silken robe, and mysterious emotions will stir therosebuds your modesty keeps hidden in the depths of your heart. Roundthe neck of a porcelain vase imagine a broad margin of the gray-whitetufts peculiar to the sedum of the vineyards of Touraine, vague imageof submissive forms; from this foundation come tendrils of the bind-weedwith its silver bells, sprays of pink rest-barrow mingled with a fewyoung shoots of oak-leaves, lustrous and magnificently colored;these creep forth prostrate, humble as the weeping-willow, timid andsupplicating as prayer. Above, see those delicate threads of the purpleamoret, with its flood of anthers that are nearly yellow; the snowypyramids of the meadow-sweet, the green tresses of the wild oats, theslender plumes of the agrostis, which we call wind-ear; roseate hopes,decking love\'s earliest dream and standing forth against the graysurroundings. But higher still, remark the Bengal roses, sparselyscattered among the laces of the daucus, the plumes of the linaria, themarabouts of the meadow-queen; see the umbels of the myrrh, the spunglass of the clematis in seed, the dainty petals of the cross-wort,white as milk, the corymbs of the yarrow, the spreading stems of thefumitory with their black and rosy blossoms, the tendrils of the grape,the twisted shoots of the honeysuckle; in short, all the innocentcreatures have that is most tangled, wayward, wild,--flames and tripledarts, leaves lanceolated or jagged, stalks convoluted like passionatedesires writhing in the soul. From the bosom of this torrent of loverises the scarlet poppy, its tassels about to open, spreading itsflaming flakes above the starry jessamine, dominating the rain ofpollen--that soft mist fluttering in the air and reflecting the light inits myriad particles. What woman intoxicated with the odor of the vernalgrasses would fail to understand this wealth of offered thoughts, theseardent desires of a love demanding the happiness refused in a hundredstruggles which passion still renews, continuous, unwearying, eternal!Put this speech of the flowers in the light of a window to show itscrisp details, its delicate contrasts, its arabesques of color, andallow the sovereign lady to see a tear upon some petal more expandedthan the rest. What do we give to God? perfumes, light, and song, thepurest expression of our nature. Well, these offerings to God, are theynot likewise offered to love in this poem of luminous flowers murmuringtheir sadness to the heart, cherishing its hidden transports, itsunuttered hopes, its illusions which gleam and fall to fragments likethe gossamer of a summer\'s night?Such neutral pleasures help to soothe a nature irritated by longcontemplation of the person beloved. They were to me, I dare not say toher, like those fissures in a dam through which the water finds a ventand avoids disaster. Abstinence brings deadly exhaustion, which afew crumbs falling from heaven like manna in the desert, suffices torelieve. Sometimes I found my Henriette standing before these bouquetswith pendant arms, lost in agitated reverie, thoughts swelling herbosom, illumining her brow as they surged in waves and sank again,leaving lassitude and languor behind them. Never again have I made abouquet for any one. When she and I had created this language and formedit to our uses, a satisfaction filled our souls like that of a slave whoescapes his masters.During the rest of this month as I came from the meadows through thegardens I often saw her face at the window, and when I reached the salonshe was ready at her embroidery frame. If I did not arrive at the hourexpected (though never appointed), I saw a white form wandering on theterrace, and when I joined her she would say, ""I came to meet you; Imust show a few attentions to my youngest child.""The miserable games of backgammon had come to end. The count\'s latepurchases took all his time in going hither and thither about theproperty, surveying, examining, and marking the boundaries of his newpossessions. He had orders to give, rural works to overlook which neededa master\'s eye,--all of them planned and decided on by his wife andhimself. We often went to meet him, the countess and I, with thechildren, who amused themselves on the way by running after insects,stag-beetles, darning-needles, they too making their bouquets, or tospeak more truly, their bundles of flowers. To walk beside the woman welove, to take her on our arm, to guide her steps,--these are illimitablejoys that suffice a lifetime. Confidence is then complete. We wentalone, we returned with the ""general,"" a title given to the count whenhe was good-humored. These two ways of taking the same path gave lightand shade to our pleasure, a secret known only to hearts debarred fromunion. Our talk, so free as we went, had hidden significations aswe returned, when either of us gave an answer to some furtiveinterrogation, or continued a subject, already begun, in the enigmaticphrases to which our language lends itself, and which women are soingenious in composing. Who has not known the pleasure of such secretunderstandings in a sphere apart from those about us, a sphere wherespirits meet outside of social laws?One day a wild hope, quickly dispelled, took possession of me, when thecount, wishing to know what we were talking of, put the inquiry,and Henriette answered in words that allowed another meaning, whichsatisfied him. This amused Madeleine, who laughed; after a moment hermother blushed and gave me a forbidding look, as if to say she mightstill withdraw from me her soul as she had once withdrawn her hand. Butour purely spiritual union had far too many charms, and on the morrow itcontinued as before.The hours, days, and weeks fled by, filled with renascent joys. Grapeharvest, the festal season in Touraine, began. Toward the end ofSeptember the sun, less hot than during the wheat harvest, allows of ourstaying in the vineyards without danger of becoming overheated. It iseasier to gather grapes than to mow wheat. Fruits of all kinds are ripe,harvests are garnered, bread is less dear; the sense of plenty makes thecountry people happy. Fears as to the results of rural toil, in whichmore money than sweat is often spent, vanish before a full granary andcellars about to overflow. The vintage is then like a gay dessert afterthe dinner is eaten; the skies of Touraine, where the autumns are alwaysmagnificent, smile upon it. In this hospitable land the vintagersare fed and lodged in the master\'s house. The meals are the onlyones throughout the year when these poor people taste substantial,well-cooked food; and they cling to the custom as the children ofpatriarchal families cling to anniversaries. As the time approaches theyflock in crowds to those houses where the masters are known to treat thelaborers liberally. The house is full of people and of provisions. Thepresses are open. The country is alive with the coming and going ofitinerant coopers, of carts filled with laughing girls and joyoushusbandmen, who earn better wages than at any other time duringthe year, and who sing as they go. There is also another cause ofpleasurable content: classes and ranks are equal; women, children,masters, and men, all that little world, share in the garnering ofthe divine hoard. These various elements of satisfaction explain thehilarity of the vintage, transmitted from age to age in these lastglorious days of autumn, the remembrance of which inspired Rabelais withthe bacchic form of his great work.The children, Jacques and Madeleine, had never seen a vintage; I waslike them, and they were full of infantine delight at finding a sharerof their pleasure; their mother, too, promised to accompany us. We wentto Villaines, where baskets are manufactured, in quest of the prettiestthat could be bought; for we four were to cut certain rows reserved forour scissors; it was, however, agreed that none of us were to eat toomany grapes. To eat the fat bunches of Touraine in a vineyard seemedso delicious that we all refused the finest grapes on the dinner-table.Jacques made me swear I would go to no other vineyard, but stay closelyat Clochegourde. Never were these frail little beings, usually pallidand smiling, so fresh and rosy and active as they were this morning.They chattered for chatter\'s sake, and trotted about without apparentobject; they suddenly seemed, like other children, to have more lifethan they needed; neither Monsieur nor Madame de Mortsauf had ever seenthem so before. I became a child again with them, more of a child thaneither of them, perhaps; I, too, was hoping for my harvest. It wasglorious weather when we went to the vineyard, and we stayed there halfthe day. How we disputed as to who had the finest grapes and who couldfill his basket quickest! The little human shoots ran to and fro fromthe vines to their mother; not a bunch could be cut without showing itto her. She laughed with the good, gay laugh of her girlhood when I,running up with my basket after Madeleine, cried out, ""Mine too! Seemine, mamma!"" To which she answered: ""Don\'t get overheated, dear child.""Then passing her hand round my neck and through my hair, she added,giving me a little tap on the cheek, ""You are melting away."" It wasthe only caress she ever gave me. I looked at the pretty line of purpleclusters, the hedges full of haws and blackberries; I heard the voicesof the children; I watched the trooping girls, the cart loaded withbarrels, the men with the panniers. Ah, it is all engraved on my memory,even to the almond-tree beside which she stood, girlish, rosy, smiling,beneath the sunshade held open in her hand. Then I busied myself incutting the bunches and filling my basket, going forward to empty itin the vat, silently, with measured bodily movement and slow steps thatleft my spirit free. I discovered then the ineffable pleasure of anexternal labor which carries life along, and thus regulates the rush ofpassion, often so near, but for this mechanical motion, to kindleinto flame. I learned how much wisdom is contained in uniform labor; Iunderstood monastic discipline.For the first time in many days the count was neither surly nor cruel.His son was so well; the future Duc de Lenoncourt-Mortsauf, fair androsy and stained with grape-juice, rejoiced his heart. This daybeing the last of the vintage, he had promised a dance in front ofClochegourde in honor of the return of the Bourbons, so that ourfestival gratified everybody. As we returned to the house, the countesstook my arm and leaned upon it, as if to let my heart feel the weight ofhers,--the instinctive movement of a mother who seeks to convey her joy.Then she whispered in my ear, ""You bring us happiness.""Ah, to me, who knew her sleepless nights, her cares, her fears, herformer existence, in which, although the hand of God sustained her, allwas barren and wearisome, those words uttered by that rich voice broughtpleasures no other woman in the world could give me.""The terrible monotony of my life is broken, all things are radiant withhope,"" she said after a pause. ""Oh, never leave me! Do not despise myharmless superstitions; be the elder son, the protector of the younger.""In this, Natalie, there is nothing romantic. To know the infinite of ourdeepest feelings, we must in youth cast our lead into those greatlakes upon whose shores we live. Though to many souls passions are lavatorrents flowing among arid rocks, other souls there be in whom passion,restrained by insurmountable obstacles, fills with purest water thecrater of the volcano.We had still another fete. Madame de Mortsauf, wishing to accustomher children to the practical things of life, and to give them someexperience of the toil by which men earn their living, had providedeach of them with a source of income, depending on the chances ofagriculture. To Jacques she gave the produce of the walnut-trees, toMadeleine that of the chestnuts. The gathering of the nuts began soonafter the vintage,--first the chestnuts, then the walnuts. To beatMadeleine\'s trees with a long pole and hear the nuts fall and rebound onthe dry, matted earth of a chestnut-grove; to see the serious gravity ofthe little girl as she examined the heaps and estimated their probablevalue, which to her represented many pleasures on which she counted;the congratulations of Manette, the trusted servant who alone suppliedMadame de Mortsauf\'s place with the children; the explanations of themother, showing the necessity of labor to obtain all crops, so oftenimperilled by the uncertainties of climate,--all these things made up acharming scene of innocent, childlike happiness amid the fading colorsof the late autumn.Madeleine had a little granary of her own, in which I was to see herbrown treasure garnered and share her delight. Well, I quiver still whenI recall the sound of each basketful of nuts as it was emptied on themass of yellow husks, mixed with earth, which made the floor of thegranary. The count bought what was needed for the household; the farmersand tenants, indeed, every one around Clochegourde, sent buyers to theMignonne, a pet name which the peasantry give even to strangers, butwhich in this case belonged exclusively to Madeleine.Jacques was less fortunate in gathering his walnuts. It rained forseveral days; but I consoled him with the advice to hold back his nutsand sell them a little later. Monsieur de Chessel had told me that thewalnut-trees in the Brehemont, also those about Amboise and Vouvray,were not bearing. Walnut oil is in great demand in Touraine. Jacquesmight get at least forty sous for the product of each tree, and as hehad two hundred the amount was considerable; he intended to spend it onthe equipment of a pony. This wish led to a discussion with his father,who bade him think of the uncertainty of such returns, and the wisdom ofcreating a reserve fund for the years when the trees might not bear,and so equalizing his resources. I felt what was passing through themother\'s mind as she sat by in silence; she rejoiced in the way Jacqueslistened to his father, the father seeming to recover the paternaldignity that was lacking to him, thanks to the ideas which she herselfhad prompted in him. Did I not tell you truly that in picturing thiswoman earthly language was insufficient to render either her characteror her spirit. When such scenes occurred my soul drank in their delightswithout analyzing them; but now, with what vigor they detach themselveson the dark background of my troubled life! Like diamonds they shineagainst the settling of thoughts degraded by alloy, of bitter regretsfor a lost happiness. Why do the names of the two estates purchasedafter the Restoration, and in which Monsieur and Madame de Mortsauf bothtook the deepest interest, the Cassine and the Rhetoriere, move me morethan the sacred names of the Holy Land or of Greece? ""Who loves, knows!""cried La Fontaine. Those names possess the talismanic power of wordsuttered under certain constellations by seers; they explain magic to me;they awaken sleeping forms which arise and speak to me; they lead me tothe happy valley; they recreate skies and landscape. But such evocationsare in the regions of the spiritual world; they pass in the silence ofmy own soul. Be not surprised, therefore, if I dwell on all these homelyscenes; the smallest details of that simple, almost common life areties which, frail as they may seem, bound me in closest union to thecountess.The interests of her children gave Madame de Mortsauf almost as muchanxiety as their health. I soon saw the truth of what she had told me asto her secret share in the management of the family affairs, into whichI became slowly initiated. After ten years\' steady effort Madame deMortsauf had changed the method of cultivating the estate. She had ""putit in fours,"" as the saying is in those parts, meaning the new systemunder which wheat is sown every four years only, so as to make the soilproduce a different crop yearly. To evade the obstinate unwillingness ofthe peasantry it was found necessary to cancel the old leases and givenew ones, to divide the estate into four great farms and let themon equal shares, the sort of lease that prevails in Touraine and itsneighborhood. The owner of the estate gives the house, farm-buildings,and seed-grain to tenants-at-will, with whom he divides the costs ofcultivation and the crops. This division is superintended by an agent orbailiff, whose business it is to take the share belonging to the owner;a costly system, complicated by the market changes of values, whichalter the character of the shares constantly. The countess had inducedMonsieur de Mortsauf to cultivate a fifth farm, made up of the reservedlands about Clochegourde, as much to occupy his mind as to show otherfarmers the excellence of the new method by the evidence of facts. Beingthus, in a hidden way, the mistress of the estate, she had slowlyand with a woman\'s persistency rebuilt two of the farm-houses on theprinciple of those in Artois and Flanders. It is easy to see her motive.She wished, after the expiration of the leases on shares, to relet tointelligent and capable persons for rental in money, and thus simplifythe revenues of Clochegourde. Fearing to die before her husband, shewas anxious to secure for him a regular income, and to her children aproperty which no incapacity could jeopardize. At the present time thefruit-trees planted during the last ten years were in full bearing; thehedges, which secured the boundaries from dispute, were in good order;the elms and poplars were growing well. With the new purchases and thenew farming system well under way, the estate of Clochegourde, dividedinto four great farms, two of which still needed new houses, was capableof bringing in forty thousand francs a year, ten thousand for each farm,not counting the yield of the vineyards, and the two hundred acres ofwoodland which adjoined them, nor the profits of the model home-farm.The roads to the great farms all opened on an avenue which followed astraight line from Clochegourde to the main road leading to Chinon.The distance from the entrance of this avenue to Tours was only fifteenmiles; tenants would never be wanting, especially now that everybody wastalking of the count\'s improvements and the excellent condition of hisland.The countess wished to put some fifteen thousand francs into each ofthe estates lately purchased, and to turn the present dwellings into twolarge farm-houses and buildings, in order that the property might bringin a better rent after the ground had been cultivated for a year or two.These ideas, so simple in themselves, but complicated with the thirtyodd thousand francs it was necessary to expend upon them, were just nowthe topic of many discussions between herself and the count, sometimesamounting to bitter quarrels, in which she was sustained by the thoughtof her children\'s interests. The fear, ""If I die to-morrow what willbecome of them?"" made her heart beat. The gentle, peaceful hearts towhom anger is an impossibility, and whose sole desire is to shed onthose about them their own inward peace, alone know what strength isneeded for such struggles, what demands upon the spirit must be madebefore beginning the contest, what weariness ensues when the fight isover and nothing has been won. At this moment, just as her childrenseemed less anemic, less frail, more active (for the fruit season hadhad its effect on them), and her moist eyes followed them as they playedabout her with a sense of contentment which renewed her strength andrefreshed her heart, the poor woman was called upon to bear the sharpsarcasms and attacks of an angry opposition. The count, alarmed at theplans she proposed, denied with stolid obstinacy the advantages of allshe had done and the possibility of doing more. He replied to conclusivereasoning with the folly of a child who denies the influence of thesun in summer. The countess, however, carried the day. The victoryof commonsense over insanity so healed her wounds that she forgot thebattle. That day we all went to the Cassine and the Rhetoriere, todecide upon the buildings. The count walked alone in front, the childrenwent next, and we ourselves followed slowly, for she was speaking in alow, gentle tone, which made her words like the murmur of the sea as itripples on a smooth beach.She was, she said, certain of success. A new line of communicationbetween Tours and Chinon was to be opened by an active man, a carrier,a cousin of Manette\'s, who wanted a large farm on the route. His familywas numerous; the eldest son would drive the carts, the second couldattend to the business, the father living half-way along the road, atRabelaye, one of the farms then to let, would look after the relays andenrich his land with the manure of the stables. As to the other farm, laBaude, the nearest to Clochegourde, one of their own people, a worthy,intelligent, and industrious man, who saw the advantages of the newsystem of agriculture, was ready to take a lease on it. The Cassine andthe Rhetoriere need give no anxiety; their soil was the very best in theneighborhood; the farm-houses once built, and the ground brought intocultivation, it would be quite enough to advertise them at Tours;tenants would soon apply for them. In two years\' time Clochegourde wouldbe worth at least twenty-four thousand francs a year. Gravelotte,the farm in Maine, which Monsieur de Mortsauf had recovered after theemigration, was rented for seven thousand francs a year for nine years;his pension was four thousand. This income might not be a fortune, butit was certainly a competence. Later, other additions to it might enableher to go to Paris and attend to Jacques\' education; in two years, shethought, his health would be established.With what feeling she uttered the word ""Paris!"" I knew her thought; shewished to be as little separated as possible from her friend. On that Ibroke forth; I told her that she did not know me; that without talkingof it, I had resolved to finish my education by working day and night soas to fit myself to be Jacques\' tutor. She looked grave.""No, Felix,"" she said, ""that cannot be, any more than your priesthood.I thank you from my heart as a mother, but as a woman who loves yousincerely I can never allow you to be the victim of your attachment tome. Such a position would be a social discredit to you, and I could notallow it. No! I cannot be an injury to you in any way. You, Vicomtede Vandenesse, a tutor! You, whose motto is \'Ne se vend!\' Were youRichelieu himself it would bar your way in life; it would give theutmost pain to your family. My friend, you do not know what insult womenof the world, like my mother, can put into a patronizing glance, whatdegradation into a word, what contempt into a bow.""""But if you love me, what is the world to me?""She pretended not to hear, and went on:--""Though my father is most kind and desirous of doing all I ask, he wouldnever forgive your taking so humble a position; he would refuse you hisprotection. I could not consent to your becoming tutor to the Dauphineven. You must accept society as it is; never commit the fault of flyingin the face of it. My friend, this rash proposal of--""""Love,"" I whispered.""No, charity,"" she said, controlling her tears, ""this wild ideaenlightens me as to your character; your heart will be your bane. Ishall claim from this moment the right to teach you certain things.Let my woman\'s eye see for you sometimes. Yes, from the solitudes ofClochegourde I mean to share, silently, contentedly, in your successes.As to a tutor, do not fear; we shall find some good old abbe, somelearned Jesuit, and my father will gladly devote a handsome sum to theeducation of the boy who is to bear his name. Jacques is my pride. Heis, however, eleven years old,"" she added after a pause. ""But it is withhim as with you; when I first saw you I took you to be about thirteen.""We now reached the Cassine, where Jacques, Madeleine, and I followed herabout as children follow a mother; but we were in her way; I left herpresently and went into the orchard where Martineau the elder, keeperof the place, was discussing with Martineau the younger, the bailiff,whether certain trees ought or ought not to be taken down; they werearguing the matter as if it concerned their own property. I then sawhow much the countess was beloved. I spoke of it to a poor laborer, who,with one foot on his spade and an elbow on its handle, stood listeningto the two doctors of pomology.""Ah, yes, monsieur,"" he answered, ""she is a good woman, and not haughtylike those hussies at Azay, who would see us die like dogs sooner thanyield us one penny of the price of a grave! The day when that womanleaves these parts the Blessed Virgin will weep, and we too. She knowswhat is due to her, but she knows our hardships, too, and she puts theminto the account.""With what pleasure I gave that man all the money I had.A few days later a pony arrived for Jacques, his father, an excellenthorseman, wishing to accustom the child by degrees to the fatiguesof such exercise. The boy had a pretty riding-dress, bought withthe product of the nuts. The morning when he took his first lessonaccompanied by his father and by Madeleine, who jumped and shouted aboutthe lawn round which Jacques was riding, was a great maternal festivalfor the countess. The boy wore a blue collar embroidered by her, alittle sky-blue overcoat fastened by a polished leather belt, a pair ofwhite trousers pleated at the waist, and a Scotch cap, from which hisfair hair flowed in heavy locks. He was charming to behold. All theservants clustered round to share the domestic joy. The little heirsmiled at his mother as he passed her, sitting erect, and quitefearless. This first manly act of a child to whom death had often seemedso near, the promise of a sound future warranted by this ride whichshowed him so handsome, so fresh, so rosy,--what a reward for all hercares! Then too the joy of the father, who seemed to renew his youth,and who smiled for the first time in many long months; the pleasureshown on all faces, the shout of an old huntsman of the Lenoncourts, whohad just arrived from Tours, and who, seeing how the boy held the reins,shouted to him, ""Bravo, monsieur le vicomte!""--all this was too much forthe poor mother, and she burst into tears; she, so calm in her griefs,was too weak to bear the joy of admiring her boy as he bounded over thegravel, where so often she had led him in the sunshine inwardly weepinghis expected death. She leaned upon my arm unreservedly, and said: ""Ithink I have never suffered. Do not leave us to-day.""The lesson over, Jacques jumped into his mother\'s arms; she caughthim and held him tightly to her, kissing him passionately. I went withMadeleine to arrange two magnificent bouquets for the dinner-tablein honor of the young equestrian. When we returned to the salon thecountess said: ""The fifteenth of October is certainly a great day withme. Jacques has taken his first riding lesson, and I have just set thelast stitch in my furniture cover.""""Then, Blanche,"" said the count, laughing, ""I must pay you for it.""He offered her his arm and took her to the first courtyard, where stoodan open carriage which her father had sent her, and for which the counthad purchased two English horses. The old huntsman had prepared thesurprise while Jacques was taking his lesson. We got into the carriage,and went to see where the new avenue entered the main road towardsChinon. As we returned, the countess said to me in an anxious tone, ""Iam too happy; to me happiness is like an illness,--it overwhelms me; Ifear it may vanish like a dream.""I loved her too passionately not to feel jealous,--I who could give hernothing! In my rage against myself I longed for some means of dying forher. She asked me to tell her the thoughts that filled my eyes, and Itold her honestly. She was more touched than by all her presents; thentaking me to the portico, she poured comfort into my heart. ""Love me asmy aunt loved me,"" she said, ""and that will be giving me your life; andif I take it, must I not ever be grateful to you?""It was time I finished my tapestry,"" she added as we re-entered thesalon, where I kissed her hand as if to renew my vows. ""Perhaps you donot know, Felix, why I began so formidable a piece of work. Men find theoccupations of life a great resource against troubles; the management ofaffairs distracts their mind; but we poor women have no support withinourselves against our sorrows. To be able to smile before my childrenand my husband when my heart was heavy I felt the need of controlling myinward sufferings by some physical exercise. In this way I escapedthe depression which is apt to follow a great strain upon the moralstrength, and likewise all outbursts of excitement. The mere action oflifting my arm regularly as I drew the stitches rocked my thoughts andgave to my spirit when the tempest raged a monotonous ebb and flowwhich seemed to regulate its emotions. To every stitch I confided mysecrets,--you understand me, do you not? Well, while doing my last chairI have thought much, too much, of you, dear friend. What you have putinto your bouquets I have said in my embroidery.""The dinner was lovely. Jacques, like all children when you take noticeof them, jumped into my arms when he saw the flowers I had arranged forhim as a garland. His mother pretended to be jealous; ah, Natalie, youshould have seen the charming grace with which the dear child offeredthem to her. In the afternoon we played a game of backgammon, I aloneagainst Monsieur and Madame de Mortsauf, and the count was charming.They accompanied me along the road to Frapesle in the twilight of atranquil evening, one of those harmonious evenings when our feelingsgain in depth what they lose in vivacity. It was a day of days inthis poor woman\'s life; a spot of brightness which often comforted herthoughts in painful hours.Soon, however, the riding lessons became a subject of contention. Thecountess justly feared the count\'s harsh reprimands to his son. Jacquesgrew thin, dark circles surrounded his sweet blue eyes; rather thantrouble his mother, he suffered in silence. I advised him to tellhis father he was tired when the count\'s temper was violent; but thatexpedient proved unavailing, and it became necessary to substitutethe old huntsman as a teacher in place of the father, who couldwith difficulty be induced to resign his pupil. Angry reproaches andcontentions began once more; the count found a text for his continualcomplaints in the base ingratitude of women; he flung the carriage,horses, and liveries in his wife\'s face twenty times a day. At last acircumstance occurred on which a man with his nature and his diseasenaturally fastened eagerly. The cost of the buildings at the Cassineand the Rhetoriere proved to be half as much again as the estimate.This news was unfortunately given in the first instance to Monsieur deMortsauf instead of to his wife. It was the ground of a quarrel, whichbegan mildly but grew more and more embittered until it seemed asthough the count\'s madness, lulled for a short time, was demanding itsarrearages from the poor wife.That day I had started from Frapesle at half-past ten to search forflowers with Madeleine. The child had brought the two vases to theportico, and I was wandering about the gardens and adjoining meadowsgathering the autumn flowers, so beautiful, but too rare. Returning frommy final quest, I could not find my little lieutenant with her whitecape and broad pink sash; but I heard cries within the house, andMadeleine presently came running out.""The general,"" she said, crying (the term with her was an expression ofdislike), ""the general is scolding mamma; go and defend her.""I sprang up the steps of the portico and reached the salon without beingseen by either the count or his wife. Hearing the madman\'s sharp criesI first shut all the doors, then I returned and found Henriette as whiteas her dress.""Never marry, Felix,"" said the count as soon as he saw me; ""a woman isled by the devil; the most virtuous of them would invent evil if it didnot exist; they are all vile.""Then followed arguments without beginning or end. Harking back tothe old troubles, Monsieur de Mortsauf repeated the nonsense of thepeasantry against the new system of farming. He declared that if he hadhad the management of Clochegourde he should be twice as rich as he nowwas. He shouted these complaints and insults, he swore, he sprang aroundthe room knocking against the furniture and displacing it; then in themiddle of a sentence he stopped short, complained that his very marrowwas on fire, his brains melting away like his money, his wife had ruinedhim! The countess smiled and looked upward.""Yes, Blanche,"" he cried, ""you are my executioner; you are killing me; Iam in your way; you want to get rid of me; you are monster of hypocrisy.She is smiling! Do you know why she smiles, Felix?""I kept silence and looked down.""That woman,"" he continued, answering his own question, ""denies me allhappiness; she is no more to me than she is to you, and yet she pretendsto be my wife! She bears my name and fulfils none of the duties whichall laws, human and divine, impose upon her; she lies to God and man.She obliges me to go long distances, hoping to wear me out and make meleave her to herself; I am displeasing to her, she hates me; she putsall her art into keeping me away from her; she has made me mad throughthe privations she imposes on me--for everything flies to my poor head;she is killing me by degrees, and she thinks herself a saint and takesthe sacrament every month!""The countess was weeping bitterly, humiliated by the degradation ofthe man, to whom she kept saying for all answer, ""Monsieur! monsieur!monsieur!""Though the count\'s words made me blush, more for him than for Henriette,they stirred my heart violently, for they appealed to the sense ofchastity and delicacy which is indeed the very warp and woof of firstlove.""She is virgin at my expense,"" cried the count.At these words the countess cried out, ""Monsieur!""""What do you mean with your imperious \'Monsieur!\'"" he shouted. ""Am I notyour master? Must I teach you that I am?""He came towards her, thrusting forward his white wolf\'s head, nowhideous, for his yellow eyes had a savage expression which made him looklike a wild beast rushing out of a wood. Henriette slid from her chairto the ground to avoid a blow, which however was not given; she lay atfull length on the floor and lost consciousness, completely exhausted.The count was like a murderer who feels the blood of his victim spurtingin his face; he stopped short, bewildered. I took the poor woman in myarms, and the count let me take her, as though he felt unworthy to touchher; but he went before me to open the door of her bedroom next thesalon,--a sacred room I had never entered. I put the countess on herfeet and held her for a moment in one arm, passing the other round herwaist, while Monsieur de Mortsauf took the eider-down coverlet from thebed; then together we lifted her and laid her, still dressed, on thebed. When she came to herself she motioned to us to unfasten her belt.Monsieur de Mortsauf found a pair of scissors, and cut through it; Imade her breathe salts, and she opened her eyes. The count left theroom, more ashamed than sorry. Two hours passed in perfect silence.Henriette\'s hand lay in mine; she pressed it to mine, but could notspeak. From time to time she opened her eyes as if to tell me by a lookthat she wished to be still and silent; then suddenly, for an instant,there seemed a change; she rose on her elbow and whispered, ""Unhappyman!--ah! if you did but know--""She fell back upon the pillow. The remembrance of her past sufferings,joined to the present shock, threw her again into the nervousconvulsions I had just calmed by the magnetism of love,--a power thenunknown to me, but which I used instinctively. I held her with gentleforce, and she gave me a look which made me weep. When the nervousmotions ceased I smoothed her disordered hair, the first and only timethat I ever touched it; then I again took her hand and sat lookingat the room, all brown and gray, at the bed with its simple chintzcurtains, at the toilet table draped in a fashion now discarded, at thecommonplace sofa with its quilted mattress. What poetry I could readin that room! What renunciations of luxury for herself; the only luxurybeing its spotless cleanliness. Sacred cell of a married nun, filledwith holy resignation; its sole adornments were the crucifix of her bed,and above it the portrait of her aunt; then, on each side of the holywater basin, two drawings of the children made by herself, with locksof their hair when they were little. What a retreat for a woman whoseappearance in the great world of fashion would have made the handsomestof her sex jealous! Such was the chamber where the daughter of anillustrious family wept out her days, sunken at this moment in anguish,and denying herself the love that might have comforted her. Hidden,irreparable woe! Tears of the victim for her slayer, tears of the slayerfor his victim! When the children and waiting-woman came at length intothe room I left it. The count was waiting for me; he seemed to seek meas a mediating power between himself and his wife. He caught my hands,exclaiming, ""Stay, stay with us, Felix!""""Unfortunately,"" I said, ""Monsieur de Chessel has a party, and myabsence would cause remark. But after dinner I will return.""He left the house when I did, and took me to the lower gate withoutspeaking; then he accompanied me to Frapesle, seeming not to know whathe was doing. At last I said to him, ""For heaven\'s sake, Monsieur lecomte, let her manage your affairs if it pleases her, and don\'t tormenther.""""I have not long to live,"" he said gravely; ""she will not suffer longthrough me; my head is giving way.""He left me in a spasm of involuntary self-pity. After dinner I returnedfor news of Madame de Mortsauf, who was already better. If such were thejoys of marriage, if such scenes were frequent, how could she survivethem long? What slow, unpunished murder was this? During that day Iunderstood the tortures by which the count was wearing out his wife.Before what tribunal can we arraign such crimes? These thoughts stunnedme; I could say nothing to Henriette by word of mouth, but I spent thenight in writing to her. Of the three or four letters that I wrote Ihave kept only the beginning of one, with which I was not satisfied.Here it is, for though it seems to me to express nothing, and to speaktoo much of myself when I ought only to have thought of her, it willserve to show you the state my soul was in:--  To Madame de Mortsauf:  How many things I had to say to you when I reached the house! I  thought of them on the way, but I forgot them in your presence.  Yes, when I see you, dear Henriette, I find my thoughts no longer  in keeping with the light from your soul which heightens your  beauty; then, too, the happiness of being near you is so ineffable  as to efface all other feelings. Each time we meet I am born into  a broader life; I am like the traveller who climbs a rock and sees  before him a new horizon. Each time you talk with me I add new  treasures to my treasury. There lies, I think, the secret of long  and inexhaustible affections. I can only speak to you of yourself  when away from you. In your presence I am too dazzled to see, too  happy to question my happiness, too full of you to be myself, too  eloquent through you to speak, too eager in seizing the present  moment to remember the past. You must think of this state of  intoxication and forgive me its consequent mistakes.  When near you I can only feel. Yet, I have courage to say, dear  Henriette, that never, in all the many joys you have given me,  never did I taste such joy as filled my soul when, after that  dreadful storm through which you struggled with superhuman  courage, you came to yourself alone with me, in the twilight of  your chamber where that unhappy scene had brought me. I alone  know the light that shines from a woman when through the portals  of death she re-enters life with the dawn of a rebirth tinting her  brow. What harmonies were in your voice! How words, even your  words, seemed paltry when the sound of that adored voice--in  itself the echo of past pains mingled with divine consolations  --blessed me with the gift of your first thought. I knew you were  brilliant with all human splendor, but yesterday I found a new  Henriette, who might be mine if God so willed; I beheld a spirit  freed from the bodily trammels which repress the ardors of the  soul. Ah! thou wert beautiful indeed in thy weakness, majestic in  thy prostration. Yesterday I found something more beautiful than  thy beauty, sweeter than thy voice; lights more sparkling than the  light of thine eyes, perfumes for which there are no words  --yesterday thy soul was visible and palpable. Would I could have  opened my heart and made thee live there! Yesterday I lost the  respectful timidity with which thy presence inspires me; thy  weakness brought us nearer together. Then, when the crisis passed  and thou couldst bear our atmosphere once more, I knew what it was  to breathe in unison with thy breath. How many prayers rose up to  heaven in that moment! Since I did not die as I rushed through  space to ask of God that he would leave thee with me, no human  creature can die of joy nor yet of sorrow. That moment has left  memories buried in my soul which never again will reappear upon  its surface and leave me tearless. Yes, the fears with which my  soul was tortured yesterday are incomparably greater than all  sorrows that the future can bring upon me, just as the joys which  thou hast given me, dear eternal thought of my life! will be  forever greater than any future joy God may be pleased to grant  me. Thou hast made me comprehend the love divine, that sure love,  sure in strength and in duration, that knows no doubt or jealousy.Deepest melancholy gnawed my soul; the glimpse into that hidden life wasagonizing to a young heart new to social emotions; it was an awful thingto find this abyss at the opening of life,--a bottomless abyss, a DeadSea. This dreadful aggregation of misfortunes suggested many thoughts;at my first step into social life I found a standard of comparison bywhich all other events and circumstances must seem petty.The next day when I entered the salon she was there alone. She looked atme for a moment, held out her hand, and said, ""My friend is always tootender."" Her eyes grew moist; she rose, and then she added, in a tone ofdesperate entreaty, ""Never write thus to me again.""Monsieur de Mortsauf was very kind. The countess had recovered hercourage and serenity; but her pallor betrayed the sufferings of theprevious night, which were calmed, but not extinguished. That eveningshe said to me, as she paced among the autumn leaves which rustledbeneath our footsteps, ""Sorrow is infinite; joys are limited,""--wordswhich betrayed her sufferings by the comparison she made with thefleeting delights of the previous week.""Do not slander life,"" I said to her. ""You are ignorant of love; lovegives happiness which shines in heaven.""""Hush!"" she said. ""I wish to know nothing of it. The Icelander woulddie in Italy. I am calm and happy beside you; I can tell you all mythoughts; do not destroy my confidence. Why will you not combine thevirtue of the priest with the charm of a free man.""""You make me drink the hemlock!"" I cried, taking her hand and laying iton my heart, which was beating fast.""Again!"" she said, withdrawing her hand as if it pained her. ""Are youdetermined to deny me the sad comfort of letting my wounds be stanchedby a friendly hand? Do not add to my sufferings; you do not know themall; those that are hidden are the worst to bear. If you were a womanyou would know the melancholy disgust that fills her soul when shesees herself the object of attentions which atone for nothing, but arethought to atone for all. For the next few days I shall be courted andcaressed, that I may pardon the wrong that has been done. I couldthen obtain consent to any wish of mine, however unreasonable. I amhumiliated by his humility, by caresses which will cease as soon ashe imagines that I have forgotten that scene. To owe our master\'s goodgraces to his faults--""""His crimes!"" I interrupted quickly.""Is not that a frightful condition of existence?"" she continued, with asad smile. ""I cannot use this transient power. At such times I am likethe knights who could not strike a fallen adversary. To see in the dusta man whom we ought to honor, to raise him only to enable him todeal other blows, to suffer from his degradation more than he suffershimself, to feel ourselves degraded if we profit by such influence foreven a useful end, to spend our strength, to waste the vigor of oursouls in struggles that have no grandeur, to have no power except for amoment when a fatal crisis comes--ah, better death! If I had no childrenI would let myself drift on the wretched current of this life; but if Ilose my courage, what will become of them? I must live for them, howevercruel this life may be. You talk to me of love. Ah! my dear friend,think of the hell into which I should fling myself if I gave thatpitiless being, pitiless like all weak creatures, the right to despiseme. The purity of my conduct is my strength. Virtue, dear friend, isholy water in which we gain fresh strength, from which we issue renewedin the love of God.""""Listen to me, dear Henriette; I have only another week to stay here,and I wish--""""Ah, you mean to leave us!"" she exclaimed.""You must know what my father intends to do with me,"" I replied. ""It isnow three months--""""I have not counted the days,"" she said, with momentaryself-abandonment. Then she checked herself and cried, ""Come, let us goto Frapesle.""She called the count and the children, sent for a shawl, and when allwere ready she, usually so calm and slow in all her movements, becameas active as a Parisian, and we started in a body to pay a visit atFrapesle which the countess did not owe. She forced herself to talk toMadame de Chessel, who was fortunately discursive in her answers. Thecount and Monsieur de Chessel conversed on business. I was afraid theformer might boast of his carriage and horses; but he committed no suchsolecisms. His neighbor questioned him about his projected improvementsat the Cassine and the Rhetoriere. I looked at the count, wondering ifhe would avoid a subject of conversation so full of painful memoriesto all, so cruelly mortifying to him. On the contrary, he explained howurgent a duty it was to better the agricultural condition of the canton,to build good houses and make the premises salubrious; in short, heglorified himself with his wife\'s ideas. I blushed as I looked ather. Such want of scruple in a man who, on certain occasions, could bescrupulous enough, this oblivion of the dreadful scene, this adoption ofideas against which he had fought so violently, this confident belief inhimself, petrified me.When Monsieur de Chessel said to him, ""Do you expect to recover youroutlay?""""More than recover it!"" he exclaimed, with a confident gesture.Such contradictions can be explained only by the word ""insanity.""Henriette, celestial creature, was radiant. The count was appearingto be a man of intelligence, a good administrator, an excellentagriculturist; she played with her boy\'s curly head, joyous for him,happy for herself. What a comedy of pain, what mockery in this drama;I was horrified by it. Later in life, when the curtain of the world\'sstage was lifted before me, how many other Mortsaufs I saw without theloyalty and the religious faith of this man. What strange, relentlesspower is it that perpetually awards an angel to a madman; to a man ofheart, of true poetic passion, a base woman; to the petty, grandeur;to this demented brain, a beautiful, sublime being; to Juana, CaptainDiard, whose history at Bordeaux I have told you; to Madame deBeauseant, an Ajuda; to Madame d\'Aiglemont, her husband; to the Marquisd\'Espard, his wife! Long have I sought the meaning of this enigma. Ihave ransacked many mysteries, I have discovered the reason of manynatural laws, the purport of some divine hieroglyphics; of the meaningof this dark secret I know nothing. I study it as I would the form of anIndian weapon, the symbolic construction of which is known only to theBrahmans. In this dread mystery the spirit of Evil is too visibly themaster; I dare not lay the blame to God. Anguish irremediable, whatpower finds amusement in weaving you? Can Henriette and her mysteriousphilosopher be right? Does their mysticism contain the explanation ofhumanity?The autumn leaves were falling during the last few days which I passedin the valley, days of lowering clouds, which do sometimes obscure theheaven of Touraine, so pure, so warm at that fine season. The eveningbefore my departure Madame de Mortsauf took me to the terrace beforedinner.""My dear Felix,"" she said, after we had taken a turn in silence underthe leafless trees, ""you are about to enter the world, and I wish to gowith you in thought. Those who have suffered much have lived and knownmuch. Do not think that solitary souls know nothing of the world; on thecontrary, they are able to judge it. Hear me: If I am to live in andfor my friend I must do what I can for his heart and for his conscience.When the conflict rages it is hard to remember rules; therefore let megive you a few instructions, the warnings of a mother to her son. Theday you leave us I shall give you a letter, a long letter, in which youwill find my woman\'s thoughts on the world, on society, on men, onthe right methods of meeting difficulty in this great clash of humaninterests. Promise me not to read this letter till you reach Paris. Iask it from a fanciful sentiment, one of those secrets of womanhood notimpossible to understand, but which we grieve to find deciphered; leaveme this covert way where as a woman I wish to walk alone.""""Yes, I promise it,"" I said, kissing her hand.""Ah,"" she added, ""I have one more promise to ask of you; but grant itfirst.""""Yes, yes!"" I cried, thinking it was surely a promise of fidelity.""It does not concern myself,"" she said smiling, with some bitterness.""Felix, do not gamble in any house, no matter whose it be; I exceptnone.""""I will never play at all,"" I replied.""Good,"" she said. ""I have found a better use for your time than to wasteit on cards. The end will be that where others must sooner or later belosers you will invariably win.""""How so?""""The letter will tell you,"" she said, with a playful smile, which tookfrom her advice the serious tone which might certainly have been that ofa grandfather.The countess talked to me for an hour, and proved the depth of heraffection by the study she had made of my nature during the last threemonths. She penetrated the recesses of my heart, entering it with herown; the tones of her voice were changeful and convincing; the wordsfell from maternal lips, showing by their tone as well as by theirmeaning how many ties already bound us to each other.""If you knew,"" she said in conclusion, ""with what anxiety I shall followyour course, what joy I shall feel if you walk straight, what tears Imust shed if you strike against the angles! Believe that my affectionhas no equal; it is involuntary and yet deliberate. Ah, I would that Imight see you happy, powerful, respected,--you who are to me a livingdream.""She made me weep, so tender and so terrible was she. Her feelings cameboldly to the surface, yet they were too pure to give the slightest hopeeven to a young man thirsting for pleasure. Ignoring my tortured flesh,she shed the rays, undeviating, incorruptible, of the divine love,which satisfies the soul only. She rose to heights whither the prismaticpinions of a love like mine were powerless to bear me. To reach her aman must needs have won the white wings of the seraphim.""In all that happens to me I will ask myself,"" I said, ""\'What would myHenriette say?\'""""Yes, I will be the star and the sanctuary both,"" she said, alluding tothe dreams of my childhood.""You are my light and my religion,"" I cried; ""you shall be my all.""""No,"" she answered; ""I can never be the source of your pleasures.""She sighed; the smile of secret pain was on her lips, the smile of theslave who momentarily revolts. From that day forth she was to me, notmerely my beloved, but my only love; she was not IN my heart as awoman who takes a place, who makes it hers by devotion or by excessof pleasure given; but she was my heart itself,--it was all hers, asomething necessary to the play of my muscles. She became to me asBeatrice to the Florentine, as the spotless Laura to the Venetian, themother of great thoughts, the secret cause of resolutions which savedme, the support of my future, the light shining in the darkness like alily in a wood. Yes, she inspired those high resolves which pass throughflames, which save the thing in peril; she gave me a constancy likeColigny\'s to vanquish conquerors, to rise above defeat, to weary thestrongest wrestler.The next day, having breakfasted at Frapesle and bade adieu to my kindhosts, I went to Clochegourde. Monsieur and Madame de Mortsauf hadarranged to drive with me to Tours, whence I was to start the same nightfor Paris. During the drive the countess was silent; she pretendedat first to have a headache; then she blushed at the falsehood, andexpiated it by saying that she could not see me go without regret.The count invited me to stay with them whenever, in the absence of theChessels, I might long to see the valley of the Indre once more. Weparted heroically, without apparent tears, but Jacques, who like otherdelicate children was quickly touched, began to cry, while Madeleine,already a woman, pressed her mother\'s hand.""Dear little one!"" said the countess, kissing Jacques passionately.When I was alone at Tours after dinner a wild, inexplicable desire knownonly to young blood possessed me. I hired a horse and rode from Toursto Pont-de-Ruan in an hour and a quarter. There, ashamed of my folly, Idismounted, and went on foot along the road, stepping cautiously likea spy till I reached the terrace. The countess was not there, and Iimagined her ill; I had kept the key of the little gate, by which Inow entered; she was coming down the steps of the portico with the twochildren to breathe in sadly and slowly the tender melancholy of thelandscape, bathed at that moment in the setting sun.""Mother, here is Felix,"" said Madeleine.""Yes,"" I whispered; ""it is I. I asked myself why I should stay at Tourswhile I still could see you; why not indulge a desire that in a few daysmore I could not gratify.""""He won\'t leave us again, mother,"" cried Jacques, jumping round me.""Hush!"" said Madeleine; ""if you make such a noise the general willcome.""""It is not right,"" she said. ""What folly!""The tears in her voice were the payment of what must be called ausurious speculation of love.""I had forgotten to return this key,"" I said smiling.""Then you will never return,"" she said.""Can we ever be really parted?"" I asked, with a look which made her dropher eyelids for all answer.I left her after a few moments passed in that happy stupor of the spiritwhere exaltation ends and ecstasy begins. I went with lagging step,looking back at every minute. When, from the summit of the hill, I sawthe valley for the last time I was struck with the contrast it presentedto what it was when I first came there. Then it was verdant, then itglowed, glowed and blossomed like my hopes and my desires. Initiated nowinto the gloomy secrets of a family, sharing the anguish of a ChristianNiobe, sad with her sadness, my soul darkened, I saw the valley in thetone of my own thoughts. The fields were bare, the leaves of the poplarsfalling, the few that remained were rusty, the vine-stalks were burned,the tops of the trees were tan-colored, like the robes in which royaltyonce clothed itself as if to hide the purple of its power beneath thebrown of grief. Still in harmony with my thoughts, the valley, where theyellow rays of the setting sun were coldly dying, seemed to me a livingimage of my heart.To leave a beloved woman is terrible or natural, according as the mindtakes it. For my part, I found myself suddenly in a strange land ofwhich I knew not the language. I was unable to lay hold of things towhich my soul no longer felt attachment. Then it was that the heightand the breadth of my love came before me; my Henriette rose in all hermajesty in this desert where I existed only through thoughts of her.That form so worshipped made me vow to keep myself spotless before mysoul\'s divinity, to wear ideally the white robe of the Levite, likePetrarch, who never entered Laura\'s presence unless clothed in white.With what impatience I awaited the first night of my return to myfather\'s roof, when I could read the letter which I felt of during thejourney as a miser fingers the bank-bills he carries about him. Duringthe night I kissed the paper on which my Henriette had manifested herwill; I sought to gather the mysterious emanations of her hand, torecover the intonations of her voice in the hush of my being. Since thenI have never read her letters except as I read that first letter; inbed, amid total silence. I cannot understand how the letters of ourbeloved can be read in any other way; yet there are men, unworthy tobe loved, who read such letters in the turmoil of the day, laying themaside and taking them up again with odious composure.Here, Natalie, is the voice which echoed through the silence of thatnight. Behold the noble figure which stood before me and pointed to theright path among the cross-ways at which I stood.  To Monsieur le Vicomte Felix de Vandenesse:  What happiness for me, dear friend, to gather the scattered  elements of my experience that I may arm you against the dangers  of the world, through which I pray that you pass scatheless. I  have felt the highest pleasures of maternal love as night after  night I have thought of these things. While writing this letter,  sentence by sentence, projecting my thoughts into the life you are  about to lead, I went often to my window. Looking at the towers of  Frapesle, visible in the moonlight, I said to myself, ""He sleeps,  I wake for him."" Delightful feelings! which recall the happiest of  my life, when I watched Jacques sleeping in his cradle and waited  till he wakened, to feed him with my milk. You are the man-child  whose soul must now be strengthened by precepts never taught in  schools, but which we women have the privilege of inculcating.  These precepts will influence your success; they prepare the way  for it, they will secure it. Am I not exercising a spiritual  motherhood in giving you a standard by which to judge the actions  of your life; a motherhood comprehended, is it not, by the child?  Dear Felix, let me, even though I may make a few mistakes, let me  give to our friendship a proof of the disinterestedness which  sanctifies it.  In yielding you to the world I am renouncing you; but I love you  too well not to sacrifice my happiness to your welfare. For the  last four months you have made me reflect deeply on the laws and  customs which regulate our epoch. The conversations I have had  with my aunt, well-known to you who have replaced her, the events  of Monsieur de Mortsauf\'s life, which he has told me, the tales  related by my father, to whom society and the court are familiar  in their greatest as well as in their smallest aspects, all these  have risen in my memory for the benefit of my adopted child at the  moment when he is about to be launched, well-nigh alone, among  men; about to act without adviser in a world where many are  wrecked by their own best qualities thoughtlessly displayed, while  others succeed through a judicious use of their worst.  I ask you to ponder this statement of my opinion of society as a  whole; it is concise, for to you a few words are sufficient.  I do not know whether societies are of divine origin or whether  they were invented by man. I am equally ignorant of the direction  in which they tend. What I do know certainly is the fact of their  existence. No sooner therefore do you enter society, instead of  living a life apart, than you are bound to consider its conditions  binding; a contract is signed between you. Does society in these  days gain more from a man than it returns to him? I think so; but  as to whether the individual man finds more cost than profit, or  buys too dear the advantages he obtains, concerns the legislator  only; I have nothing to say to that. In my judgment you are bound  to obey in all things the general law, without discussion, whether  it injures or benefits your personal interests. This principle may  seem to you a very simple one, but it is difficult of application;  it is like sap, which must infiltrate the smallest of the  capillary tubes to stir the tree, renew its verdure, develop its  flowers, and ripen fruit. Dear, the laws of society are not all  written in a book; manners and customs create laws, the more  important of which are often the least known. Believe me, there  are neither teachers, nor schools, nor text-books for the laws  that are now to regulate your actions, your language, your visible  life, the manner of your presentation to the world, and your quest  of fortune. Neglect those secret laws or fail to understand them,  and you stay at the foot of the social system instead of looking  down upon it. Even though this letter may seem to you diffuse,  telling you much that you have already thought, let me confide to  you a woman\'s ethics.  To explain society on the theory of individual happiness adroitly  won at the cost of the greater number is a monstrous doctrine,  which in its strict application leads men to believe that all they  can secretly lay hold of before the law or society or other  individuals condemn it as a wrong is honestly and fairly theirs.  Once admit that claim and the clever thief goes free; the woman  who violates her marriage vow without the knowledge of the world  is virtuous and happy; kill a man, leaving no proof for justice,  and if, like Macbeth, you win a crown you have done wisely; your  selfish interests become the higher law; the only question then is  how to evade, without witnesses or proof, the obstacles which law  and morality place between you and your self-indulgence. To those  who hold this view of society, the problem of making their  fortune, my dear friend, resolves itself into playing a game where  the stakes are millions or the galleys, political triumphs or  dishonor. Still, the green cloth is not long enough for all the  players, and a certain kind of genius is required to play the  game. I say nothing of religious beliefs, nor yet of feelings;  what concerns us now is the running-gear of the great machine of  gold and iron, and its practical results with which men\'s lives  are occupied. Dear child of my heart, if you share my horror at  this criminal theory of the world, society will present to your  mind, as it does to all sane minds, the opposite theory of duty.  Yes, you will see that man owes himself to man in a thousand  differing ways. To my mind, the duke and peer owe far more to the  workman and the pauper than the pauper and the workman owe to the  duke. The obligations of duty enlarge in proportion to the  benefits which society bestows on men; in accordance with the  maxim, as true in social politics as in business, that the burden  of care and vigilance is everywhere in proportion to profits. Each  man pays his debt in his own way. When our poor toiler at the  Rhetoriere comes home weary with his day\'s work has he not done  his duty? Assuredly he has done it better than many in the ranks  above him.  If you take this view of society, in which you are about to seek a  place in keeping with your intellect and your faculties, you must  set before you as a generating principle and mainspring, this  maxim: never permit yourself to act against either your own  conscience or the public conscience. Though my entreaty may seem  to you superfluous, yet I entreat, yes, your Henriette implores  you to ponder the meaning of that rule. It seems simple but, dear,  it means that integrity, loyalty, honor, and courtesy are the  safest and surest instruments for your success. In this selfish  world you will find many to tell you that a man cannot make his  way by sentiments, that too much respect for moral considerations  will hinder his advance. It is not so; you will see men  ill-trained, ill-taught, incapable of measuring the future, who are  rough to a child, rude to an old woman, unwilling to be irked by  some worthy old man on the ground that they can do nothing for  him; later, you will find the same men caught by the thorns which  they might have rendered pointless, and missing their triumph for  some trivial reason; whereas the man who is early trained to a  sense of duty does not meet the same obstacles; he may attain  success less rapidly, but when attained it is solid and does not  crumble like that of others.  When I show you that the application of this doctrine demands in  the first place a mastery of the science of manners, you may think  my jurisprudence has a flavor of the court and of the training I  received as a Lenoncourt. My dear friend, I do attach great  importance to that training, trifling as it seems. You will find  that the habits of the great world are as important to you as the  wide and varied knowledge that you possess. Often they take the  place of such knowledge; for some really ignorant men, born with  natural gifts and accustomed to give connection to their ideas,  have been known to attain a grandeur never reached by others far  more worthy of it. I have studied you thoroughly, Felix, wishing  to know if your education, derived wholly from schools, has  injured your nature. God knows the joy with which I find you fit  for that further education of which I speak.  The manners of many who are brought up in the traditions of the  great world are purely external; true politeness, perfect manners,  come from the heart, and from a deep sense of personal dignity.  This is why some men of noble birth are, in spite of their  training, ill-mannered, while others, among the middle classes,  have instinctive good taste and only need a few lessons to give  them excellent manners without any signs of awkward imitation.  Believe a poor woman who no longer leaves her valley when she  tells you that this dignity of tone, this courteous simplicity in  words, in gesture, in bearing, and even in the character of the  home, is a living and material poem, the charm of which is  irresistible; imagine therefore what it is when it takes its  inspiration from the heart. Politeness, dear, consists in seeming  to forget ourselves for others; with many it is social cant, laid  aside when personal self-interest shows its cloven-foot; a noble  then becomes ignoble. But--and this is what I want you to  practise, Felix--true politeness involves a Christian principle;  it is the flower of Love, it requires that we forget ourselves  really. In memory of your Henriette, for her sake, be not a  fountain without water, have the essence and the form of true  courtesy. Never fear to be the dupe and victim of this social  virtue; you will some day gather the fruit of seeds scattered  apparently to the winds.  My father used to say that one of the great offences of sham  politeness was the neglect of promises. When anything is demanded  of you that you cannot do, refuse positively and leave no  loopholes for false hopes; on the other hand, grant at once  whatever you are willing to bestow. Your prompt refusal will make  you friends as well as your prompt benefit, and your character  will stand the higher; for it is hard to say whether a promise  forgotten, a hope deceived does not make us more enemies than a  favor granted brings us friends.  Dear friend, there are certain little matters on which I may  dwell, for I know them, and it comes within my province to impart  them. Be not too confiding, nor frivolous, nor over enthusiastic,  --three rocks on which youth often strikes. Too confiding a nature  loses respect, frivolity brings contempt, and others take  advantage of excessive enthusiasm. In the first place, Felix, you  will never have more than two or three friends in the course of  your life. Your entire confidence is their right; to give it to  many is to betray your real friends. If you are more intimate with  some men than with others keep guard over yourself; be as cautious  as though you knew they would one day be your rivals, or your  enemies; the chances and changes of life require this. Maintain an  attitude which is neither cold nor hot; find the medium point at  which a man can safely hold intercourse with others without  compromising himself. Yes, believe me, the honest man is as far  from the base cowardice of Philinte as he is from the harsh virtue  of Alceste. The genius of the poet is displayed in the mind of  this true medium; certainly all minds do enjoy more the ridicule  of virtue than the sovereign contempt of easy-going selfishness  which underlies that picture of it; but all, nevertheless, are  prompted to keep themselves from either extreme.  As to frivolity, if it causes fools to proclaim you a charming  man, others who are accustomed to judge of men\'s capacities and  fathom character, will winnow out your tare and bring you to  disrepute, for frivolity is the resource of weak natures, and  weakness is soon appraised in a society which regards its members  as nothing more than organs--and perhaps justly, for nature  herself puts to death imperfect beings. A woman\'s protecting  instincts may be roused by the pleasure she feels in supporting  the weak against the strong, and in leading the intelligence of  the heart to victory over the brutality of matter; but society,  less a mother than a stepmother, adores only the children who  flatter her vanity.  As to ardent enthusiasm, that first sublime mistake of youth,  which finds true happiness in using its powers, and begins by  being its own dupe before it is the dupe of others, keep it within  the region of the heart\'s communion, keep it for woman and for  God. Do not hawk its treasures in the bazaars of society or of  politics, where trumpery will be offered in exchange for them.  Believe the voice which commands you to be noble in all things  when it also prays you not to expend your forces uselessly.  Unhappily, men will rate you according to your usefulness, and not  according to your worth. To use an image which I think will strike  your poetic mind, let a cipher be what it may, immeasurable in  size, written in gold, or written in pencil, it is only a cipher  after all. A man of our times has said, ""No zeal, above all, no  zeal!"" The lesson may be sad, but it is true, and it saves the  soul from wasting its bloom. Hide your pure sentiments, or put  them in regions inaccessible, where their blossoms may be  passionately admired, where the artist may dream amorously of his  master-piece. But duties, my friend, are not sentiments. To do  what we ought is by no means to do what we like. A man who would  give his life enthusiastically for a woman must be ready to die  coldly for his country.  One of the most important rules in the science of manners is that  of almost absolute silence about ourselves. Play a little comedy  for your own instruction; talk of yourself to acquaintances, tell  them about your sufferings, your pleasures, your business, and you  will see how indifference succeeds pretended interest; then  annoyance follows, and if the mistress of the house does not find  some civil way of stopping you the company will disappear under  various pretexts adroitly seized. Would you, on the other hand,  gather sympathies about you and be spoken of as amiable and witty,  and a true friend? talk to others of themselves, find a way to  bring them forward, and brows will clear, lips will smile, and  after you leave the room all present will praise you. Your  conscience and the voice of your own heart will show you the line  where the cowardice of flattery begins and the courtesy of  intercourse ceases.  One word more about a young man\'s demeanor in public. My dear  friend, youth is always inclined to a rapidity of judgment which  does it honor, but also injury. This was why the old system of  education obliged young people to keep silence and study life in a  probationary period beside their elders. Formerly, as you know,  nobility, like art, had its apprentices, its pages, devoted body  and soul to the masters who maintained them. To-day youth is  forced in a hot-house; it is trained to judge of thoughts,  actions, and writings with biting severity; it slashes with a  blade that has not been fleshed. Do not make this mistake. Such  judgments will seem like censures to many about you, who would  sooner pardon an open rebuke than a secret wound. Young people are  pitiless because they know nothing of life and its difficulties.  The old critic is kind and considerate, the young critic is  implacable; the one knows nothing, the other knows all. Moreover,  at the bottom of all human actions there is a labyrinth of  determining reasons on which God reserves for himself the final  judgment. Be severe therefore to none but yourself.  Your future is before you; but no one in the world can make his  way unaided. Therefore, make use of my father\'s house; its doors  are open to you; the connections that you will create for yourself  under his roof will serve you in a hundred ways. But do not yield  an inch of ground to my mother; she will crush any one who gives  up to her, but she will admire the courage of whoever resists her.  She is like iron, which if beaten, can be fused with iron, but  when cold will break everything less hard than itself. Cultivate  my mother; for if she thinks well of you she will introduce you  into certain houses where you can acquire the fatal science of the  world, the art of listening, speaking, answering, presenting  yourself to the company and taking leave of it; the precise use of  language, the something--how shall I explain it?--which is no more  superiority than the coat is the man, but without which the  highest talent in the world will never be admitted within those  portals.  I know you well enough to be quite sure I indulge no illusion when  I imagine that I see you as I wish you to be; simple in manners,  gentle in tone, proud without conceit, respectful to the old,  courteous without servility, above all, discreet. Use your wit but  never display it for the amusement of others; for be sure that if  your brilliancy annoys an inferior man, he will retire from the  field and say of you in a tone of contempt, ""He is very amusing.""  Let your superiority be leonine. Moreover, do not be always  seeking to please others. I advise a certain coldness in your  relations with men, which may even amount to indifference; this  will not anger others, for all persons esteem those who slight  them; and it will win you the favor of women, who will respect you  for the little consequence that you attach to men. Never remain in  company with those who have lost their reputation, even though  they may not have deserved to do so; for society holds us  responsible for our friendships as well as for our enmities. In  this matter let your judgments be slowly and maturely weighed, but  see that they are irrevocable. When the men whom you have repulsed  justify the repulsion, your esteem and regard will be all the more  sought after; you have inspired the tacit respect which raises a  man among his peers. I behold you now armed with a youth that  pleases, grace which attracts, and wisdom with which to preserve  your conquests. All that I have now told you can be summed up in  two words, two old-fashioned words, ""Noblesse oblige.""  Now apply these precepts to the management of life. You will hear  many persons say that strategy is the chief element of success;  that the best way to press through the crowd is to set some men  against other men and so take their places. That was a good system  for the Middle Ages, when princes had to destroy their rivals by  pitting one against the other; but in these days, all things being  done in open day, I am afraid it would do you ill-service. No, you  must meet your competitors face to face, be they loyal and true  men, or traitorous enemies whose weapons are calumny,  evil-speaking, and fraud. But remember this, you have no more  powerful auxiliaries than these men themselves; they are their own  enemies; fight them with honest weapons, and sooner or later they  are condemned. As to the first of them, loyal men and true, your  straightforwardness will obtain their respect, and the differences  between you once settled (for all things can be settled), these  men will serve you. Do not be afraid of making enemies; woe to him  who has none in the world you are about to enter; but try to give  no handle for ridicule or disparagement. I say _try_, for in Paris a  man cannot always belong solely to himself; he is sometimes at the  mercy of circumstances; you will not always be able to avoid the  mud in the gutter nor the tile that falls from the roof. The moral  world has gutters where persons of no reputation endeavor to  splash the mud in which they live upon men of honor. But you can  always compel respect by showing that you are, under all  circumstances, immovable in your principles. In the conflict of  opinions, in the midst of quarrels and cross-purposes, go straight  to the point, keep resolutely to the question; never fight except  for the essential thing, and put your whole strength into that.  You know how Monsieur de Mortsauf hates Napoleon, how he curses  him and pursues him as justice does a criminal; demanding  punishment day and night for the death of the Duc d\'Enghien, the  only death, the only misfortune, that ever brought the tears to  his eyes; well, he nevertheless admired him as the greatest of  captains, and has often explained to me his strategy. May not the  same tactics be applied to the war of human interests; they would  economize time as heretofore they economized men and space. Think  this over, for as a woman I am liable to be mistaken on such  points which my sex judges only by instinct and sentiment. One  point, however, I may insist on; all trickery, all deception, is  certain to be discovered and to result in doing harm; whereas  every situation presents less danger if a man plants himself  firmly on his own truthfulness. If I may cite my own case, I can  tell you that, obliged as I am by Monsieur de Mortsauf\'s condition  to avoid litigation and to bring to an immediate settlement all  difficulties which arise in the management of Clochegourde, and  which would otherwise cause him an excitement under which his mind  would succumb, I have invariably settled matters promptly by  taking hold of the knot of the difficulty and saying to our  opponents: ""We will either untie it or cut it!""  It will often happen that you do a service to others and find  yourself ill-rewarded; I beg you not to imitate those who complain  of men and declare them to be all ungrateful. That is putting  themselves on a pedestal indeed! and surely it is somewhat silly  to admit their lack of knowledge of the world. But you, I trust,  will not do good as a usurer lends his money; you will do it--will  you not?--for good\'s sake. Noblesse oblige. Nevertheless, do not  bestow such services as to force others to ingratitude, for if you  do, they will become your most implacable enemies; obligations  sometimes lead to despair, like the despair of ruin itself, which  is capable of very desperate efforts. As for yourself, accept as  little as you can from others. Be no man\'s vassal; and bring  yourself out of your own difficulties.  You see, dear friend, I am advising you only on the lesser points  of life. In the world of politics things wear a different aspect;  the rules which are to guide your individual steps give way before  the national interests. If you reach that sphere where great men  revolve you will be, like God himself, the sole arbiter of your  determinations. You will no longer be a man, but law, the living  law; no longer an individual, you are then the Nation incarnate.  But remember this, though you judge, you will yourself be judged;  hereafter you will be summoned before the ages, and you know  history well enough to be fully informed as to what deeds and what  sentiments have led to true grandeur.  I now come to a serious matter, your conduct towards women.  Wherever you visit make it a principle not to fritter yourself  away in a petty round of gallantry. A man of the last century who  had great social success never paid attention to more than one  woman of an evening, choosing the one who seemed the most  neglected. That man, my dear child, controlled his epoch. He  wisely reckoned that by a given time all women would speak well of  him. Many young men waste their most precious possession, namely,  the time necessary to create connections which contribute more  than all else to social success. Your springtime is short,  endeavor to make the most of it. Cultivate influential women.  Influential women are old women; they will teach you the  intermarriages and the secrets of all the families of the great  world; they will show you the cross-roads which will bring you  soonest to your goal. They will be fond of you. The bestowal of  protection is their last form of love--when they are not devout.  They will do you innumerable good services; sing your praises and  make you desirable to society. Avoid young women. Do not think I  say this from personal self-interest. The woman of fifty will do  all for you, the woman of twenty will do nothing; she wants your  whole life while the other asks only a few attentions. Laugh with  the young women, meet them for pastime merely; they are incapable  of serious thought. Young women, dear friend, are selfish, vain,  petty, ignorant of true friendship; they love no one but  themselves; they would sacrifice you to an evening\'s success.  Besides, they all want absolute devotion, and your present  situation requires that devotion be shown to you; two  irreconcilable needs! None of these young women would enter into  your interests; they would think of themselves and not of you;  they would injure you more by their emptiness and frivolity than  they could serve you by their love; they will waste your time  unscrupulously, hinder your advance to fortune, and end by  destroying your future with the best grace possible. If you  complain, the silliest of them will make you think that her glove  is more precious than fortune, and that nothing is so glorious as  to be her slave. They will all tell you that they bestow  happiness, and thus lull you to forget your nobler destiny.  Believe me, the happiness they give is transitory; your great  career will endure. You know not with what perfidious cleverness  they contrive to satisfy their caprices, nor the art with which  they will convert your passing fancy into a love which ought to be  eternal. The day when they abandon you they will tell you that the  words, ""I no longer love you,"" are a full justification of their  conduct, just as the words, ""I love,"" justified their winning you;  they will declare that love is involuntary and not to be coerced.  Absurd! Believe me, dear, true love is eternal, infinite, always  like unto itself; it is equable, pure, without violent  demonstration; white hair often covers the head but the heart that  holds it is ever young. No such love is found among the women of  the world; all are playing comedy; this one will interest you by  her misfortunes; she seems the gentlest and least exacting of her  sex, but when once she is necessary to you, you will feel the  tyranny of weakness and will do her will; you may wish to be a  diplomat, to go and come, and study men and interests,--no, you  must stay in Paris, or at her country-place, sewn to her  petticoat, and the more devotion you show the more ungrateful and  exacting she will be. Another will attract you by her  submissiveness; she will be your attendant, follow you  romantically about, compromise herself to keep you, and be the  millstone about your neck. You will drown yourself some day, but  the woman will come to the surface.  The least manoeuvring of these women of the world have many nets.  The silliest triumph because too foolish to excite distrust. The  one to be feared least may be the woman of gallantry whom you love  without exactly knowing why; she will leave you for no motive and  go back to you out of vanity. All these women will injure you,  either in the present or the future. Every young woman who enters  society and lives a life of pleasure and of gratified vanity is  semi-corrupt and will corrupt you. Among them you will not find  the chaste and tranquil being in whom you may forever reign. Ah!  she who loves you will love solitude; the festivals of her heart  will be your glances; she will live upon your words. May she be  all the world to you, for you will be all in all to her. Love her  well; give her neither griefs nor rivals; do not rouse her  jealousy. To be loved, dear, to be comprehended, is the greatest  of all joys; I pray that you may taste it! But run no risk of  injuring the flower of your soul; be sure, be very sure of the  heart in which you place your affections. That woman will never be  her own self; she will never think of herself, but of you. She  will never oppose you, she will have no interests of her own; for  you she will see a danger where you can see none and where she  would be oblivious of her own. If she suffers it will be in  silence; she will have no personal vanity, but deep reverence for  whatever in her has won your love. Respond to such a love by  surpassing it. If you are fortunate enough to find that which I,  your poor friend, must ever be without, I mean a love mutually  inspired, mutually felt, remember that in a valley lives a mother  whose heart is so filled with the feelings you have put there that  you can never sound its depths. Yes, I bear you an affection which  you will never know to its full extent; before it could show  itself for what it is you would have to lose your mind and  intellect, and then you would be unable to comprehend the length  and breadth of my devotion.  Shall I be misunderstood in bidding you avoid young women (all  more or less artful, satirical, vain, frivolous, and extravagant)  and attach yourself to influential women, to those imposing  dowagers full of excellent good-sense, like my aunt, who will help  your career, defend you from attacks, and say for you the things  that you cannot say for yourself? Am I not, on the contrary,  generous in bidding you reserve your love for the coming angel  with the guileless heart? If the motto Noblesse oblige sums up the  advice I gave you just now, my further advice on your relations to  women is based upon that other motto of chivalry, ""Serve all, love  one!""  Your educational knowledge is immense; your heart, saved by early  suffering, is without a stain; all is noble, all is well with you.  Now, Felix, WILL! Your future lies in that one word, that word of  great men. My child, you will obey your Henriette, will you not?  You will permit her to tell you from time to time the thoughts  that are in her mind of you and of your relations to the world? I  have an eye in my soul which sees the future for you as for my  children; suffer me to use that faculty for your benefit; it is a  faculty, a mysterious gift bestowed by my lonely life; far from  its growing weaker, I find it strengthened and exalted by solitude  and silence.  I ask you in return to bestow a happiness on me; I desire to see  you becoming more and more important among men, without one single  success that shall bring a line of shame upon my brow; I desire  that you may quickly bring your fortunes to the level of your  noble name, and be able to tell me I have contributed to your  advancement by something better than a wish. This secret  co-operation in your future is the only pleasure I can allow  myself. For it, I will wait and hope.  I do not say farewell. We are separated; you cannot put my hand to  your lips, but you must surely know the place you hold in the  heart of yourHenriette.As I read this letter I felt the maternal heart beating beneath myfingers which held the paper while I was still cold from the harshgreeting of my own mother. I understood why the countess had forbiddenme to open it in Touraine; no doubt she feared that I would fall at herfeet and wet them with my tears.I now made the acquaintance of my brother Charles, who up to thistime had been a stranger to me. But in all our intercourse he showeda haughtiness which kept us apart and prevented brotherly affection.Kindly feelings depend on similarity of soul, and there was no point oftouch between us. He preached to me dogmatically those social trifleswhich head or heart can see without instruction; he seemed to mistrustme. If I had not had the inward support of my great love he would havemade me awkward and stupid by affecting to believe that I knew nothingof life. He presented me in society under the expectation that mydulness would be a foil to his qualities. Had I not remembered thesorrows of my childhood I might have taken his protecting vanity forbrotherly affection; but inward solitude produces the same effectsas outward solitude; silence within our souls enables us to hear thefaintest sound; the habit of taking refuge within ourselves developsa perception which discerns every quality of the affections about us.Before I knew Madame de Mortsauf a hard look grieved me, a rough wordwounded me to the heart; I bewailed these things without as yet knowinganything of a life of tenderness; whereas now, since my return fromClochegourde, I could make comparisons which perfected my instinctiveperceptions. All deductions derived only from sufferings endured areincomplete. Happiness has a light to cast. I now allowed myself the morewillingly to be kept under the heel of primogeniture because I was notmy brother\'s dupe.I always went alone to the Duchesse de Lenoncourt\'s, where Henriette\'sname was never mentioned; no one, except the good old duke, who wassimplicity itself, ever spoke of her to me; but by the way he welcomedme I guessed that his daughter had privately commended me to his care.At the moment when I was beginning to overcome the foolish wonder andshyness which besets a young man at his first entrance into the greatworld, and to realize the pleasures it could give through the resourcesit offers to ambition, just, too, as I was beginning to make use ofHenriette\'s maxims, admiring their wisdom, the events of the 20th ofMarch took place.My brother followed the court to Ghent; I, by Henriette\'s advice (for Ikept up a correspondence with her, active on my side only), went therealso with the Duc de Lenoncourt. The natural kindness of the old duketurned to a hearty and sincere protection as soon as he saw me attached,body and soul, to the Bourbons. He himself presented me to his Majesty.Courtiers are not numerous when misfortunes are rife; but youth isgifted with ingenuous admiration and uncalculating fidelity. The kinghad the faculty of judging men; a devotion which might have passedunobserved in Paris counted for much at Ghent, and I had the happinessof pleasing Louis XVIII.A letter from Madame de Mortsauf to her father, brought with despatchesby an emissary of the Vendeens, enclosed a note to me by which I learnedthat Jacques was ill. Monsieur de Mortsauf, in despair at his son\'sill-health, and also at the news of a second emigration, added a fewwords which enabled me to guess the situation of my dear one. Worried byhim, no doubt, when she passed all her time at Jacques\' bedside, allowedno rest either day or night, superior to annoyance, yet unable always tocontrol herself when her whole soul was given to the care of her child,Henriette needed the support of a friendship which might lighten theburden of her life, were it only by diverting her husband\'s mind. ThoughI was now most impatient to rival the career of my brother, who hadlately been sent to the Congress of Vienna, and was anxious at any riskto justify Henriette\'s appeal and become a man myself, freed from allvassalage, nevertheless my ambition, my desire for independence, thegreat interest I had in not leaving the king, all were of no accountbefore the vision of Madame de Mortsauf\'s sad face. I resolved to leavethe court at Ghent and serve my true sovereign. God rewarded me. Theemissary sent by the Vendeens was unable to return. The king wanted amessenger who would faithfully carry back his instructions. The Duc deLenoncourt knew that the king would never forget the man who undertookso perilous an enterprise; he asked for the mission without consultingme, and I gladly accepted it, happy indeed to be able to return toClochegourde employed in the good cause.After an audience with the king I returned to France, where, both inParis and in Vendee, I was fortunate enough to carry out his Majesty\'sinstructions. Towards the end of May, being tracked by the Bonapartistauthorities to whom I was denounced, I was obliged to fly from place toplace in the character of a man endeavoring to get back to his estate.I went on foot from park to park, from wood to wood, across the wholeof upper Vendee, the Bocage and Poitou, changing my direction as dangerthreatened.I reached Saumur, from Saumur I went to Chinon, and from Chinon Ireached, in a single night, the woods of Nueil, where I met the count onhorseback; he took me up behind him and we reached Clochegourde withoutpassing any one who recognized me.""Jacques is better,"" were the first words he said to me.I explained to him my position of diplomatic postman, hunted like a wildbeast, and the brave gentleman in his quality of royalist claimed thedanger over Chessel of receiving me. As we came in sight of Clochegourdethe past eight months rolled away like a dream. When we entered thesalon the count said: ""Guess whom I bring you?--Felix!""""Is it possible!"" she said, with pendant arms and a bewildered face.I showed myself and we both remained motionless; she in her armchair, Ion the threshold of the door; looking at each other with that hungerof the soul which endeavors to make up in a single glance for the lostmonths. Then, recovering from a surprise which left her heart unveiled,she rose and I went up to her.""I have prayed for your safety,"" she said, giving me her hand to kiss.She asked news of her father; then she guessed my weariness and wentto prepare my room, while the count gave me something to eat, for I wasdying of hunger. My room was the one above hers, her aunt\'s room; sherequested the count to take me there, after setting her foot on thefirst step of the staircase, deliberating no doubt whether to accompanyme; I turned my head, she blushed, bade me sleep well, and went away.When I came down to dinner I heard for the first time of the disastersat Waterloo, the flight of Napoleon, the march of the Allies to Paris,and the probable return of the Bourbons. These events were all in all tothe count; to us they were nothing. What think you was the great eventI was to learn, after kissing the children?--for I will not dwell on thealarm I felt at seeing the countess pale and shrunken; I knew the injuryI might do by showing it and was careful to express only joy at seeingher. But the great event for us was told in the words, ""You shall haveice to-day!"" She had often fretted the year before that the water wasnot cold enough for me, who, never drinking anything else, liked iticed. God knows how many entreaties it had cost her to get an ice-housebuilt. You know better than any one that a word, a look, an inflectionof the voice, a trifling attention, suffices for love; love\'s noblestprivilege is to prove itself by love. Well, her words, her look, herpleasure, showed me her feelings, as I had formerly shown her mine bythat first game of backgammon. These ingenuous proofs of her affectionwere many; on the seventh day after my arrival she recovered herfreshness, she sparkled with health and youth and happiness; my lilyexpanded in beauty just as the treasures of my heart increased. Only inpetty minds or in common hearts can absence lessen love or efface thefeatures or diminish the beauty of our dear one. To ardent imaginations,to all beings through whose veins enthusiasm passes like a crimson tide,and in whom passion takes the form of constancy, absence has the sameeffect as the sufferings of the early Christians, which strengthenedtheir faith and made God visible to them. In hearts that abound in loveare there not incessant longings for a desired object, to which theglowing fire of our dreams gives higher value and a deeper tint? Arewe not conscious of instigations which give to the beloved features thebeauty of the ideal by inspiring them with thought? The past, dwelt onin all its details becomes magnified; the future teems with hope. Whentwo hearts filled with these electric clouds meet each other, theirinterview is like the welcome storm which revives the earth andstimulates it with the swift lightnings of the thunderbolt. How manytender pleasures came to me when I found these thoughts and thesesensations reciprocal! With what glad eyes I followed the developmentof happiness in Henriette! A woman who renews her life from that of herbeloved gives, perhaps, a greater proof of feeling than she who dieskilled by a doubt, withered on her stock for want of sap; I know notwhich of the two is the more touching.The revival of Madame de Mortsauf was wholly natural, like the effectsof the month of May upon the meadows, or those of the sun and of thebrook upon the drooping flowers. Henriette, like our dear valley oflove, had had her winter; she revived like the valley in the springtime.Before dinner we went down to the beloved terrace. There, with one handstroking the head of her son, who walked feebly beside her, silent, asthough he were breeding an illness, she told me of her nights beside hispillow.For three months, she said, she had lived wholly within herself,inhabiting, as it were, a dark palace; afraid to enter sumptuous roomswhere the light shone, where festivals were given, to her denied, at thedoor of which she stood, one glance turned upon her child, another toa dim and distant figure; one ear listening for moans, another for avoice. She told me poems, born of solitude, such as no poet eversang; but all ingenuously, without one vestige of love, one trace ofvoluptuous thought, one echo of a poesy orientally soothing as the roseof Frangistan. When the count joined us she continued in the same tone,like a woman secure within herself, able to look proudly at her husbandand kiss the forehead of her son without a blush. She had prayed much;she had clasped her hands for nights together over her child, refusingto let him die.""I went,"" she said, ""to the gate of the sanctuary and asked his life ofGod.""She had had visions, and she told them to me; but when she said, in thatangelic voice of hers, these exquisite words, ""While I slept my heartwatched,"" the count harshly interrupted her.""That is to say, you were half crazy,"" he cried.She was silent, as deeply hurt as though it were a first wound;forgetting that for thirteen years this man had lost no chance to shoothis arrows into her heart. Like a soaring bird struck on the wing byvulgar shot, she sank into a dull depression; then she roused herself.""How is it, monsieur,"" she said, ""that no word of mine ever finds favorin your sight? Have you no indulgence for my weakness,--no comprehensionof me as a woman?""She stopped short. Already she regretted the murmur, and measured thefuture by the past; how could she expect comprehension? Had she notdrawn upon herself some virulent attack? The blue veins of her templesthrobbed; she shed no tears, but the color of her eyes faded. Then shelooked down, that she might not see her pain reflected on my face, herfeelings guessed, her soul wooed by my soul; above all, not see thesympathy of young love, ready like a faithful dog to spring at thethroat of whoever threatened his mistress, without regard to theassailant\'s strength or quality. At such cruel moments the count\'s airof superiority was supreme. He thought he had triumphed over his wife,and he pursued her with a hail of phrases which repeated the one idea,and were like the blows of an axe which fell with unvarying sound.""Always the same?"" I said, when the count left us to follow the huntsmanwho came to speak to him.""Always,"" answered Jacques.""Always excellent, my son,"" she said, endeavoring to withdraw Monsieurde Mortsauf from the judgment of his children. ""You see only thepresent, you know nothing of the past; therefore you cannot criticiseyour father without doing him injustice. But even if you had the pain ofseeing that your father was to blame, family honor requires you to burysuch secrets in silence.""""How have the changes at the Cassine and the Rhetoriere answered?"" Iasked, to divert her mind from bitter thoughts.""Beyond my expectations,"" she replied. ""As soon as the buildings werefinished we found two excellent farmers ready to hire them; one at fourthousand five hundred francs, taxes paid; the other at five thousand;both leases for fifteen years. We have already planted three thousandyoung trees on the new farms. Manette\'s cousin is delighted to get theRabelaye; Martineau has taken the Baude. All _our_ efforts have beencrowned with success. Clochegourde, without the reserved land whichwe call the home-farm, and without the timber and vineyards, bringsin nineteen thousand francs a year, and the plantations are becomingvaluable. I am battling to let the home-farm to Martineau, the keeper,whose eldest son can now take his place. He offers three thousand francsif Monsieur de Mortsauf will build him a farm-house at the Commanderie.We might then clear the approach to Clochegourde, finish the proposedavenue to the main road, and have only the woodland and the vineyardsto take care of ourselves. If the king returns, _our_ pension will berestored; WE shall consent after clashing a little with _our_ wife\'scommon-sense. Jacques\' fortune will then be permanently secured. Thatresult obtained, I shall leave monsieur to lay by as much as he likesfor Madeleine, though the king will of course dower her, according tocustom. My conscience is easy; I have all but accomplished my task. Andyou?"" she said.I explained to her the mission on which the king had sent me, and showedher how her wise counsel had borne fruit. Was she endowed with secondsight thus to foretell events?""Did I not write it to you?"" she answered. ""For you and for my childrenalone I possess a remarkable faculty, of which I have spoken only to myconfessor, Monsieur de la Berge; he explains it by divine intervention.Often, after deep meditation induced by fears about the health of mychildren, my eyes close to the things of earth and see into anotherregion; if Jacques and Madeleine there appear to me as two luminousfigures they are sure to have good health for a certain period of time;if wrapped in mist they are equally sure to fall ill soon after. Asfor you, I not only see you brilliantly illuminated, but I hear a voicewhich explains to me without words, by some mental communication, whatyou ought to do. Does any law forbid me to use this wonderful gift formy children and for you?"" she asked, falling into a reverie. Then,after a pause, she added, ""Perhaps God wills to take the place of theirfather.""""Let me believe that my obedience is due to none but you,"" I cried.She gave me one of her exquisitely gracious smiles, which so exalted myheart that I should not have felt a death-blow if given at that moment.""As soon as the king returns to Paris, go there; leave Clochegourde,""she said. ""It may be degrading to beg for places and favors, but itwould be ridiculous to be out of the way of receiving them. Greatchanges will soon take place. The king needs capable and trustworthymen; don\'t fail him. It is well for you to enter young into the affairsof the nation and learn your way; for statesmen, like actors, have aroutine business to acquire, which genius does not reveal, it must belearnt. My father heard the Duc de Choiseul say this. Think of me,"" shesaid, after a pause; ""let me enjoy the pleasures of superiority in asoul that is all my own; for are you not my son?""""Your son?"" I said, sullenly.""Yes, my son!"" she cried, mocking me; ""is not that a good place in myheart?""The bell rang for dinner; she took my arm and leaned contentedly uponit.""You have grown,"" she said, as we went up the steps. When we reached theportico she shook my arm a little, as if my looks were importunate;for though her eyes were lowered she knew that I saw only her. Then shesaid, with a charming air of pretended impatience, full of grace andcoquetry, ""Come, why don\'t you look at our dear valley?""She turned, held her white silk sun-shade over our heads and drewJacques closely to her side. The motion of her head as she lookedtowards the Indre, the punt, the meadows, showed me that in my absenceshe had come to many an understanding with those misty horizonsand their vaporous outline. Nature was a mantle which sheltered herthoughts. She now knew what the nightingale was sighing the livelongnight, what the songster of the sedges hymned with his plaintive note.At eight o\'clock that evening I was witness of a scene which touched medeeply, and which I had never yet witnessed, for in my former visits Ihad played backgammon with the count while his wife took the childreninto the dining-room before their bedtime. The bell rang twice, and allthe servants of the household entered the room.""You are now our guest and must submit to convent rule,"" said thecountess, leading me by the hand with that air of innocent gaiety whichdistinguishes women who are naturally pious.The count followed. Masters, children, and servants knelt down, alltaking their regular places. It was Madeleine\'s turn to read theprayers. The dear child said them in her childish voice, the ingenuoustones of which rose clear in the harmonious silence of the country, andgave to the words the candor of holy innocence, the grace of angels.It was the most affecting prayer I ever heard. Nature replied to thechild\'s voice with the myriad murmurs of the coming night, like the lowaccompaniment of an organ lightly touched, Madeleine was on the rightof the countess, Jacques on her left. The graceful curly heads, betweenwhich rose the smooth braids of the mother, and above all three theperfectly white hair and yellow cranium of the father, made a picturewhich repeated, in some sort, the ideas aroused by the melody of theprayer. As if to fulfil all conditions of the unity which marks thesublime, this calm and collected group were bathed in the fading lightof the setting sun; its red tints coloring the room, impelling thesoul--be it poetic or superstitious--to believe that the fires of heavenwere visiting these faithful servants of God as they knelt there withoutdistinction of rank, in the equality which heaven demands. Thinkingback to the days of the patriarchs my mind still further magnified thisscene, so grand in its simplicity.The children said good-night, the servants bowed, the countess wentaway holding a child by each hand, and I returned to the salon with thecount.""We provide you with salvation there, and hell here,"" he said, pointingto the backgammon-board.The countess returned in half an hour, and brought her frame near thetable.""This is for you,"" she said, unrolling the canvas; ""but for the lastthree months it has languished. Between that rose and this heartsease mypoor child was ill.""""Come, come,"" said Monsieur de Mortsauf, ""don\'t talk of that any more.Six--five, emissary of the king!""When alone in my room I hushed my breathing that I might hear herpassing to and fro in hers. She was calm and pure, but I was lashed withmaddening ideas. ""Why should she not be mine?"" I thought; ""perhaps sheis, like me, in this whirlwind of agitation."" At one o\'clock, I wentdown, walking noiselessly, and lay before her door. With my ear pressedto a chink I could hear her equable, gentle breathing, like that of achild. When chilled to the bone I went back to bed and slept tranquillytill morning. I know not what prenatal influence, what nature within me,causes the delight I take in going to the brink of precipices, soundingthe gulf of evil, seeking to know its depths, feeling its icy chill, andretreating in deep emotion. That hour of night passed on the thresholdof her door where I wept with rage,--though she never knew that on themorrow her foot had trod upon my tears and kisses, on her virtue firstdestroyed and then respected, cursed and adored,--that hour, foolish inthe eyes of many, was nevertheless an inspiration of the same mysteriousimpulse which impels the soldier. Many have told me they have playedtheir lives upon it, flinging themselves before a battery to know ifthey could escape the shot, happy in thus galloping into the abyss ofprobabilities, and smoking like Jean Bart upon the gunpowder.The next day I went to gather flowers and made two bouquets. The countadmired them, though generally nothing of the kind appealed to him. Theclever saying of Champcenetz, ""He builds dungeons in Spain,"" seemed tohave been made for him.I spent several days at Clochegourde, going but seldom to Frapesle,where, however, I dined three times. The French army now occupied Tours.Though my presence was health and strength to Madame de Mortsauf, sheimplored me to make my way to Chateauroux, and so round by Issoudun andOrleans to Paris with what haste I could. I tried to resist; butshe commanded me, saying that my guardian angel spoke. I obeyed. Ourfarewell was, this time, dim with tears; she feared the allurements ofthe life I was about to live. Is it not a serious thing to enter themaelstrom of interests, passions, and pleasures which make Paris adangerous ocean for chaste love and purity of conscience? I promised towrite to her every night, relating the events and thoughts of the day,even the most trivial. When I gave the promise she laid her head on myshoulder and said: ""Leave nothing out; everything will interest me.""She gave me letters for the duke and duchess, which I delivered thesecond day after my return.""You are in luck,"" said the duke; ""dine here to-day, and go with me thisevening to the Chateau; your fortune is made. The king spoke of you thismorning, and said, \'He is young, capable, and trustworthy.\' His Majestyadded that he wished he knew whether you were living or dead, and inwhat part of France events had thrown you after you had executed yourmission so ably.""That night I was appointed master of petitions to the council of State,and I also received a private and permanent place in the employmentof Louis XVIII. himself,--a confidential position, not highlydistinguished, but without any risks, a position which put me atthe very heart of the government and has been the source of all mysubsequent prosperity. Madame de Mortsauf had judged rightly. I now owedeverything to her; power and wealth, happiness and knowledge; she guidedand encouraged me, purified my heart, and gave to my will that unityof purpose without which the powers of youth are wasted. Later I hada colleague; we each served six months. We were allowed to supply eachother\'s place if necessary; we had rooms at the Chateau, a carriage,and large allowances for travelling when absent on missions. Strangeposition! We were the secret disciples of a monarch in a policy to whicheven his enemies have since done signal justice; alone with us he gavejudgment on all things, foreign and domestic, yet we had no legitimateinfluence; often we were consulted like Laforet by Moliere, and made tofeel that the hesitations of long experience were confirmed or removedby the vigorous perceptions of youth.In other respects my future was secured in a manner to satisfy ambition.Beside my salary as master of petitions, paid by the budget of thecouncil of State, the king gave me a thousand francs a month from hisprivy purse, and often himself added more to it. Though the king knewwell that no young man of twenty-three could long bear up under thelabors with which he loaded me, my colleague, now a peer of France, wasnot appointed till August, 1817. The choice was a difficult one; ourfunctions demanded so many capabilities that the king was long in comingto a decision. He did me the honor to ask which of the young men amongwhom he was hesitating I should like for an associate. Among them wasone who had been my school-fellow at Lepitre\'s; I did not select him.His Majesty asked why.""The king,"" I replied, ""chooses men who are equally faithful, butwhose capabilities differ. I choose the one whom I think the most able,certain that I shall always be able to get on with him.""My judgment coincided with that of the king, who was pleased with thesacrifice I had made. He said on this occasion, ""You are to be thechief""; and he related these circumstances to my colleague, whobecame, in return for the service I had done him, my good friend. Theconsideration shown to me by the Duc de Lenoncourt set the tone ofthat which I met with in society. To have it said, ""The king takes aninterest in the young man; that young man has a future, the king likeshim,"" would have served me in place of talents; and it now gave to thekindly welcome accorded to youth a certain respect that is only given topower. In the salon of the Duchesse de Lenoncourt and also at the houseof my sister who had just married the Marquis de Listomere, son of theold lady in the Ile St. Louis, I gradually came to know the influentialpersonages of the Faubourg St. Germain.Henriette herself put me at the heart of the circle then called""le Petit Chateau"" by the help of her great-aunt, the Princesse deBlamont-Chauvry, to whom she wrote so warmly in my behalf that theprincess immediately sent for me. I cultivated her and contrived toplease her, and she became, not my protectress but a friend, in whosekindness there was something maternal. The old lady took pains to makeme intimate with her daughter Madame d\'Espard, with the Duchesse deLangeais, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, and the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse,women who held the sceptre of fashion, and who were all the moregracious to me because I made no pretensions and was always ready to beuseful and agreeable to them. My brother Charles, far from avoiding me,now began to lean upon me; but my rapid success roused a secret jealousyin his mind which in after years caused me great vexation. My fatherand mother, surprised by a triumph so unexpected, felt their vanityflattered, and received me at last as a son. But their feeling was tooartificial, I might say false, to let their present treatment have muchinfluence upon a sore heart. Affectations stained with selfishness winlittle sympathy; the heart abhors calculations and profits of all kinds.I wrote regularly to Henriette, who answered by two letters a month.Her spirit hovered over me, her thoughts traversed space and made theatmosphere around me pure. No woman could captivate me. The king noticedmy reserve, and as, in this respect, he belonged to the school of LouisXV., he called me, in jest, Mademoiselle de Vandenesse; but my conductpleased him. I am convinced that the habit of patience I acquired in mychildhood and practised at Clochegourde had much to do in my winning thefavor of the king, who was always most kind to me. He no doubt took afancy to read my letters, for he soon gave up his notion of my lifeas that of a young girl. One day when the duke was on duty, and I waswriting at the king\'s dictation, the latter suddenly remarked, in thatfine, silvery voice of his, to which he could give, when he chose, thebiting tone of epigram:--""So that poor devil of a Mortsauf persists in living?""""Yes,"" replied the duke.""Madame de Mortsauf is an angel, whom I should like to see at my court,""continued the king; ""but if I cannot manage it, my chancellor here,""turning to me, ""may be more fortunate. You are to have six months\'leave; I have decided on giving you the young man we spoke of yesterdayas colleague. Amuse yourself at Clochegourde, friend Cato!"" and helaughed as he had himself wheeled out of the room.I flew like a swallow to Touraine. For the first time I was to showmyself to my beloved, not merely a little less insignificant, butactually in the guise of an elegant young man, whose manners had beenformed in the best salons, his education finished by gracious women; whohad found at last a compensation for all his sufferings, and had put touse the experience given to him by the purest angel to whom heaven hadever committed the care of a child. You know how my mother had equippedme for my three months\' visit at Frapesle. When I reached Clochegourdeafter fulfilling my mission in Vendee, I was dressed like a huntsman;I wore a jacket with white and red buttons, striped trousers, leatherngaiters and shoes. Tramping through underbrush had so injured my clothesthat the count was obliged to lend me linen. On the present occasion,two years\' residence in Paris, constant intercourse with the king, thehabits of a life at ease, my completed growth, a youthful countenance,which derived a lustre from the placidity of the soul withinmagnetically united with the pure soul that beamed on me fromClochegourde,--all these things combined had transformed me. I wasself-possessed without conceit, inwardly pleased to find myself, inspite of my years, at the summit of affairs; above all, I had theconsciousness of being secretly the support and comfort of the dearestwoman on earth, and her unuttered hope. Perhaps I felt a flutter ofvanity as the postilions cracked their whips along the new avenueleading from the main road to Clochegourde and through an iron gate Ihad never seen before, which opened into a circular enclosure recentlyconstructed. I had not written to the countess of my coming, wishing tosurprise her. For this I found myself doubly in fault: first, she wasoverwhelmed with the excitement of a pleasure long desired, butsupposed to be impossible; and secondly, she proved to me that all suchdeliberate surprises are in bad taste.When Henriette saw a young man in him who had hitherto seemed but achild to her, she lowered her eyes with a sort of tragic slowness.She allowed me to take and kiss her hand without betraying her inwardpleasure, which I nevertheless felt in her sensitive shiver. When sheraised her face to look at me again, I saw that she was pale.""Well, you don\'t forget your old friends?"" said Monsieur de Mortsauf,who had neither changed nor aged.The children sprang upon me. I saw them behind the grave face of theAbbe Dominis, Jacques\' tutor.""No,"" I replied, ""and in future I am to have six months\' leave, whichwill always be spent here--Why, what is the matter?"" I said to thecountess, putting my arm round her waist and holding her up in presenceof them all.""Oh, don\'t!"" she said, springing away from me; ""it is nothing.""I read her mind, and answered to its secret thought by saying, ""Am I notallowed to be your faithful slave?""She took my arm, left the count, the children, and the abbe, and ledme to a distance on the lawn, though still within sight of the others;then, when sure that her voice could not be heard by them, she spoke.""Felix, my dear friend,"" she said, ""forgive my fears; I have but onethread by which to guide me in the labyrinth of life, and I dread to seeit broken. Tell me that I am more than ever Henriette to you, that youwill never abandon me, that nothing shall prevail against me, that youwill ever be my devoted friend. I have suddenly had a glimpse into myfuture, and you were not there, as hitherto, your eyes shining and fixedupon me--""""Henriette! idol whose worship is like that of the Divine,--lily, flowerof my life, how is it that you do not know, you who are my conscience,that my being is so fused with yours that my soul is here when my bodyis in Paris? Must I tell you that I have come in seventeen hours, thateach turn of the wheels gathered thoughts and desires in my breast,which burst forth like a tempest when I saw you?""""Yes, tell me! tell me!"" she cried; ""I am so sure of myself that I canhear you without wrong. God does not will my death. He sends you to meas he sends his breath to his creatures; as he pours the rain ofhis clouds upon a parched earth,--tell me! tell me! Do you love mesacredly?""""Sacredly.""""For ever?""""For ever.""""As a virgin Mary, hidden behind her veil, beneath her white crown.""""As a virgin visible.""""As a sister?""""As a sister too dearly loved.""""With chivalry and without hope?""""With chivalry and with hope.""""As if you were still twenty years of age, and wearing that absurd bluecoat?""""Oh better far! I love you thus, and I also love you""--she looked at mewith keen apprehension--""as you loved your aunt.""""I am happy! You dispel my terrors,"" she said, returning towards thefamily, who were surprised at our private conference. ""Be still a childat Clochegourde--for you are one still. It may be your policy to be aman with the king, but here, let me tell you, monsieur, your best policyis to remain a child. As a child you shall be loved. I can resist a man,but to a child I can refuse nothing, nothing! He can ask for nothing Iwill not give him.--Our secrets are all told,"" she said, looking atthe count with a mischievous air, in which her girlish, natural selfreappeared. ""I leave you now; I must go and dress.""Never for three years had I heard her voice so richly happy. For thefirst time I heard those swallow cries, the infantile notes of which Itold you. I had brought Jacques a hunting outfit, and for Madeleine awork-box--which her mother afterwards used. The joy of the two children,delighted to show their presents to each other, seemed to annoy thecount, always dissatisfied when attention was withdrawn from himself. Imade a sign to Madeleine and followed her father, who wanted to talk tome of his ailments.""My poor Felix,"" he said, ""you see how happy and well they all are. I amthe shadow on the picture; all their ills are transferred to me, andI bless God that it is so. Formerly I did not know what was the matterwith me; now I know. The orifice of my stomach is affected; I can digestnothing.""""How do you come to be as wise as the professor of a medical school?""I asked, laughing. ""Is your doctor indiscreet enough to tell you suchthings?""""God forbid I should consult a doctor,"" he cried, showing the aversionmost imaginary invalids feel for the medical profession.I now listened to much crazy talk, in the course of which he made themost absurd confidences,--complained of his wife, of the servants, ofthe children, of life, evidently pleased to repeat his daily speeches toa friend who, not having heard them daily, might be alarmed, and whoat any rate was forced to listen out of politeness. He must have beensatisfied, for I paid him the utmost attention, trying to penetratehis inconceivable nature, and to guess what new tortures he had beeninflicting on his wife, of which she had not written to me. Henriettepresently put an end to the monologue by appearing in the portico. Thecount saw her, shook his head, and said to me: ""You listen to me, Felix;but here no one pities me.""He went away, as if aware of the constraint he imposed on my intercoursewith Henriette, or perhaps from a really chivalrous considerationfor her, knowing he could give her pleasure by leaving us alone. Hischaracter exhibited contradictions that were often inexplicable; he wasjealous, like all weak beings, but his confidence in his wife\'s sanctitywas boundless. It may have been the sufferings of his own self-esteem,wounded by the superiority of that lofty virtue, which made him so eagerto oppose every wish of the poor woman, whom he braved as children bravetheir masters or their mothers.Jacques was taking his lessons, and Madeleine was being dressed; I hadtherefore a whole hour to walk with the countess alone on the terrace.""Dear angel!"" I said, ""the chains are heavier, the sands hotter, thethorns grow apace.""""Hush!"" she said, guessing the thoughts my conversation with the counthad suggested. ""You are here, and all is forgotten! I don\'t suffer; Ihave never suffered.""She made a few light steps as if to shake her dress and give to thebreeze its ruches of snowy tulle, its floating sleeves and freshribbons, the laces of her pelerine, and the flowing curls of hercoiffure a la Sevigne; I saw her for the first time a young girl,--gaywith her natural gaiety, ready to frolic like a child. I knew then themeaning of tears of happiness; I knew the joy a man feels in bringinghappiness to another.""Sweet human flower, wooed by my thought, kissed by my soul, oh mylily!"" I cried, ""untouched, untouchable upon thy stem, white, proud,fragrant, and solitary--""""Enough, enough,"" she said, smiling. ""Speak to me of yourself; tell meeverything.""Then, beneath the swaying arch of quivering leaves, we had a longconversation, filled with interminable parentheses, subjects taken,dropped, and retaken, in which I told her my life and my occupations; Ieven described my apartment in Paris, for she wished to know everything;and (happiness then unappreciated) I had nothing to conceal. Knowingthus my soul and all the details of a daily life full of incessant toil,learning the full extent of my functions, which to any one not sternlyupright offered opportunities for deception and dishonest gains, butwhich I had exercised with such rigid honor that the king, I told her,called me Mademoiselle de Vandenesse, she seized my hand and kissed it,and dropped a tear, a tear of joy, upon it.This sudden transposition of our roles, this homage, coupled with thethought--swiftly expressed but as swiftly comprehended--""Here is themaster I have sought, here is my dream embodied!"" all that there was ofavowal in the action, grand in its humility, where love betrayed itselfin a region forbidden to the senses,--this whirlwind of celestial thingsfell on my heart and crushed it. I felt myself too small; I wished todie at her feet.""Ah!"" I said, ""you surpass us in all things. Can you doubt me?--for youdid doubt me just now, Henriette.""""Not now,"" she answered, looking at me with ineffable tenderness, which,for a moment, veiled the light of her eyes. ""But seeing you so changed,so handsome, I said to myself, \'Our plans for Madeleine will be defeatedby some woman who will guess the treasures in his heart; she will stealour Felix, and destroy all happiness here.\'""""Always Madeleine!"" I replied. ""Is it Madeleine to whom I am faithful?""We fell into a silence which Monsieur de Mortsauf inconvenientlyinterrupted. I was forced to keep up a conversation bristling withdifficulties, in which my honest replies as to the king\'s policy jarredwith the count\'s ideas, and he forced me to explain again and again theking\'s intentions. In spite of all my questions as to his horses, hisagricultural affairs, whether he was satisfied with his five farms,whether he meant to cut the timber of the old avenue, he returned to thesubject of politics with the pestering faculty of an old maid and thepersistency of a child. Minds like his prefer to dash themselves againstthe light; they return again and again and hum about it without evergetting into it, like those big flies which weary our ears as they buzzupon the glass.Henriette was silent. To stop the conversation, in which I fearedmy young blood might take fire, I answered in monosyllables, mostlyacquiescent, avoiding discussion; but Monsieur de Mortsauf had too muchsense not to perceive the meaning of my politeness. Presently he wasangry at being always in the right; he grew refractory, his eyebrows andthe wrinkles of his forehead worked, his yellow eyes blazed, his rufousnose grew redder, as it did on the day I first witnessed an attack ofmadness. Henriette gave me a supplicating look, making me understandthat she could not employ on my behalf an authority to which shehad recourse to protect her children. I at once answered the countseriously, taking up the political question, and managing his peevishspirit with the utmost care.""Poor dear! poor dear!"" she murmured two or three times; the wordsreaching my ear like a gentle breeze. When she could intervene withsuccess she said, interrupting us, ""Let me tell you, gentlemen, that youare very dull company.""Recalled by this conversation to his chivalrous sense of what was due toa woman, the count ceased to talk politics, and as we bored him in ourturn by commonplace matters, he presently left us to continue our walk,declaring that it made his head spin to go round and round on the samepath.My sad conjectures were true. The soft landscape, the warm atmosphere,the cloudless skies, the soothing poetry of this valley, which forfifteen years had calmed the stinging fancies of that diseased mind,were now impotent. At a period of life when the asperities of othermen are softened and their angles smoothed, the disposition of this manbecame more and more aggressive. For the last few months he had takena habit of contradicting for the sake of contradiction, without reason,without even trying to justify his opinions; he insisted on knowing thewhy and the wherefore of everything; grew restless under a delay oran omission; meddled with every item of the household affairs, andcompelled his wife and the servants to render him the most minuteand fatiguing account of all that was done; never allowing them theslightest freedom of action. Formerly he did not lose his temper exceptfor some special reason; now his irritation was constant. Perhaps thecare of his farms, the interests of agriculture, an active out-door lifehad formerly soothed his atrabilious temper by giving it a field for itsuneasiness, and by furnishing employment for his activity. Possibly theloss of such occupation had allowed his malady to prey upon itself; nolonger exercised on matters without, it was showing itself in more fixedideas; the moral being was laying hold of the physical being. He hadlately become his own doctor; he studied medical books, fancied he hadthe diseases he read of, and took the most extraordinary and unheard ofprecautions about his health,--precautions never the same, impossible toforesee, and consequently impossible to satisfy. Sometimes he wanted nonoise; then, when the countess had succeeded in establishing absolutesilence, he would declare he was in a tomb, and blame her for notfinding some medium between incessant noise and the stillness of LaTrappe. Sometimes he affected a perfect indifference for all earthlythings. Then the whole household breathed freely; the children played;family affairs went on without criticism. Suddenly he would cry outlamentably, ""They want to kill me!--My dear,"" he would say to his wife,increasing the injustice of his words by the aggravating tones of hissharp voice, ""if it concerned your children you would know very wellwhat was the matter with them.""He dressed and re-dressed himself incessantly, watching every changeof temperature, and doing nothing without consulting the barometer.Notwithstanding his wife\'s attentions, he found no food to suit him, hisstomach being, he said, impaired, and digestion so painful as to keephim awake all night. In spite of this he ate, drank, digested, andslept, in a manner to satisfy any doctor. His capricious will exhaustedthe patience of the servants, accustomed to the beaten track of domesticservice and unable to conform to the requirements of his conflictingorders. Sometimes he bade them keep all the windows open, declaring thathis health required a current of fresh air; a few days later thefresh air, being too hot or too damp, as the case might be, becameintolerable; then he scolded, quarrelled with the servants, and in orderto justify himself, denied his former orders. This defect of memory, orthis bad faith, call it which you will, always carried the day againsthis wife in the arguments by which she tried to pit him against himself.Life at Clochegourde had become so intolerable that the Abbe Dominis, aman of great learning, took refuge in the study of scientific problems,and withdrew into the shelter of pretended abstraction. The countess hadno longer any hope of hiding the secret of these insane furies withinthe circle of her own home; the servants had witnessed scenes ofexasperation without exciting cause, in which the premature old manpassed the bounds of reason. They were, however, so devoted to thecountess that nothing so far had transpired outside; but she dreadeddaily some public outburst of a frenzy no longer controlled by respectfor opinion.Later I learned the dreadful details of the count\'s treatment of hiswife. Instead of supporting her when the children were ill, he assailedher with dark predictions and made her responsible for all futureillnesses, because she refused to let the children take the crazy doseswhich he prescribed. When she went to walk with them the count wouldpredict a storm in the face of a clear sky; if by chance the predictionproved true, the satisfaction he felt made him quite indifferent toany harm to the children. If one of them was ailing, the count gavehis whole mind to fastening the cause of the illness upon the systemof nursing adopted by his wife, whom he carped at for every triflingdetail, always ending with the cruel words, ""If your children fall illagain you have only yourself to thank for it.""He behaved in the same way in the management of the household, seeingthe worst side of everything, and making himself, as his old coachmansaid, ""the devil\'s own advocate."" The countess arranged that Jacquesand Madeleine should take their meals alone at different hours from thefamily, so as to save them from the count\'s outbursts and draw all thestorms upon herself. In this way the children now saw but little oftheir father. By one of the hallucinations peculiar to selfish persons,the count had not the slightest idea of the misery he caused. In theconfidential communication he made to me on my arrival he particularlydwelt on his goodness to his family. He wielded the flail, beat,bruised, and broke everything about him as a monkey might have done.Then, having half-destroyed his prey, he denied having touched it. I nowunderstood the lines on Henriette\'s forehead,--fine lines, traced as itwere with the edge of a razor, which I had noticed the moment I saw her.There is a pudicity in noble minds which withholds them from speakingof their personal sufferings; proudly they hide the extent of theirwoes from hearts that love them, feeling a merciful joy in doing so.Therefore in spite of my urgency, I did not immediately obtain the truthfrom Henriette. She feared to grieve me; she made brief admissions,and then blushed for them; but I soon perceived myself the increase oftrouble which the count\'s present want of regular occupation had broughtupon the household.""Henriette,"" I said, after I had been there some days, ""don\'t you thinkyou have made a mistake in so arranging the estate that the count has nolonger anything to do?""""Dear,"" she said, smiling, ""my situation is critical enough to take allmy attention; believe me, I have considered all my resources, and theyare now exhausted. It is true that the bickerings are getting worseand worse. As Monsieur de Mortsauf and I are always together, I cannotlessen them by diverting his attention in other directions; in fact thepain would be the same to me in any case. I did think of advising himto start a nursery for silk-worms at Clochegourde, where we have manymulberry-trees, remains of the old industry of Touraine. But I reflectedthat he would still be the same tyrant at home, and I should havemany more annoyances through the enterprise. You will learn, my dearobserver, that in youth a man\'s ill qualities are restrained by society,checked in their swing by the play of passions, subdued under the fearof public opinion; later, a middle-aged man, living in solitude, showshis native defects, which are all the more terrible because so longrepressed. Human weaknesses are essentially base; they allow of neitherpeace nor truce; what you yield to them to-day they exact to-morrow, andalways; they fasten on concessions and compel more of them. Power, onthe other hand, is merciful; it conforms to evidence, it is just and itis peaceable. But the passions born of weakness are implacable. Monsieurde Mortsauf takes an absolute pleasure in getting the better of me; andhe who would deceive no one else, deceives me with delight.""One morning as we left the breakfast table, about a month after myarrival, the countess took me by the arm, darted through an iron gatewhich led into the vineyard, and dragged me hastily among the vines.""He will kill me!"" she cried. ""And I want to live--for my children\'ssake. But oh! not a day\'s respite! Always to walk among thorns! tocome near falling every instant! every instant to have to summon all mystrength to keep my balance! No human being can long endure such strainupon the system. If I were certain of the ground I ought to take, if myresistance could be a settled thing, then my mind might concentrate uponit--but no, every day the attacks change character and leave me withoutdefence; my sorrows are not one, they are manifold. Ah! my friend--""she cried, leaning her head upon my shoulder, and not continuing herconfidence. ""What will become of me? Oh, what shall I do?"" she saidpresently, struggling with thoughts she did not express. ""How can Iresist? He will kill me! No, I will kill myself--but that would bea crime! Escape? yes, but my children! Separate from him? how, afterfifteen years of marriage, how could I ever tell my parents that I willnot live with him? for if my father and mother came here he would becalm, polite, intelligent, judicious. Besides, can married women look tofathers or mothers? Do they not belong body and soul to their husbands?I could live tranquil if not happy--I have found strength in my chastesolitude, I admit it; but if I am deprived of this negative happinessI too shall become insane. My resistance is based on powerful reasonswhich are not personal to myself. It is a crime to give birth to poorcreatures condemned to endless suffering. Yet my position raises seriousquestions, so serious that I dare not decide them alone; I cannot bejudge and party both. To-morrow I will go to Tours and consult my newconfessor, the Abbe Birotteau--for my dear and virtuous Abbe de la Bergeis dead,"" she said, interrupting herself. ""Though he was severe, I missand shall always miss his apostolic power. His successor is an angel ofgoodness, who pities but does not reprimand. Still, all courage drawsfresh life from the heart of religion; what soul is not strengthened bythe voice of the Holy Spirit? My God,"" she said, drying her tearsand raising her eyes to heaven, ""for what sin am I thus punished?--Ibelieve, yes, Felix, I believe it, we must pass through a fiery furnacebefore we reach the saints, the just made perfect of the upper spheres.Must I keep silence? Am I forbidden, oh, my God, to cry to the heart ofa friend? Do I love him too well?"" She pressed me to her heart as thoughshe feared to lose me. ""Who will solve my doubts? My conscience does notreproach me. The stars shine from above on men; may not the soul, thehuman star, shed its light upon a friend, if we go to him with purethoughts?""I listened to this dreadful cry in silence, holding her moist handin mine that was still more moist. I pressed it with a force to whichHenriette replied with an equal pressure.""Where are you?"" cried the count, who came towards us, bareheaded.Ever since my return he had insisted on sharing our interviews,--eitherbecause he wanted amusement, or feared the countess would tell me hersorrows and complain to me, or because he was jealous of a pleasure hedid not share.""How he follows me!"" she cried, in a tone of despair. ""Let us go intothe orchard, we shall escape him. We can stoop as we run by the hedge,and he will not see us.""We made the hedge a rampart and reached the enclosure, where we weresoon at a good distance from the count in an alley of almond-trees.""Dear Henriette,"" I then said to her, pressing her arm against my heartand stopping to contemplate her in her sorrow, ""you have guided me withtrue knowledge along the perilous ways of the great world; let me inreturn give you some advice which may help you to end this duel withoutwitnesses, in which you must inevitably be worsted, for you are fightingwith unequal weapons. You must not struggle any longer with a madman--""""Hush!"" she said, dashing aside the tears that rolled from her eyes.""Listen to me, dear,"" I continued. ""After a single hour\'s talk with thecount, which I force myself to endure for love of you, my thoughts arebewildered, my head heavy; he makes me doubtful of my own intellect; thesame ideas repeated over and over again seem to burn themselves onmy brain. Well-defined monomanias are not communicated; but when themadness consists in a distorted way of looking at everything, and whenit lurks under all discussions, then it can and does injure the minds ofthose who live with it. Your patience is sublime, but will it not end indisordering you? For your sake, for that of your children, change yoursystem with the count. Your adorable kindness has made him selfish; youhave treated him as a mother treats the child she spoils; but now, ifyou want to live--and you do want it,"" I said, looking at her, ""usethe control you have over him. You know what it is; he loves you andhe fears you; make him fear you more; oppose his erratic will with yourfirm will. Extend your power over him, confine his madness to a moralsphere just as we lock maniacs in a cell.""""Dear child,"" she said, smiling bitterly, ""a woman without a heartmight do it. But I am a mother; I should make a poor jailer. Yes, I cansuffer, but I cannot make others suffer. Never!"" she said, ""never! noteven to obtain some great and honorable result. Besides, I shouldhave to lie in my heart, disguise my voice, lower my head, degrade mygesture--do not ask of me such falsehoods. I can stand between Monsieurde Mortsauf and his children, I willingly receive his blows that theymay not fall on others; I can do all that, and will do it to conciliateconflicting interests, but I can do no more.""""Let me worship thee, O saint, thrice holy!"" I exclaimed, kneeling ather feet and kissing her robe, with which I wiped my tears. ""But if hekills you?"" I cried.She turned pale and said, lifting her eyes to heaven:""God\'s will be done!""""Do you know that the king said to your father, \'So that devil of aMortsauf is still living\'?""""A jest on the lips of the king,"" she said, ""is a crime when repeatedhere.""In spite of our precautions the count had tracked us; he now arrived,bathed in perspiration, and sat down under a walnut-tree where thecountess had stopped to give me that rebuke. I began to talk about thevintage; the count was silent, taking no notice of the dampness underthe tree. After a few insignificant remarks, interspersed with pausesthat were very significant, he complained of nausea and headache; but hespoke gently, and did not appeal to our pity, or describe his sufferingsin his usual exaggerated way. We paid no attention to him. When wereached the house, he said he felt worse and should go to bed; which hedid, quite naturally and with much less complaint than usual. We tookadvantage of the respite and went down to our dear terrace accompaniedby Madeleine.""Let us get that boat and go upon the river,"" said the countess afterwe had made a few turns. ""We might go and look at the fishing which isgoing on to-day.""We went out by the little gate, found the punt, jumped into it andwere presently paddling up the Loire. Like three children amused withtrifles, we looked at the sedges along the banks and the blue and greendragon-flies; the countess wondered perhaps that she was able toenjoy such peaceful pleasures in the midst of her poignant griefs;but Nature\'s calm, indifferent to our struggles, has a magic gift ofconsolation. The tumults of a love full of restrained desires harmonizewith the wash of the water; the flowers that the hand of man has neverwilted are the voice of his secret dreams; the voluptuous swaying of theboat vaguely responds to the thoughts that are floating in his soul.We felt the languid influence of this double poesy. Words, tuned to thediapason of nature, disclosed mysterious graces; looks were impassionedrays sharing the light shed broadcast by the sun on the glowing meadows.The river was a path along which we flew. Our spirit, no longer keptdown by the measured tread of our footsteps, took possession of theuniverse. The abounding joy of a child at liberty, graceful in itsmotions, enticing in its play, is the living expression of two freedsouls, delighting themselves by becoming ideally the wondrous beingdreamed of by Plato and known to all whose youth has been filled witha blessed love. To describe to you that hour, not in its indescribabledetails but in its essence, I must say to you that we loved each otherin all the creations animate and inanimate which surrounded us; we feltwithout us the happiness our own hearts craved; it so penetrated ourbeing that the countess took off her gloves and let her hands float inthe water as if to cool an inward ardor. Her eyes spoke; but her mouth,opening like a rose to the breeze, gave voice to no desire. You know theharmony of deep tones mingling perfectly with high ones? Ever, when Ihear it now, it recalls to me the harmony of our two souls in this onehour, which never came again.""Where do you fish?"" I asked, ""if you can only do so from the banks youown?""""Near Pont-de-Ruan,"" she replied. ""Ah! we now own the river fromPont-de-Ruan to Clochegourde; Monsieur de Mortsauf has lately boughtforty acres of the meadow lands with the savings of two years and thearrearage of his pension. Does that surprise you?""""Surprise me?"" I cried; ""I would that all the valley were yours."" Sheanswered me with a smile. Presently we came below the bridge to a placewhere the Indre widens and where the fishing was going on.""Well, Martineau?"" she said.""Ah, Madame la comtesse, such bad luck! We have fished up from the millthe last three hours, and have taken nothing.""We landed near them to watch the drawing in of the last net, and allthree of us sat down in the shade of a ""bouillard,"" a sort of poplarwith a white bark, which grows on the banks of the Danube and the Loire(probably on those of other large rivers), and sheds, in the springof the year, a white and silky fluff, the covering of its flower. Thecountess had recovered her august serenity; she half regretted theunveiling of her griefs, and mourned that she had cried aloud like Job,instead of weeping like the Magdalen,--a Magdalen without loves, orgalas, or prodigalities, but not without beauty and fragrance. The netcame in at her feet full of fish; tench, barbels, pike, perch, and anenormous carp, which floundered about on the grass.""Madame brings luck!"" exclaimed the keeper.All the laborers opened their eyes as they looked with admiration at thewoman whose fairy wand seemed to have touched the nets. Just then thehuntsman was seen urging his horse over the meadows at a full gallop.Fear took possession of her. Jacques was not with us, and the mother\'sfirst thought, as Virgil so poetically says, is to press her children toher breast when danger threatens.""Jacques! Where is Jacques? What has happened to my boy?""She did not love me! If she had loved me I should have seen upon herface when confronted with my sufferings that expression of a lioness indespair.""Madame la comtesse, Monsieur le comte is worse.""She breathed more freely and started to run towards Clochegourde,followed by me and by Madeleine.""Follow me slowly,"" she said, looking back; ""don\'t let the dear childoverheat herself. You see how it is; Monsieur de Mortsauf took thatwalk in the sun which put him into a perspiration, and sitting under thewalnut-tree may be the cause of a great misfortune.""The words, said in the midst of her agitation, showed plainly thepurity of her soul. The death of the count a misfortune! She reachedClochegourde with great rapidity, passing through a gap in the wall andcrossing the fields. I returned slowly. Henriette\'s words lighted mymind, but as the lightning falls and blasts the gathered harvest. Onthe river I had fancied I was her chosen one; now I felt bitterly thesincerity of her words. The lover who is not everything is nothing. Iloved with the desire of a love that knows what it seeks; which feeds inadvance on coming transports, and is content with the pleasures ofthe soul because it mingles with them others which the future keepsin store. If Henriette loved, it was certain that she knew neither thepleasures of love nor its tumults. She lived by feelings only, like asaint with God. I was the object on which her thoughts fastened asbees swarm upon the branch of a flowering tree. In my mad jealousy Ireproached myself that I had dared nothing, that I had not tightenedthe bonds of a tenderness which seemed to me at that moment more subtilethan real, by the chains of positive possession.The count\'s illness, caused perhaps by a chill under the walnut-tree,became alarming in a few hours. I went to Tours for a famous doctornamed Origet, but was unable to find him until evening. He spent thatnight and the next day at Clochegourde. We had sent the huntsman inquest of leeches, but the doctor, thinking the case urgent, wished tobleed the count immediately, but had brought no lancet with him. Iat once started for Azay in the midst of a storm, roused a surgeon,Monsieur Deslandes, and compelled him to come with the utmost celerityto Clochegourde. Ten minutes later and the count would have died; thebleeding saved him. But in spite of this preliminary success the doctorpredicted an inflammatory fever of the worst kind. The countess wasovercome by the fear that she was the secret cause of this crisis. Twoweak to thank me for my exertions, she merely gave me a few smiles, theequivalent of the kiss she had once laid upon my hand. Fain would I haveseen in those haggard smiles the remorse of illicit love; but no, theywere only the act of contrition of an innocent repentance, painful tosee in one so pure, the expression of admiring tenderness for me whomshe regarded as noble while reproaching herself for an imaginary wrong.Surely she loved as Laura loved Petrarch, and not as Francesca da Riminiloved Paolo,--a terrible discovery for him who had dreamed the union ofthe two loves.The countess half lay, her body bent forwards, her arms hanging, in asoiled armchair in a room that was like the lair of a wild boar. Thenext evening before the doctor departed he said to the countess, who hadsat up the night before, that she must get a nurse, as the illness wouldbe a long one.""A nurse!"" she said; ""no, no! We will take care of him,"" she added,looking at me; ""we owe it to ourselves to save him.""The doctor gave us both an observing look full of astonishment. Thewords were of a nature to make him suspect an atonement. He promisedto come twice a week, left directions for the treatment with MonsieurDeslandes, and pointed out the threatening symptoms that might obligeus to send for him. I asked the countess to let me sit up the alternatenights and then, not without difficulty, I persuaded her to go to bed onthe third night. When the house was still and the count sleeping I hearda groan from Henriette\'s room. My anxiety was so keen that I went toher. She was kneeling before the crucifix bathed in tears. ""My God!"" shecried; ""if this be the cost of a murmur, I will never complain again.""""You have left him!"" she said on seeing me.""I heard you moaning, and I was frightened.""""Oh, I!"" she said; ""I am well.""Wishing to be certain that Monsieur de Mortsauf was asleep she camedown with me; by the light of the lamp we looked at him. The count wasweakened by the loss of blood and was more drowsy than asleep; his handspicked the counterpane and tried to draw it over him.""They say the dying do that,"" she whispered. ""Ah! if he were to die ofthis illness, that I have caused, never will I marry again, I swear it,""she said, stretching her hand over his head with a solemn gesture.""I have done all I could to save him,"" I said.""Oh, you!"" she said, ""you are good; it is I who am guilty.""She stooped to that discolored brow, wiped the perspiration from it andlaid a kiss there solemnly; but I saw, not without joy, that she did itas an expiation.""Blanche, I am thirsty,"" said the count in a feeble voice.""You see he knows me,"" she said giving him to drink.Her accent, her affectionate manner to him seemed to me to take thefeelings that bound us together and immolate them to the sick man.""Henriette,"" I said, ""go and rest, I entreat you.""""No more Henriette,"" she said, interrupting me with imperious haste.""Go to bed if you would not be ill. Your children, _he himself_ wouldorder you to be careful; it is a case where selfishness becomes avirtue.""""Yes,"" she said.She went away, recommending her husband to my care by a gesture whichwould have seemed like approaching delirium if childlike grace had notbeen mingled with the supplicating forces of repentance. But the scenewas terrible, judged by the habitual state of that pure soul; it alarmedme; I feared the exaltation of her conscience. When the doctorcame again, I revealed to him the nature of my pure Henriette\'sself-reproach. This confidence, made discreetly, removed MonsieurOriget\'s suspicions, and enabled him to quiet the distress of that noblesoul by telling her that in any case the count had to pass through thiscrisis, and that as for the nut-tree, his remaining there had done moregood than harm by developing the disease.For fifty-two days the count hovered between life and death. Henrietteand I each watched twenty-six nights. Undoubtedly, Monsieur de Mortsaufowed his life to our nursing and to the careful exactitude with whichwe carried out the orders of Monsieur Origet. Like all philosophicalphysicians, whose sagacious observation of what passes before themjustifies many a doubt of noble actions when they are only theaccomplishment of a duty, this man, while assisting the countess andme in our rivalry of devotion, could not help watching us, withscrutinizing glances, so afraid was he of being deceived in hisadmiration.""In diseases of this nature,"" he said to me at his third visit, ""deathhas a powerful auxiliary in the moral nature when that is seriouslydisturbed, as it is in this case. The doctor, the family, the nurseshold the patient\'s life in their hands; sometimes a single word, a fearexpressed by a gesture, has the effect of poison.""As he spoke Origet studied my face and expression; but he saw in my eyesthe clear look of an honest soul. In fact during the whole course ofthis distressing illness there never passed through my mind a single oneof the involuntary evil thoughts which do sometimes sear the consciencesof the innocent. To those who study nature in its grandeur as awhole all tends to unity through assimilation. The moral world mustundoubtedly be ruled by an analogous principle. In an pure sphere allis pure. The atmosphere of heaven was around my Henriette; it seemed asthough an evil desire must forever part me from her. Thus she not onlystood for happiness, but for virtue; she _was_ virtue. Finding us alwaysequally careful and attentive, the doctor\'s words and manners took atone of respect and even pity; he seemed to say to himself, ""Hereare the real sufferers; they hide their ills, and forget them."" By afortunate change, which, according to our excellent doctor, is commonenough in men who are completely shattered, Monsieur de Mortsaufwas patient, obedient, complained little, and showed surprisingdocility,--he, who when well never did the simplest thing withoutdiscussion. The secret of this submission to medical care, which heformerly so derided, was an innate dread of death; another contradictionin a man of tried courage. This dread may perhaps explain severalother peculiarities in the character which the cruel years of exile haddeveloped.Shall I admit to you, Natalie, and will you believe me? these fifty daysand the month that followed them were the happiest moments of my life.Love, in the celestial spaces of the soul is like a noble river flowingthrough a valley; the rains, the brooks, the torrents hie to it, thetrees fall upon its surface, so do the flowers, the gravel of itsshores, the rocks of the summits; storms and the loitering tribute ofthe crystal streams alike increase it. Yes, when love comes all comes tolove!The first great danger over, the countess and I grew accustomed toillness. In spite of the confusion which the care of the sick entails,the count\'s room, once so untidy, was now clean and inviting. Soonwe were like two beings flung upon a desert island, for not only doanxieties isolate, but they brush aside as petty the conventions of theworld. The welfare of the sick man obliged us to have points of contactwhich no other circumstances would have authorized. Many a time ourhands, shy or timid formerly, met in some service that we rendered tothe count--was I not there to sustain and help my Henriette? Absorbedin a duty comparable to that of a soldier at the pickets, she forgotto eat; then I served her, sometimes on her lap, a hasty meal whichnecessitated a thousand little attentions. We were like children at agrave. She would order me sharply to prepare whatever might ease thesick man\'s suffering; she employed me in a hundred petty ways. Duringthe time when actual danger obscured, as it does during the battle, thesubtile distinctions which characterize the facts of ordinary life,she necessarily laid aside the reserve which all women, even the mostunconventional, preserve in their looks and words and actions before theworld or their own family. At the first chirping of the birds she wouldcome to relieve my watch, wearing a morning garment which revealed tome once more the dazzling treasures that in my folly I had treated as myown. Always dignified, nay imposing, she could still be familiar.Thus it came to pass that we found ourselves unconsciously intimate,half-married as it were. She showed herself nobly confiding, as sure ofme as she was of herself. I was thus taken deeper and deeper into herheart. The countess became once more my Henriette, Henriette constrainedto love with increasing strength the friend who endeavored to be hersecond soul. Her hand unresistingly met mine at the least solicitation;my eyes were permitted to follow with delight the lines of her beautyduring the long hours when we listened to the count\'s breathing, withoutdriving her from their sight. The meagre pleasures which we allowedourselves--sympathizing looks, words spoken in whispers not to wakethe count, hopes and fears repeated and again repeated, in short, thethousand incidents of the fusion of two hearts long separated--standout in bright array upon the sombre background of the actual scene. Oursouls knew each other to their depths under this test, which many a warmaffection is unable to bear, finding life too heavy or too flimsy in theclose bonds of hourly intercourse.You know what disturbance follows the illness of a master; how theaffairs of life seem to come to a standstill. Though the real care ofthe family and estate fell upon Madame de Mortsauf, the count was usefulin his way; he talked with the farmers, transacted business with hisbailiff, and received the rents; if she was the soul, he was the body.I now made myself her steward so that she could nurse the count withoutneglecting the property. She accepted this as a matter of course, infact without thanking me. It was another sweet communion to share herfamily cares, to transmit her orders. In the evenings we often met inher room to discuss these interests and those of her children. Suchconversations gave one semblance the more to our transitory marriage.With what delight she encouraged me to take a husband\'s place, giving mehis seat at table, sending me to talk with the bailiff,--all in perfectinnocence, yet not without that inward pleasure the most virtuous womanin the world will feel when she finds a course where strict obedience toduty and the satisfaction of her wishes are combined.Nullified, as it were, by illness, the count no longer oppressed hiswife or his household, the countess then became her natural self; shebusied herself with my affairs and showed me a thousand kindnesses. Withwhat joy I discovered in her mind a thought, vaguely conceived perhaps,but exquisitely expressed, namely, to show me the full value of herperson and her qualities and make me see the change that would come overher if she lived understood. This flower, kept in the cold atmosphereof such a home, opened to my gaze, and to mine only; she took as muchdelight in letting me comprehend her as I felt in studying her with thesearching eyes of love. She proved to me in all the trifling thingsof daily life how much I was in her thoughts. When, after my turn ofwatching, I went to bed and slept late, Henriette would keep the houseabsolutely silent near me; Jacques and Madeleine played elsewhere,though never ordered to do so; she invented excuses to serve mybreakfast herself--ah, with what sparkling pleasure in her movements,what swallow-like rapidity, what lynx-eyed perception! and then! whatcarnation on her cheeks, what quiverings in her voice!Can such expansions of the soul be described in words?Often she was wearied out; but if, at such moments of lassitude mywelfare came in question, for me, as for her children, she found freshstrength and sprang up eagerly and joyfully. How she loved to shed hertenderness like sunbeams in the air! Ah, Natalie, some women sharethe privileges of angels here below; they diffuse that light whichSaint-Martin, the mysterious philosopher, declared to be intelligent,melodious, and perfumed. Sure of my discretion, Henriette took pleasurein raising the curtain which hid the future and in showing me two womenin her,--the woman bound hand and foot who had won me in spite of herseverity, and the woman freed, whose sweetness should make my loveeternal! What a difference. Madame de Mortsauf was the skylark ofBengal, transported to our cold Europe, mournful on its perch, silentand dying in the cage of a naturalist; Henriette was the singing bird oforiental poems in groves beside the Ganges, flying from branch to branchlike a living jewel amid the roses of a volkameria that ever blooms. Herbeauty grew more beautiful, her mind recovered strength. The continualsparkle of this happiness was a secret between ourselves, for shedreaded the eye of the Abbe Dominis, the representative of the world;she masked her contentment with playfulness, and covered the proofs ofher tenderness with the banner of gratitude.""We have put your friendship to a severe test, Felix; we may give youthe same rights we give to Jacques, may we not, Monsieur l\'abbe?"" shesaid one day.The stern abbe answered with the smile of a man who can read the humanheart and see its purity; for the countess he always showed the respectmingled with adoration which the angels inspire. Twice during thosefifty days the countess passed beyond the limits in which we held ouraffection. But even these infringements were shrouded in a veil, neverlifted until the final hour when avowal came. One morning, during thefirst days of the count\'s illness, when she repented her harsh treatmentin withdrawing the innocent privileges she had formerly granted me, Iwas expecting her to relieve my watch. Much fatigued, I fell asleep, myhead against the wall. I wakened suddenly at the touch of somethingcool upon my forehead which gave me a sensation as if a rose had restedthere. I opened my eyes and saw the countess, standing a few stepsdistant, who said, ""I have just come."" I rose to leave the room, but asI bade her good-bye I took her hand; it was moist and trembling.""Are you ill?"" I said.""Why do you ask that question?"" she replied.I looked at her blushing and confused. ""I was dreaming,"" I replied.Another time, when Monsieur Origet had announced positively that thecount was convalescent, I was lying with Jacques and Madeleine on thestep of the portico intent on a game of spillikins which we were playingwith bits of straw and hooks made of pins; Monsieur de Mortsauf wasasleep. The doctor, while waiting for his horse to be harnessed, wastalking with the countess in the salon. Monsieur Origet went awaywithout my noticing his departure. After he left, Henriette leanedagainst the window, from which she watched us for some time withoutour seeing her. It was one of those warm evenings when the sky iscopper-colored and the earth sends up among the echoes a myriad minglingnoises. A last ray of sunlight was leaving the roofs, the flowers inthe garden perfumed the air, the bells of the cattle returning to theirstalls sounded in the distance. We were all conforming to the silenceof the evening hour and hushing our voices that we might not wakethe count. Suddenly, I heard the guttural sound of a sob violentlysuppressed; I rushed into the salon and found the countess sitting bythe window with her handkerchief to her face. She heard my step and mademe an imperious gesture, commanding me to leave her. I went up to her,my heart stabbed with fear, and tried to take her handkerchief away byforce. Her face was bathed in tears and she fled into her room, whichshe did not leave again until the hour for evening prayer. When that wasover, I led her to the terrace and asked the cause of her emotion; sheaffected a wild gaiety and explained it by the news Monsieur Origet hadgiven her.""Henriette, Henriette, you knew that news when I saw you weeping.Between you and me a lie is monstrous. Why did you forbid me to dry yourtears? were they mine?""""I was thinking,"" she said, ""that for me this illness has been a haltin pain. Now that I no longer fear for Monsieur de Mortsauf I fear formyself.""She was right. The count\'s recovery was soon attested by the return ofhis fantastic humor. He began by saying that neither the countess, norI, nor the doctor had known how to take care of him; we were ignorantof his constitution and also of his disease; we misunderstood hissufferings and the necessary remedies. Origet, infatuated with his owndoctrines, had mistaken the case, he ought to have attended only tothe pylorus. One day he looked at us maliciously, with an air of havingguessed our thoughts, and said to his wife with a smile, ""Now, my dear,if I had died you would have regretted me, no doubt, but pray admit youwould have been quite resigned.""""Yes, I should have mourned you in pink and black, court mourning,"" sheanswered laughing, to change the tone of his remarks.But it was chiefly about his food, which the doctor insisted onregulating, that scenes of violence and wrangling now took place, unlikeany that had hitherto occurred; for the character of the count was allthe more violent for having slumbered. The countess, fortified by thedoctor\'s orders and the obedience of her servants, stimulated too byme, who thought this struggle a good means to teach her to exerciseauthority over the count, held out against his violence. She showeda calm front to his demented cries, and even grew accustomed to hisinsulting epithets, taking him for what he was, a child. I had thehappiness of at last seeing her take the reins in hand and govern thatunsound mind. The count cried out, but he obeyed; and he obeyed all thebetter when he had made an outcry. But in spite of the evidence of goodresults, Henriette often wept at the spectacle of this emaciated, feebleold man, with a forehead yellower than the falling leaves, his eyes wan,his hands trembling. She blamed herself for too much severity, and couldnot resist the joy she saw in his eyes when, in measuring out his food,she gave him more than the doctor allowed. She was even more gentle andgracious to him than she had been to me; but there were differenceshere which filled my heart with joy. She was not unwearying, and shesometimes called her servants to wait upon the count when his capriceschanged too rapidly, and he complained of not being understood.The countess wished to return thanks to God for the count\'s recovery;she directed a mass to be said, and asked if I would take her to church.I did so, but I left her at the door, and went to see Monsieur andMadame Chessel. On my return she reproached me.""Henriette,"" I said, ""I cannot be false. I will throw myself into thewater to save my enemy from drowning, and give him my coat to keep himwarm; I will forgive him, but I cannot forget the wrong.""She was silent, but she pressed my arm.""You are an angel, and you were sincere in your thanksgiving,"" I said,continuing. ""The mother of the Prince of the Peace was saved from thehands of an angry populace who sought to kill her, and when the queenasked, \'What did you do?\' she answered, \'I prayed for them.\' Women areever thus. I am a man, and necessarily imperfect.""""Don\'t calumniate yourself,"" she said, shaking my arm, ""perhaps you aremore worthy than I.""""Yes,"" I replied, ""for I would give eternity for a day of happiness, andyou--""""I!"" she said haughtily.I was silent and lowered my eyes to escape the lightning of hers.""There is many an I in me,"" she said. ""Of which do you speak? Thosechildren,"" pointing to Jacques and Madeleine, ""are one--Felix,"" shecried in a heartrending voice, ""do you think me selfish? Ought I tosacrifice eternity to reward him who devotes to me his life? The thoughtis dreadful; it wounds every sentiment of religion. Could a woman sofallen rise again? Would her happiness absolve her? These are questionsyou force me to consider.--Yes, I betray at last the secret of myconscience; the thought has traversed my heart; often do I expiate it bypenance; it caused the tears you asked me to account for yesterday--""""Do you not give too great importance to certain things which commonwomen hold at a high price, and--""""Oh!"" she said, interrupting me; ""do you hold them at a lower?""This logic stopped all argument.""Know this,"" she continued. ""I might have the baseness to abandonthat poor old man whose life I am; but, my friend, those other feeblecreatures there before us, Madeleine and Jacques, would remain withtheir father. Do you think, I ask you do you think they would be alivein three months under the insane dominion of that man? If my failure ofduty concerned only myself--"" A noble smile crossed her face. ""But shallI kill my children! My God!"" she exclaimed. ""Why speak of these things?Marry, and let me die!""She said the words in a tone so bitter, so hollow, that they stifled theremonstrances of my passion.""You uttered cries that day beneath the walnut-tree; I have uttered mycries here beneath these alders, that is all,"" I said; ""I will be silenthenceforth.""""Your generosity shames me,"" she said, raising her eyes to heaven.We reached the terrace and found the count sitting in a chair, in thesun. The sight of that sunken face, scarcely brightened by a feeblesmile, extinguished the last flames that came from the ashes. I leanedagainst the balustrade and considered the picture of that poor wreck,between his sickly children and his wife, pale with her vigils, wornout by extreme fatigue, by the fears, perhaps also by the joys of theseterrible months, but whose cheeks now glowed from the emotions she hadjust passed through. At the sight of that suffering family beneath thetrembling leafage through which the gray light of a cloudy autumn skycame dimly, I felt within me a rupture of the bonds which hold the bodyto the spirit. There came upon me then that moral spleen which, theysay, the strongest wrestlers know in the crisis of their combats, aspecies of cold madness which makes a coward of the bravest man, a bigotof an unbeliever, and renders those it grasps indifferent to all things,even to vital sentiments, to honor, to love--for the doubt it bringstakes from us the knowledge of ourselves and disgusts us with lifeitself. Poor, nervous creatures, whom the very richness of yourorganization delivers over to this mysterious, fatal power, who are yourpeers and who your judges? Horrified by the thoughts that rose withinme, and demanding, like the wicked man, ""Where is now thy God?"" I couldnot restrain the tears that rolled down my cheeks.""What is it, dear Felix?"" said Madeleine in her childish voice.Then Henriette put to flight these dark horrors of the mind by a look oftender solicitude which shone into my soul like a sunbeam. Just then theold huntsman brought me a letter from Tours, at sight of which I made asudden cry of surprise, which made Madame de Mortsauf tremble. I saw theking\'s signet and knew it contained my recall. I gave her the letter andshe read it at a glance.""What will become of me?"" she murmured, beholding her desert sunless.We fell into a stupor of thought which oppressed us equally; neverhad we felt more strongly how necessary we were to one another. Thecountess, even when she spoke indifferently of other things, seemed tohave a new voice, as if the instrument had lost some chords and otherswere out of tune. Her movements were apathetic, her eyes without light.I begged her to tell me her thoughts.""Have I any?"" she replied in a dazed way.She drew me into her chamber, made me sit upon the sofa, took a packagefrom the drawer of her dressing-table, and knelt before me, saying:""This hair has fallen from my head during the last year; take it, it isyours; you will some day know how and why.""Slowly I bent to meet her brow, and she did not avoid my lips. I kissedher sacredly, without unworthy passion, without one impure impulse, butsolemnly, with tenderness. Was she willing to make the sacrifice; or didshe merely come, as I did once, to the verge of the precipice? If lovewere leading her to give herself could she have worn that calm, thatholy look; would she have asked, in that pure voice of hers, ""You arenot angry with me, are you?""I left that evening; she wished to accompany me on the road to Frapesle;and we stopped under my walnut-tree. I showed it to her, and told herhow I had first seen her four years earlier from that spot. ""The valleywas so beautiful then!"" I cried.""And now?"" she said quickly.""You are beneath my tree, and the valley is ours!""She bowed her head and that was our farewell; she got into her carriagewith Madeleine, and I into mine alone.On my return to Paris I was absorbed in pressing business which tookall my time and kept me out of society, which for a while forgot me.I corresponded with Madame de Mortsauf, and sent her my journal once aweek. She answered twice a month. It was a life of solitude yet teeming,like those sequestered spots, blooming unknown, which I had sometimesfound in the depths of woods when gathering the flowers for my poems.Oh, you who love! take these obligations on you; accept these dailyduties, like those the Church imposes upon Christians. The rigorousobservances of the Roman faith contain a great idea; they plough thefurrow of duty in the soul by the daily repetition of acts which keepalive the sense of hope and fear. Sentiments flow clearer in furrowedchannels which purify their stream; they refresh the heart, theyfertilize the life from the abundant treasures of a hidden faith, thesource divine in which the single thought of a single love is multipliedindefinitely.My love, an echo of the Middle Ages and of chivalry, was known, I knownot how; possibly the king and the Duc de Lenoncourt had spoken of it.From that upper sphere the romantic yet simple story of a young manpiously adoring a beautiful woman remote from the world, noble in hersolitude, faithful without support to duty, spread, no doubt quickly,through the faubourg St. Germain. In the salons I was the object ofembarrassing notice; for retired life has advantages which ifonce experienced make the burden of a constant social intercourseinsupportable. Certain minds are painfully affected by violentcontrasts, just as eyes accustomed to soft colors are hurt by glaringlight. This was my condition then; you may be surprised at it now, buthave patience; the inconsistencies of the Vandenesse of to-day will beexplained to you.I found society courteous and women most kind. After the marriage of theDuc de Berry the court resumed its former splendor and the glory ofthe French fetes revived. The Allied occupation was over, prosperityreappeared, enjoyments were again possible. Noted personages,illustrious by rank, prominent by fortune, came from all parts of Europeto the capital of the intellect, where the merits and the vices ofother countries were found magnified and whetted by the charms of Frenchintellect.Five months after leaving Clochegourde my good angel wrote me, in themiddle of the winter, a despairing letter, telling me of the seriousillness of her son. He was then out of danger, but there were many fearsfor the future; the doctor said that precautions were necessary forhis lungs--the suggestion of a terrible idea which had put the mother\'sheart in mourning. Hardly had Jacques begun to convalesce, and she couldbreathe again, when Madeleine made them all uneasy. That pretty plant,whose bloom had lately rewarded the mother\'s culture, was now frailand pallid and anemic. The countess, worn-out by Jacques\' long illness,found no courage, she said, to bear this additional blow, and theever present spectacle of these two dear failing creatures made herinsensible to the redoubled torment of her husband\'s temper. Thus thestorms were again raging; tearing up by the roots the hopes that wereplanted deepest in her bosom. She was now at the mercy of the count;weary of the struggle, she allowed him to regain all the ground he hadlost.""When all my strength is employed in caring for my children,"" she wrote,""how is it possible to employ it against Monsieur de Mortsauf; how canI struggle against his aggressions when I am fighting against death?Standing here to-day, alone and much enfeebled, between these two youngimages of mournful fate, I am overpowered with disgust, invincibledisgust for life. What blow can I feel, to what affection can I answer,when I see Jacques motionless on the terrace, scarcely a sign of lifeabout him, except in those dear eyes, large by emaciation, hollow asthose of an old man and, oh, fatal sign, full of precocious intelligencecontrasting with his physical debility. When I look at my prettyMadeleine, once so gay, so caressing, so blooming, now white as death,her very hair and eyes seem to me to have paled; she turns a languishinglook upon me as if bidding me farewell; nothing rouses her, nothingtempts her. In spite of all my efforts I cannot amuse my children; theysmile at me, but their smile is only in answer to my endearments, itdoes not come from them. They weep because they have no strength to playwith me. Suffering has enfeebled their whole being, it has loosened eventhe ties that bound them to me.""Thus you can well believe that Clochegourde is very sad. Monsieur deMortsauf now rules everything--Oh my friend! you, my glory!"" she wrote,farther on, ""you must indeed love me well to love me still; to love mecallous, ungrateful, turned to stone by grief.""']",5,18,36475,179373,lili valley ii first lovethi scene took place tuesday wait sunday notcross river five day great event happen atclochegourd count receiv brevet gener brigad thecross saint
