79.0,The Hidden Masterpiece,2.0,"['IOn a cold morning in December, towards the close of the year 1612, ayoung man, whose clothing betrayed his poverty, was standing before thedoor of a house in the Rue des Grands-Augustine, in Paris. After walkingto and fro for some time with the hesitation of a lover who fearsto approach his mistress, however complying she may be, he ended bycrossing the threshold and asking if Maitre Francois Porbus were within.At the affirmative answer of an old woman who was sweeping out one ofthe lower rooms the young man slowly mounted the stairway, stopping fromtime to time and hesitating, like a newly fledged courier doubtful as towhat sort of reception the king might grant him.When he reached the upper landing of the spiral ascent, he paused amoment before laying hold of a grotesque knocker which ornamented thedoor of the atelier where the famous painter of Henry IV.--neglected byMarie de Medicis for Rubens--was probably at work. The young man feltthe strong sensation which vibrates in the soul of great artists when,in the flush of youth and of their ardor for art, they approach a man ofgenius or a masterpiece. In all human sentiments there are, as it were,primeval flowers bred of noble enthusiasms, which droop and fade fromyear to year, till joy is but a memory and glory a lie. Amid suchfleeting emotions nothing so resembles love as the young passion of anartist who tastes the first delicious anguish of his destined fame andwoe,--a passion daring yet timid, full of vague confidence and surediscouragement. Is there a man, slender in fortune, rich in hisspring-time of genius, whose heart has not beaten loudly as heapproached a master of his art? If there be, that man will forever lacksome heart-string, some touch, I know not what, of his brush, somefibre in his creations, some sentiment in his poetry. When braggarts,self-satisfied and in love with themselves, step early into the famewhich belongs rightly to their future achievements, they are menof genius only in the eyes of fools. If talent is to be measured byyouthful shyness, by that indefinable modesty which men born to glorylose in the practice of their art, as a pretty woman loses hers amongthe artifices of coquetry, then this unknown young man might claim tobe possessed of genuine merit. The habit of success lessens doubt; andmodesty, perhaps, is doubt.Worn down with poverty and discouragement, and dismayed at this momentby his own presumption, the young neophyte might not have dared to enterthe presence of the master to whom we owe our admirable portrait ofHenry IV., if chance had not thrown an unexpected assistance in his way.An old man mounted the spiral stairway. The oddity of his dress, themagnificence of his lace ruffles, the solid assurance of his deliberatestep, led the youth to assume that this remarkable personage must be thepatron, or at least the intimate friend, of the painter. He drew backinto a corner of the landing and made room for the new-comer; looking athim attentively and hoping to find either the frank good-nature ofthe artistic temperament, or the serviceable disposition of thosewho promote the arts. But on the contrary he fancied he saw somethingdiabolical in the expression of the old man\'s face,--something, I knownot what, which has the quality of alluring the artistic mind.Imagine a bald head, the brow full and prominent and falling with deepprojection over a little flattened nose turned up at the end like thenoses of Rabelais and Socrates; a laughing, wrinkled mouth; a shortchin boldly chiselled and garnished with a gray beard cut into a point;sea-green eyes, faded perhaps by age, but whose pupils, contrastingwith the pearl-white balls on which they floated, cast at timesmagnetic glances of anger or enthusiasm. The face in other respectswas singularly withered and worn by the weariness of old age, and stillmore, it would seem, by the action of thoughts which had undermined bothsoul and body. The eyes had lost their lashes, and the eyebrows werescarcely traced along the projecting arches where they belonged. Imaginesuch a head upon a lean and feeble body, surround it with lace ofdazzling whiteness worked in meshes like a fish-slice, festoon the blackvelvet doublet of the old man with a heavy gold chain, and you willhave a faint idea of the exterior of this strange individual, to whoseappearance the dusky light of the landing lent fantastic coloring. Youmight have thought that a canvas of Rembrandt without its frame hadwalked silently up the stairway, bringing with it the dark atmospherewhich was the sign-manual of the great master. The old man cast a lookupon the youth which was full of sagacity; then he rapped three timesupon the door, and said, when it was opened by a man in feeble health,apparently about forty years of age, ""Good-morning, maitre.""Porbus bowed respectfully, and made way for his guest, allowing theyouth to pass in at the same time, under the impression that he camewith the old man, and taking no further notice of him; all the lessperhaps because the neophyte stood still beneath the spell which holds aheaven-born painter as he sees for the first time an atelier filled withthe materials and instruments of his art. Daylight came from a casementin the roof and fell, focussed as it were, upon a canvas which rested onan easel in the middle of the room, and which bore, as yet, only threeor four chalk lines. The light thus concentrated did not reach the darkangles of the vast atelier; but a few wandering reflections gleamedthrough the russet shadows on the silvered breastplate of a horseman\'scuirass of the fourteenth century as it hung from the wall, or sentsharp lines of light upon the carved and polished cornice of a dresserwhich held specimens of rare pottery and porcelains, or touched withsparkling points the rough-grained texture of ancient gold-brocadedcurtains, flung in broad folds about the room to serve the painteras models for his drapery. Anatomical casts in plaster, fragmentsand torsos of antique goddesses amorously polished by the kisses ofcenturies, jostled each other upon shelves and brackets. Innumerablesketches, studies in the three crayons, in ink, and in red chalkcovered the walls from floor to ceiling; color-boxes, bottles of oil andturpentine, easels and stools upset or standing at right angles, leftbut a narrow pathway to the circle of light thrown from the window inthe roof, which fell full on the pale face of Porbus and on the ivoryskull of his singular visitor.The attention of the young man was taken exclusively by a picturedestined to become famous after those days of tumult and revolution,and which even then was precious in the sight of certain opinionatedindividuals to whom we owe the preservation of the divine afflatusthrough the dark days when the life of art was in jeopardy. This noblepicture represents the Mary of Egypt as she prepares to pay for herpassage by the ship. It is a masterpiece, painted for Marie de Medicis,and afterwards sold by her in the days of her distress.""I like your saint,"" said the old man to Porbus, ""and I will give youten golden crowns over and above the queen\'s offer; but as to enteringinto competition with her--the devil!""""You do like her, then?""""As for that,"" said the old man, ""yes, and no. The good woman is wellset-up, but--she is not living. You young men think you have done allwhen you have drawn the form correctly, and put everything inplace according to the laws of anatomy. You color the features withflesh-tones, mixed beforehand on your palette,--taking very good care toshade one side of the face darker than the other; and because you drawnow and then from a nude woman standing on a table, you think you cancopy nature; you fancy yourselves painters, and imagine that you havegot at the secret of God\'s creations! Pr-r-r-r!--To be a great poet itis not enough to know the rules of syntax and write faultless grammar.Look at your saint, Porbus. At first sight she is admirable; but at thevery next glance we perceive that she is glued to the canvas, and thatwe cannot walk round her. She is a silhouette with only one side,a semblance cut in outline, an image that can\'t turn nor change herposition. I feel no air between this arm and the background of thepicture; space and depth are wanting. All is in good perspective; theatmospheric gradations are carefully observed, and yet in spite of yourconscientious labor I cannot believe that this beautiful body has thewarm breath of life. If I put my hand on that firm, round throat I shallfind it cold as marble. No, no, my friend, blood does not run beneaththat ivory skin; the purple tide of life does not swell those veins, norstir those fibres which interlace like net-work below the translucentamber of the brow and breast. This part palpitates with life, but thatother part is not living; life and death jostle each other in everydetail. Here, you have a woman; there, a statue; here again, a deadbody. Your creation is incomplete. You have breathed only a part of yoursoul into the well-beloved work. The torch of Prometheus went out inyour hands over and over again; there are several parts of your paintingon which the celestial flame never shone.""""But why is it so, my dear master?"" said Porbus humbly, while the youngman could hardly restrain a strong desire to strike the critic.""Ah! that is the question,"" said the little old man. ""You are floatingbetween two systems,--between drawing and color, between the patientphlegm and honest stiffness of the old Dutch masters and the dazzlingwarmth and abounding joy of the Italians. You have tried to follow, atone and the same time, Hans Holbein and Titian; Albrecht Durier andPaul Veronese. Well, well! it was a glorious ambition, but what isthe result? You have neither the stern attraction of severity nor thedeceptive magic of the chiaroscuro. See! at this place the rich, clearcolor of Titian has forced out the skeleton outline of Albrecht Durier,as molten bronze might burst and overflow a slender mould. Here andthere the outline has resisted the flood, and holds back the magnificenttorrent of Venetian color. Your figure is neither perfectly wellpainted nor perfectly well drawn; it bears throughout the signs of thisunfortunate indecision. If you did not feel that the fire of your geniuswas hot enough to weld into one the rival methods, you ought to havechosen honestly the one or the other, and thus attained the unity whichconveys one aspect, at least, of life. As it is, you are true onlyon your middle plane. Your outlines are false; they do not round uponthemselves; they suggest nothing behind them. There is truth here,"" saidthe old man, pointing to the bosom of the saint; ""and here,"" showing thespot where the shoulder ended against the background; ""but there,"" headded, returning to the throat, ""it is all false. Do not inquire intothe why and wherefore. I should fill you with despair.""The old man sat down on a stool and held his head in his hands for someminutes in silence.""Master,"" said Porbus at length, ""I studied that throat from the nude;but, to our sorrow, there are effects in nature which become false orimpossible when placed on canvas.""""The mission of art is not to copy nature, but to represent it. Youare not an abject copyist, but a poet,"" cried the old man, hastilyinterrupting Porbus with a despotic gesture. ""If it were not so, asculptor could reach the height of his art by merely moulding awoman. Try to mould the hand of your mistress, and see what you willget,--ghastly articulations, without the slightest resemblance to herliving hand; you must have recourse to the chisel of a man who, withoutservilely copying that hand, can give it movement and life. It is ourmission to seize the mind, soul, countenance of things and beings.Effects! effects! what are they? the mere accidents of the life, and notthe life itself. A hand,--since I have taken that as an example,--ahand is not merely a part of the body, it is far more; it expresses andcarries on a thought which we must seize and render. Neither the painternor the poet nor the sculptor should separate the effect from the cause,for they are indissolubly one. The true struggle of art lies there. Manya painter has triumphed through instinct without knowing this theory ofart as a theory.""Yes,"" continued the old man vehemently, ""you draw a woman, but you donot _see_ her. That is not the way to force an entrance into the arcanaof Nature. Your hand reproduces, without an action of your mind, themodel you copied under a master. You do not search out the secretsof form, nor follow its windings and evolutions with enough love andperseverance. Beauty is solemn and severe, and cannot be attained inthat way; we must wait and watch its times and seasons, and clasp itfirmly ere it yields to us. Form is a Proteus less easily captured, moreskilful to double and escape, than the Proteus of fable; it is onlyat the cost of struggle that we compel it to come forth in its trueaspects. You young men are content with the first glimpse you get of it;or, at any rate, with the second or the third. This is not the spiritof the great warriors of art,--invincible powers, not misled bywill-o\'-the-wisps, but advancing always until they force Nature to liebare in her divine integrity. That was Raphael\'s method,"" said the oldman, lifting his velvet cap in homage to the sovereign of art; ""hissuperiority came from the inward essence which seems to break from theinner to the outer of his figures. Form with him was what it is withus,--a medium by which to communicate ideas, sensations, feelings; inshort, the infinite poesy of being. Every figure is a world; a portrait,whose original stands forth like a sublime vision, colored with therainbow tints of light, drawn by the monitions of an inward voice, laidbare by a divine finger which points to the past of its whole existenceas the source of its given expression. You clothe your women withdelicate skins and glorious draperies of hair, but where is the bloodwhich begets the passion or the peace of their souls, and is the causeof what you call \'effects\'? Your saint is a dark woman; but this, mypoor Porbus, belongs to a fair one. Your figures are pale, coloredphantoms, which you present to our eyes; and you call that painting!art! Because you make something which looks more like a woman than ahouse, you think you have touched the goal; proud of not being obligedto write ""currus venustus"" or ""pulcher homo"" on the frame of yourpicture, you think yourselves majestic artists like our greatforefathers. Ha, ha! you have not got there yet, my little men; youwill use up many a crayon and spoil many a canvas before you reach thatheight. Undoubtedly a woman carries her head this way and her petticoatsthat way; her eyes soften and droop with just that look of resignedgentleness; the throbbing shadow of the eyelashes falls exactly thusupon her cheek. That is it, and--that is _not it_. What lacks? A merenothing; but that mere nothing is _all_. You have given the shadow oflife, but you have not given its fulness, its being, its--I know notwhat--soul, perhaps, which floats vaporously about the tabernacle offlesh; in short, that flower of life which Raphael and Titian culled.Start from the point you have now attained, and perhaps you may yetpaint a worthy picture; you grew weary too soon. Mediocrity will extolyour work; but the true artist smiles. O Mabuse! O my master!"" addedthis singular person, ""you were a thief; you have robbed us of yourlife, your knowledge, your art! But at least,"" he resumed after a pause,""this picture is better than the paintings of that rascally Rubens, withhis mountains of Flemish flesh daubed with vermilion, his cascades ofred hair, and his hurly-burly of color. At any rate, you have got theelements of color, drawing, and sentiment,--the three essential parts ofart.""""But the saint is sublime, good sir!"" cried the young man in a loudvoice, waking from a deep reverie. ""These figures, the saint and theboatman, have a subtile meaning which the Italian painters cannot give.I do not know one of them who could have invented that hesitation of theboatman.""""Does the young fellow belong to you?"" asked Porbus of the old man.""Alas, maitre, forgive my boldness,"" said the neophyte, blushing. ""I amall unknown; only a dauber by instinct. I have just come to Paris, thatfountain of art and science.""""Let us see what you can do,"" said Porbus, giving him a red crayon and apiece of paper.The unknown copied the saint with an easy turn of his hand.""Oh! oh!"" exclaimed the old man, ""what is your name?""The youth signed the drawing: Nicolas Poussin.""Not bad for a beginner,"" said the strange being who had discoursed sowildly. ""I see that it is worth while to talk art before you. I don\'tblame you for admiring Porbus\'s saint. It is a masterpiece for the worldat large; only those who are behind the veil of the holy of holies canperceive its errors. But you are worthy of a lesson, and capable ofunderstanding it. I will show you how little is needed to turn thatpicture into a true masterpiece. Give all your eyes and all yourattention; such a chance of instruction may never fall in your wayagain. Your palette, Porbus.""Porbus fetched his palette and brushes. The little old man turned uphis cuffs with convulsive haste, slipped his thumb through the palettecharged with prismatic colors, and snatched, rather than took, thehandful of brushes which Porbus held out to him. As he did so his beard,cut to a point, seemed to quiver with the eagerness of an incontinentfancy; and while he filled his brush he muttered between his teeth:--""Colors fit to fling out of the window with the man who groundthem,--crude, false, revolting! who can paint with them?""Then he dipped the point of his brush with feverish haste into thevarious tints, running through the whole scale with more rapiditythan the organist of a cathedral runs up the gamut of the ""O Filii"" atEaster.Porbus and Poussin stood motionless on either side of the easel, plungedin passionate contemplation.""See, young man,"" said the old man without turning round, ""see how withthree or four touches and a faint bluish glaze you can make the aircirculate round the head of the poor saint, who was suffocating in thatthick atmosphere. Look how the drapery now floats, and you see that thebreeze lifts it; just now it looked like heavy linen held out by pins.Observe that the satiny lustre I am putting on the bosom gives it theplump suppleness of the flesh of a young girl. See how this tone ofmingled reddish-brown and ochre warms up the cold grayness of that largeshadow where the blood seemed to stagnate rather than flow. Young man,young man! what I am showing you now no other master in the world canteach you. Mabuse alone knew the secret of giving life to form. Mabusehad but one pupil, and I am he. I never took a pupil, and I am an oldman now. You are intelligent enough to guess at what should follow fromthe little that I shall show you to-day.""While he was speaking, the extraordinary old man was giving touches hereand there to all parts of the picture. Here two strokes of the brush,there one, but each so telling that together they brought out a newpainting,--a painting steeped, as it were, in light. He worked withsuch passionate ardor that the sweat rolled in great drops from his baldbrow; and his motions seemed to be jerked out of him with such rapidityand impatience that the young Poussin fancied a demon, encased with thebody of this singular being, was working his hands fantastically likethose of a puppet without, or even against, the will of their owner. Theunnatural brightness of his eyes, the convulsive movements which seemedthe result of some mental resistance, gave to this fancy of the youtha semblance of truth which reacted upon his lively imagination. The oldman worked on, muttering half to himself, half to his neophyte:--""Paf! paf! paf! that is how we butter it on, young man. Ah! my littlepats, you are right; warm up that icy tone. Come, come!--pon, pon,pon,--"" he continued, touching up the spots where he had complained of alack of life, hiding under layers of color the conflicting methods, andregaining the unity of tone essential to an ardent Egyptian.""Now see, my little friend, it is only the last touches of the brushthat count for anything. Porbus put on a hundred; I have only put on oneor two. Nobody will thank us for what is underneath, remember that!""At last the demon paused; the old man turned to Porbus and Poussin, whostood mute with admiration, and said to them,--""It is not yet equal to my Beautiful Nut-girl; still, one can put one\'sname to such a work. Yes, I will sign it,"" he added, rising to fetcha mirror in which to look at what he had done. ""Now let us go andbreakfast. Come, both of you, to my house. I have some smoked ham andgood wine. Hey! hey! in spite of the degenerate times we will talkpainting; we are strong ourselves. Here is a little man,"" he continued,striking Nicolas Poussin on the shoulder, ""who has the faculty.""Observing the shabby cap of the youth, he pulled from his belt aleathern purse from which he took two gold pieces and offered them tohim, saying,--""I buy your drawing.""""Take them,"" said Porbus to Poussin, seeing that the latter trembledand blushed with shame, for the young scholar had the pride of poverty;""take them, he has the ransom of two kings in his pouch.""The three left the atelier and proceeded, talking all the way of art,to a handsome wooden house standing near the Pont Saint-Michel, whosewindow-casings and arabesque decoration amazed Poussin. The embryopainter soon found himself in one of the rooms on the ground floorseated, beside a good fire, at a table covered with appetizing dishes,and, by unexpected good fortune, in company with two great artists whotreated him with kindly attention.""Young man,"" said Porbus, observing that he was speechless, with hiseyes fixed on a picture, ""do not look at that too long, or you will fallinto despair.""It was the Adam of Mabuse, painted by that wayward genius to enable himto get out of the prison where his creditors had kept him so long. Thefigure presented such fulness and force of reality that Nicolas Poussinbegan to comprehend the meaning of the bewildering talk of the old man.The latter looked at the picture with a satisfied but not enthusiasticmanner, which seemed to say, ""I have done better myself.""""There is life in the form,"" he remarked. ""My poor master surpassedhimself there; but observe the want of truth in the background. Theman is living, certainly; he rises and is coming towards us; but theatmosphere, the sky, the air that we breathe, see, feel,--where arethey? Besides, that is only a man; and the being who came first fromthe hand of God must needs have had something divine about him whichis lacking here. Mabuse said so himself with vexation in his sobermoments.""Poussin looked alternately at the old man and at Porbus with uneasycuriosity. He turned to the latter as if to ask the name of their host,but the painter laid a finger on his lips with an air of mystery, andthe young man, keenly interested, kept silence, hoping that sooner orlater some word of the conversation might enable him to guess the nameof the old man, whose wealth and genius were sufficiently attested bythe respect which Porbus showed him, and by the marvels of art heapedtogether in the picturesque apartment.Poussin, observing against the dark panelling of the wall a magnificentportrait of a woman, exclaimed aloud, ""What a magnificent Giorgione!""""No,"" remarked the old man, ""that is only one of my early daubs.""""Zounds!"" cried Poussin naively; ""are you the king of painters?""The old man smiled, as if long accustomed to such homage. ""MaitreFrenhofer,"" said Porbus, ""could you order up a little of your good Rhinewine for me?""""Two casks,"" answered the host; ""one to pay for the pleasure oflooking at your pretty sinner this morning, and the other as a mark offriendship.""""Ah! if I were not so feeble,"" resumed Porbus, ""and if you would consentto let me see your Beautiful Nut-girl, I too could paint some loftypicture, grand and yet profound, where the forms should have the livinglife.""""Show my work!"" exclaimed the old man, with deep emotion. ""No, no! Ihave still to bring it to perfection. Yesterday, towards evening, Ithought it was finished. Her eyes were liquid, her flesh trembled, hertresses waved--she breathed! And yet, though I have grasped the secretof rendering on a flat canvas the relief and roundness of nature, thismorning at dawn I saw many errors. Ah! to attain that glorious result,I have studied to their depths the masters of color. I have analyzed andlifted, layer by layer, the colors of Titian, king of light. Like him,great sovereign of art, I have sketched my figure in light clear tonesof supple yet solid color; for shadow is but an accident,--rememberthat, young man. Then I worked backward, as it were; and by means ofhalf-tints, and glazings whose transparency I kept diminishing little bylittle, I was able to cast strong shadows deepening almost to blackness.The shadows of ordinary painters are not of the same texture as theirtones of light. They are wood, brass, iron, anything you please exceptflesh in shadow. We feel that if the figures changed position the shadyplaces would not be wiped off, and would remain dark spots which nevercould be made luminous. I have avoided that blunder, though many of ourmost illustrious painters have fallen into it. In my work you will seewhiteness beneath the opacity of the broadest shadow. Unlike the crowdof ignoramuses, who fancy they draw correctly because they can paint onegood vanishing line, I have not dryly outlined my figures, nor broughtout superstitiously minute anatomical details; for, let me tell you, thehuman body does not end off with a line. In that respect sculptors getnearer to the truth of nature than we do. Nature is all curves, eachwrapping or overlapping another. To speak rigorously, there is no suchthing as drawing. Do not laugh, young man; no matter how strange thatsaying seems to you, you will understand the reasons for it one of thesedays. A line is a means by which man explains to himself the effectof light upon a given object; but there is no such thing as a line innature, where all things are rounded and full. It is only in modellingthat we really draw,--in other words, that we detach things from theirsurroundings and put them in their due relief. The proper distributionof light can alone reveal the whole body. For this reason I do notsharply define lineaments; I diffuse about their outline a haze of warm,light half-tints, so that I defy any one to place a finger on the exactspot where the parts join the groundwork of the picture. If seen nearby this sort of work has a woolly effect, and is wanting in nicety andprecision; but go a few steps off and the parts fall into place; theytake their proper form and detach themselves,--the body turns, the limbsstand out, we feel the air circulating around them.""Nevertheless,"" he continued, sadly, ""I am not satisfied; there aremoments when I have my doubts. Perhaps it would be better not to sketcha single line. I ask myself if I ought not to grasp the figure first byits highest lights, and then work down to the darker portions. Is notthat the method of the sun, divine painter of the universe? O Nature,Nature! who has ever caught thee in thy flights? Alas! the heights ofknowledge, like the depths of ignorance, lead to unbelief. I doubt mywork.""The old man paused, then resumed. ""For ten years I have worked, youngman; but what are ten short years in the long struggle with Nature? Wedo not know the type it cost Pygmalion to make the only statue that everwalked--""He fell into a reverie and remained, with fixed eyes, oblivious of allabout him, playing mechanically with his knife.""See, he is talking to his own soul,"" said Porbus in a low voice.The words acted like a spell on Nicolas Poussin, filling him with theinexplicable curiosity of a true artist. The strange old man, with hiswhite eyes fixed in stupor, became to the wondering youth something morethan a man; he seemed a fantastic spirit inhabiting an unknown sphere,and waking by its touch confused ideas within the soul. We can no moredefine the moral phenomena of this species of fascination than we canrender in words the emotions excited in the heart of an exile by a songwhich recalls his fatherland. The contempt which the old man affectedto pour upon the noblest efforts of art, his wealth, his manners,the respectful deference shown to him by Porbus, his work guarded sosecretly,--a work of patient toil, a work no doubt of genius, judging bythe head of the Virgin which Poussin had so naively admired, and which,beautiful beside even the Adam of Mabuse, betrayed the imperial touch ofa great artist,--in short, everything about the strange old man seemedbeyond the limits of human nature. The rich imagination of the youthfastened upon the one perceptible and clear clew to the mystery of thissupernatural being,--the presence of the artistic nature, that wildimpassioned nature to which such mighty powers have been confided, whichtoo often abuses those powers, and drags cold reason and common souls,and even lovers of art, over stony and arid places, where for suchthere is neither pleasure nor instruction; while to the artistic soulitself,--that white-winged angel of sportive fancy,--epics, works ofart, and visions rise along the way. It is a nature, an essence, mockingyet kind, fruitful though destitute. Thus, for the enthusiastic Poussin,the old man became by sudden transfiguration Art itself,--art with allits secrets, its transports, and its dreams.""Yes, my dear Porbus,"" said Frenhofer, speaking half in reverie, ""I havenever yet beheld a perfect woman; a body whose outlines were faultlessand whose flesh-tints--Ah! where lives she?"" he cried, interrupting hisown words; ""where lives the lost Venus of the ancients, so long soughtfor, whose scattered beauty we snatch by glimpses? Oh! to see for amoment, a single moment, the divine completed nature,--the ideal,--Iwould give my all of fortune. Yes; I would search thee out, celestialBeauty! in thy farthest sphere. Like Orpheus, I would go down to hell towin back the life of art--""""Let us go,"" said Porbus to Poussin; ""he neither sees nor hears us anylonger.""""Let us go to his atelier,"" said the wonder-struck young man.""Oh! the old dragon has guarded the entrance. His treasure is out of ourreach. I have not waited for your wish or urging to attempt an assaulton the mystery.""""Mystery! then there is a mystery?""""Yes,"" answered Porbus. ""Frenhofer was the only pupil Mabuse was willingto teach. He became the friend, saviour, father of that unhappy man, andhe sacrificed the greater part of his wealth to satisfy the mad passionsof his master. In return, Mabuse bequeathed to him the secret of relief,the power of giving life to form,--that flower of nature, our perpetualdespair, which Mabuse had seized so well that once, having sold anddrunk the value of a flowered damask which he should have worn atthe entrance of Charles V., he made his appearance in a paper garmentpainted to resemble damask. The splendor of the stuff attracted theattention of the emperor, who, wishing to compliment the old drunkard,laid a hand upon his shoulder and discovered the deception. Frenhofer isa man carried away by the passion of his art; he sees above and beyondwhat other painters see. He has meditated deeply on color and theabsolute truth of lines; but by dint of much research, much thought,much study, he has come to doubt the object for which he is searching.In his hours of despair he fancies that drawing does not exist, and thatlines can render nothing but geometric figures. That, of course, is nottrue; because with a black line which has no color we can representthe human form. This proves that our art is made up, like nature, of aninfinite number of elements. Drawing gives the skeleton, and color givesthe life; but life without the skeleton is a far more incompletething than the skeleton without the life. But there is a higher truthstill,--namely, that practice and observation are the essentials ofa painter; and that if reason and poesy persist in wrangling with thetools, the brushes, we shall be brought to doubt, like Frenhofer, whois as much excited in brain as he is exalted in art. A sublime painter,indeed; but he had the misfortune to be born rich, and that enables himto stray into theory and conjecture. Do not imitate him. Work! work!painters should theorize with their brushes in their hands.""""We will contrive to get in,"" cried Poussin, not listening to Porbus,and thinking only of the hidden masterpiece.Porbus smiled at the youth\'s enthusiasm, and bade him farewell with akindly invitation to come and visit him.              *     *     *     *     *Nicolas Poussin returned slowly towards the Rue de la Harpe and passed,without observing that he did so, the modest hostelry where he waslodging. Returning presently upon his steps, he ran up the miserablestairway with anxious rapidity until he reached an upper chambernestling between the joists of a roof ""en colombage,""--the plain, slightcovering of the houses of old Paris. Near the single and gloomy windowof the room sat a young girl, who rose quickly as the door opened, witha gesture of love; she had recognized the young man\'s touch upon thelatch.""What is the matter?"" she asked.""It is--it is,"" he cried, choking with joy, ""that I feel myself apainter! I have doubted it till now; but to-day I believe in myself. Ican be a great man. Ah, Gillette, we shall be rich, happy! There is goldin these brushes!""Suddenly he became silent. His grave and earnest face lost itsexpression of joy; he was comparing the immensity of his hopes with themediocrity of his means. The walls of the garret were covered with bitsof paper on which were crayon sketches; he possessed only four cleancanvases. Colors were at that time costly, and the poor gentleman gazedat a palette that was well-nigh bare. In the midst of this povertyhe felt within himself an indescribable wealth of heart and thesuperabundant force of consuming genius. Brought to Paris by a gentlemanof his acquaintance, and perhaps by the monition of his own talent, hehad suddenly found a mistress,--one of those generous and noble soulswho are ready to suffer by the side of a great man; espousing hispoverty, studying to comprehend his caprices, strong to bear deprivationand bestow love, as others are daring in the display of luxury and inparading the insensibility of their hearts. The smile which flickered onher lips brightened as with gold the darkness of the garret and rivalledthe effulgence of the skies; for the sun did not always shine in theheavens, but she was always here,--calm and collected in her passion,living in his happiness, his griefs; sustaining the genius whichoverflowed in love ere it found in art its destined expression.""Listen, Gillette; come!""The obedient, happy girl sprang lightly on the painter\'s knee. She wasall grace and beauty, pretty as the spring-time, decked with the wealthof feminine charm, and lighting all with the fire of a noble soul.""O God!"" he exclaimed, ""I can never tell her!""""A secret!"" she cried; ""then I must know it.""Poussin was lost in thought.""Tell me.""""Gillette, poor, beloved heart!""""Ah! do you want something of me?""""Yes.""""If you want me to pose as I did the other day,"" she said, with a littlepouting air, ""I will not do it. Your eyes say nothing to me, then. Youlook at me, but you do not think of me.""""Would you like me to copy another woman?""""Perhaps,"" she answered, ""if she were very ugly.""""Well,"" continued Poussin, in a grave tone, ""if to make me a greatpainter it were necessary to pose to some one else--""""You are testing me,"" she interrupted; ""you know well that I would notdo it.""Poussin bent his head upon his breast like a man succumbing to joy orgrief too great for his spirit to bear.""Listen,"" she said, pulling him by the sleeve of his worn doublet,""I told you, Nick, that I would give my life for you; but I neversaid--never!--that I, a living woman, would renounce my love.""""Renounce it?"" cried Poussin.""If I showed myself thus to another you would love me no longer; and Imyself, I should feel unworthy of your love. To obey your caprices, ah,that is simple and natural! in spite of myself, I am proud and happy indoing thy dear will; but to another, fy!""""Forgive me, my own Gillette,"" said the painter, throwing himself at herfeet. ""I would rather be loved than famous. To me thou art more preciousthan fortune and honors. Yes, away with these brushes! burn thosesketches! I have been mistaken. My vocation is to love thee,--theealone! I am not a painter, I am thy lover. Perish art and all itssecrets!""She looked at him admiringly, happy and captivated by his passion. Shereigned; she felt instinctively that the arts were forgotten for hersake, and flung at her feet like grains of incense.""Yet he is only an old man,"" resumed Poussin. ""In you he would see onlya woman. You are the perfect woman whom he seeks.""""Love should grant all things!"" she exclaimed, ready to sacrifice love\'sscruples to reward the lover who thus seemed to sacrifice his art toher. ""And yet,"" she added, ""it would be my ruin. Ah, to suffer for thygood! Yes, it is glorious! But thou wilt forget me. How came this cruelthought into thy mind?""""It came there, and yet I love thee,"" he said, with a sort ofcontrition. ""Am I, then, a wretch?""""Let us consult Pere Hardouin.""""No, no! it must be a secret between us.""""Well, I will go; but thou must not be present,"" she said. ""Stay at thedoor, armed with thy dagger. If I cry out, enter and kill the man.""Forgetting all but his art, Poussin clasped her in his arms.""He loves me no longer!"" thought Gillette, when she was once more alone.She regretted her promise. But before long she fell a prey to an anguishfar more cruel than her regret; and she struggled vainly to drive fortha terrible fear which forced its way into her mind. She felt that sheloved him less as the suspicion rose in her heart that he was lessworthy than she had thought him.']",3.0,20.0,6362.0,31835.0,hidden masterpiec ion cold morn decemb toward close year

79.0,The Hidden Masterpiece,3.0,"['IIThree months after the first meeting of Porbus and Poussin, the formerwent to see Maitre Frenhofer. He found the old man a prey to one ofthose deep, self-developed discouragements, whose cause, if we are tobelieve the mathematicians of health, lies in a bad digestion, in thewind, in the weather, in some swelling of the intestines, or else,according to casuists, in the imperfections of our moral nature; thefact being that the good man was simply worn out by the effort tocomplete his mysterious picture. He was seated languidly in a largeoaken chair of vast dimensions covered with black leather; and withoutchanging his melancholy attitude he cast on Porbus the distant glance ofa man sunk in absolute dejection.""Well, maitre,"" said Porbus, ""was the distant ultra-marine, for whichyou journeyed to Brussels, worthless? Are you unable to grind a newwhite? Is the oil bad, or the brushes restive?""""Alas!"" cried the old man, ""I thought for one moment that my work wasaccomplished; but I must have deceived myself in some of the details. Ishall have no peace until I clear up my doubts. I am about to travel;I go to Turkey, Asia, Greece, in search of models. I must compare mypicture with various types of Nature. It may be that I have up _there_,""he added, letting a smile of satisfaction flicker on his lip, ""Natureherself. At times I am half afraid that a brush may wake this woman, andthat she will disappear from sight.""He rose suddenly, as if to depart at once. ""Wait,"" exclaimed Porbus.""I have come in time to spare you the costs and fatigues of such ajourney.""""How so?"" asked Frenhofer, surprised.""Young Poussin is beloved by a woman whose incomparable beauty iswithout imperfection. But, my dear master, if he consents to lend her toyou, at least you must let us see your picture.""The old man remained standing, motionless, in a state bordering onstupefaction. ""What!"" he at last exclaimed, mournfully. ""Show mycreature, my spouse?--tear off the veil with which I have chastelyhidden my joy? It would be prostitution! For ten years I have lived withthis woman; she is mine, mine alone! she loves me! Has she not smiledupon me as, touch by touch, I painted her? She has a soul,--the soulwith which I endowed her. She would blush if other eyes than mine beheldher. Let her be seen?--where is the husband, the lover, so debased as tolend his wife to dishonor? When you paint a picture for the court you donot put your whole soul into it; you sell to courtiers your tricked-outlay-figures. My painting is not a picture; it is a sentiment, a passion!Born in my atelier, she must remain a virgin there. She shall not leaveit unclothed. Poesy and women give themselves bare, like truth, tolovers only. Have we the model of Raphael, the Angelica of Ariosto, theBeatrice of Dante? No, we see but their semblance. Well, the work whichI keep hidden behind bolts and bars is an exception to all other art. Itis not a canvas; it is a woman,--a woman with whom I weep and laughand think and talk. Would you have me resign the joy of ten years, as Imight throw away a worn-out doublet? Shall I, in a moment, cease tobe father, lover, creator?--this woman is not a creature; she is mycreation. Bring your young man; I will give him my treasures,--paintingsof Correggio, Michael-Angelo, Titian; I will kiss the print of his feetin the dust,--but make him my rival? Shame upon me! Ha! I am more alover than I am a painter. I shall have the strength to burn my Nut-girlere I render my last sigh; but suffer her to endure the glance of a man,a young man, a painter?--No, no! I would kill on the morrow the man whopolluted her with a look! I would kill you,--you, my friend,--if you didnot worship her on your knees; and think you I would submit my idol tothe cold eyes and stupid criticisms of fools? Ah, love is a mystery! itslife is in the depths of the soul; it dies when a man says, even to hisfriend, Here is she whom I love.""The old man seemed to renew his youth; his eyes had the brilliancy andfire of life, his pale cheeks blushed a vivid red, his hands trembled.Porbus, amazed by the passionate violence with which he uttered thesewords, knew not how to answer a feeling so novel and yet so profound.Was the old man under the thraldom of an artist\'s fancy? Or did theseideas flow from the unspeakable fanaticism produced at times in everymind by the long gestation of a noble work? Was it possible to bargainwith this strange and whimsical being?Filled with such thoughts, Porbus said to the old man, ""Is it not womanfor woman? Poussin lends his mistress to your eyes.""""What sort of mistress is that?"" cried Frenhofer. ""She will betray himsooner or later. Mine will be to me forever faithful.""""Well,"" returned Porbus, ""then let us say no more. But before you find,even in Asia, a woman as beautiful, as perfect, as the one I speak of,you may be dead, and your picture forever unfinished.""""Oh, it is finished!"" said Frenhofer. ""Whoever sees it will find a womanlying on a velvet bed, beneath curtains; perfumes are exhaling from agolden tripod by her side: he will be tempted to take the tassels ofthe cord that holds back the curtain; he will think he sees the bosom ofCatherine Lescaut,--a model called the Beautiful Nut-girl; he will seeit rise and fall with the movement of her breathing. Yet--I wish I couldbe sure--""""Go to Asia, then,"" said Porbus hastily, fancying he saw some hesitationin the old man\'s eye.Porbus made a few steps towards the door of the room. At this momentGillette and Nicolas Poussin reached the entrance of the house. As theyoung girl was about to enter, she dropped the arm of her lover andshrank back as if overcome by a presentiment. ""What am I doing here?""she said to Poussin, in a deep voice, looking at him fixedly.""Gillette, I leave you mistress of your actions; I will obey your will.You are my conscience, my glory. Come home; I shall be happy, perhaps,if you, yourself--""""Have I a self when you speak thus to me? Oh, no! I am but a child.Come,"" she continued, seeming to make a violent effort. ""If our loveperishes, if I put into my heart a long regret, thy fame shall bethe guerdon of my obedience to thy will. Let us enter. I may yet liveagain,--a memory on thy palette.""Opening the door of the house the two lovers met Porbus coming out.Astonished at the beauty of the young girl, whose eyes were still wetwith tears, he caught her all trembling by the hand and led her to theold master.""There!"" he cried; ""is she not worth all the masterpieces in the world?""Frenhofer quivered. Gillette stood before him in the ingenuous, simpleattitude of a young Georgian, innocent and timid, captured by brigandsand offered to a slave-merchant. A modest blush suffused her cheeks,her eyes were lowered, her hands hung at her sides, strength seemed toabandon her, and her tears protested against the violence done to herpurity. Poussin cursed himself, and repented of his folly in bringingthis treasure from their peaceful garret. Once more he became a loverrather than an artist; scruples convulsed his heart as he saw the eye ofthe old painter regain its youth and, with the artist\'s habit, disrobeas it were the beauteous form of the young girl. He was seized with thejealous frenzy of a true lover.""Gillette!"" he cried; ""let us go.""At this cry, with its accent of love, his mistress raised her eyesjoyfully and looked at him; then she ran into his arms.""Ah! you love me still?"" she whispered, bursting into tears.Though she had had strength to hide her suffering, she had none to hideher joy.""Let me have her for one moment,"" exclaimed the old master, ""and youshall compare her with my Catherine. Yes, yes; I consent!""There was love in the cry of Frenhofer as in that of Poussin, mingledwith jealous coquetry on behalf of his semblance of a woman; he seemedto revel in the triumph which the beauty of his virgin was about to winover the beauty of the living woman.""Do not let him retract,"" cried Porbus, striking Poussin on theshoulder. ""The fruits of love wither in a day; those of art areimmortal.""""Can it be,"" said Gillette, looking steadily at Poussin and at Porbus,""that I am nothing more than a woman to him?""She raised her head proudly; and as she glanced at Frenhofer withflashing eyes she saw her lover gazing once more at the picture he hadformerly taken for a Giorgione.""Ah!"" she cried, ""let us go in; he never looked at me like that!""""Old man!"" said Poussin, roused from his meditation by Gillette\'s voice,""see this sword. I will plunge it into your heart at the first cry ofthat young girl. I will set fire to your house, and no one shall escapefrom it. Do you understand me?""His look was gloomy and the tones of his voice were terrible. Hisattitude, and above all the gesture with which he laid his hand uponthe weapon, comforted the poor girl, who half forgave him for thussacrificing her to his art and to his hopes of a glorious future.Porbus and Poussin remained outside the closed door of the atelier,looking at one another in silence. At first the painter of the EgyptianMary uttered a few exclamations: ""Ah, she unclothes herself!""--""He tellsher to stand in the light!""--""He compares them!"" but he grew silent ashe watched the mournful face of the young man; for though old paintershave none of such petty scruples in presence of their art, yet theyadmire them in others, when they are fresh and pleasing. The young manheld his hand on his sword, and his ear seemed glued to the panel of thedoor. Both men, standing darkly in the shadow, looked like conspiratorswaiting the hour to strike a tyrant.""Come in! come in!"" cried the old man, beaming with happiness. ""My workis perfect; I can show it now with pride. Never shall painter, brushes,colors, canvas, light, produce the rival of Catherine Lescaut, theBeautiful Nut-girl.""Porbus and Poussin, seized with wild curiosity, rushed into the middleof a vast atelier filled with dust, where everything lay in disorder,and where they saw a few paintings hanging here and there upon thewalls. They stopped before the figure of a woman, life-sized and halfnude, which filled them with eager admiration.""Do not look at that,"" said Frenhofer, ""it is only a daub which I madeto study a pose; it is worth nothing. Those are my errors,"" he added,waving his hand towards the enchanting compositions on the walls aroundthem.At these words Porbus and Poussin, amazed at the disdain which themaster showed for such marvels of art, looked about them for the secrettreasure, but could see it nowhere.""There it is!"" said the old man, whose hair fell in disorder about hisface, which was scarlet with supernatural excitement. His eyes sparkled,and his breast heaved like that of a young man beside himself with love.""Ah!"" he cried, ""did you not expect such perfection? You stand before awoman, and you are looking for a picture! There are such depths on thatcanvas, the air within it is so true, that you are unable to distinguishit from the air you breathe. Where is art? Departed, vanished! Here isthe form itself of a young girl. Have I not caught the color, the verylife of the line which seems to terminate the body? The same phenomenonwhich we notice around fishes in the water is also about objects whichfloat in air. See how these outlines spring forth from the background.Do you not feel that you could pass your hand behind those shoulders?For seven years have I studied these effects of light coupled withform. That hair,--is it not bathed in light? Why, she breathes! Thatbosom,--see! Ah! who would not worship it on bended knee? The fleshpalpitates! Wait, she is about to rise; wait!""""Can you see anything?"" whispered Poussin to Porbus.""Nothing. Can you?""""No.""The two painters drew back, leaving the old man absorbed in ecstasy,and tried to see if the light, falling plumb upon the canvas at which hepointed, had neutralized all effects. They examined the picture, movingfrom right to left, standing directly before it, bending, swaying,rising by turns.""Yes, yes; it is really a canvas,"" cried Frenhofer, mistaking thepurpose of their examination. ""See, here is the frame, the easel; theseare my colors, my brushes."" And he caught up a brush which he held outto them with a naive motion.""The old rogue is making game of us,"" said Poussin, coming close to thepretended picture. ""I can see nothing here but a mass of confused color,crossed by a multitude of eccentric lines, making a sort of paintedwall.""""We are mistaken. See!"" returned Porbus.Coming nearer, they perceived in a corner of the canvas the point of anaked foot, which came forth from the chaos of colors, tones, shadowshazy and undefined, misty and without form,--an enchanting foot, aliving foot. They stood lost in admiration before this glorious fragmentbreaking forth from the incredible, slow, progressive destructionaround it. The foot seemed to them like the torso of some Grecian Venus,brought to light amid the ruins of a burned city.""There is a woman beneath it all!"" cried Porbus, calling Poussin\'sattention to the layers of color which the old painter had successivelylaid on, believing that he thus brought his work to perfection. The twomen turned towards him with one accord, beginning to comprehend, thoughvaguely, the ecstasy in which he lived.""He means it in good faith,"" said Porbus.""Yes, my friend,"" answered the old man, rousing from his abstraction,""we need faith; faith in art. We must live with our work for yearsbefore we can produce a creation like that. Some of these shadows havecost me endless toil. See, there on her cheek, below the eyes, a fainthalf-shadow; if you observed it in Nature you might think it couldhardly be rendered. Well, believe me, I took unheard-of pains toreproduce that effect. My dear Porbus, look attentively at my work, andyou will comprehend what I have told you about the manner of treatingform and outline. Look at the light on the bosom, and see how by aseries of touches and higher lights firmly laid on I have managed tograsp light itself, and combine it with the dazzling whiteness of theclearer tones; and then see how, by an opposite method,--smoothing offthe sharp contrasts and the texture of the color,--I have been able,by caressing the outline of my figure and veiling it with cloudyhalf-tints, to do away with the very idea of drawing and all otherartificial means, and give to the form the aspect and roundness ofNature itself. Come nearer, and you will see the work more distinctly;if too far off it disappears. See! there, at that point, it is, I think,most remarkable."" And with the end of his brush he pointed to a spot ofclear light color.Porbus struck the old man on the shoulder, turning to Poussin as he didso, and said, ""Do you know that he is one of our greatest painters?""""He is a poet even more than he is a painter,"" answered Poussin gravely.""There,"" returned Porbus, touching the canvas, ""is the ultimate end ofour art on earth.""""And from thence,"" added Poussin, ""it rises, to enter heaven.""""How much happiness is there!--upon that canvas,"" said Porbus.The absorbed old man gave no heed to their words; he was smiling at hisvisionary woman.""But sooner or later, he will perceive that there is nothing there,""cried Poussin.""Nothing there!--upon my canvas?"" said Frenhofer, looking first at thetwo painters, and then at his imaginary picture.""What have you done?"" cried Porbus, addressing Poussin.The old man seized the arm of the young man violently, and said to him,""You see nothing?--clown, infidel, scoundrel, dolt! Why did you comehere? My good Porbus,"" he added, turning to his friend, ""is it possiblethat you, too, are jesting with me? Answer; I am your friend. Tell me,can it be that I have spoiled my picture?""Porbus hesitated, and feared to speak; but the anxiety painted on thewhite face of the old man was so cruel that he was constrained to pointto the canvas and utter the word, ""See!""Frenhofer looked at his picture for a space of a moment, and staggered.""Nothing! nothing! after toiling ten years!""He sat down and wept.""Am I then a fool, an idiot? Have I neither talent nor capacity? Am Ino better than a rich man who walks, and can only walk? Have I indeedproduced nothing?""He gazed at the canvas through tears. Suddenly he raised himself proudlyand flung a lightning glance upon the two painters.""By the blood, by the body, by the head of Christ, you are envious menwho seek to make me think she is spoiled, that you may steal her fromme. I--I see her!"" he cried. ""She is wondrously beautiful!""At this moment Poussin heard the weeping of Gillette as she stood,forgotten, in a corner.""What troubles thee, my darling?"" asked the painter, becoming once morea lover.""Kill me!"" she answered. ""I should be infamous if I still loved thee,for I despise thee. I admire thee; but thou hast filled me with horror.I love, and yet already I hate thee.""While Poussin listened to Gillette, Frenhofer drew a green curtainbefore his Catherine, with the grave composure of a jeweller lockinghis drawers when he thinks that thieves are near him. He cast at the twopainters a look which was profoundly dissimulating, full of contempt andsuspicion; then, with convulsive haste, he silently pushed them throughthe door of his atelier. When they reached the threshold of his house hesaid to them, ""Adieu, my little friends.""The tone of this farewell chilled the two painters with fear.              *     *     *     *     *On the morrow Porbus, alarmed, went again to visit Frenhofer, and foundthat he had died during the night, after having burned his paintings.End of Project Gutenberg\'s The Hidden Masterpiece, by Honore de Balzac END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HIDDEN MASTERPIECE ** This file should be named 1553.txt or 1553.zip **This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/5/1553/Produced by John Bickers, and DagnyUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.
